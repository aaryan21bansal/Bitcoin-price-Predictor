"Kenzo was known for his love of graphics and bright colours The Japanese founder of popular fashion brand Kenzo has died aged 81, from complications linked to coronavirus. Tributes have poured in from all across the world for Kenzo Takada who died at the American Hospital in Paris. Known for his bright graphics, jungle inspired prints and eclectic use of colour, he was the first Japanese designer to gain prominence on the Paris fashion scene. He settled in France in the 1960s and spent the rest of his career there. With his ""nearly 8,000 designs"", the Japanese designer ""never stopped celebrating fashion and the art of living"", his spokesman said. Paris MayorAnne Hidalgo paid tribute to him on Twitter,external: ""Designer of immense talent, he had given colour and light their place in fashion. Paris is now mourning one of its sons."" ""I was a fan of the brand in the 1970s when he started. I think he was a great designer,""fashion news website WWD.com quoted Sidney Toledano,external, CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH which owns the Kenzo brand, as saying. The rebirth of Japanese design Many Japanese Twitter users posted their condolences on the platform, some of whom shared that their first ever luxury product was one from Kenzo. ""The first wallet I ever owned was from Kenzo,"" said one Twitter user. ""Even though it's a small thing - I'll always remember it. Rest in Peace."" ""I have a Kenzo [outfit] passed down from my mum,"" said another. ""I still wear it."" Many others said they owned Kenzo handkerchiefs - an accessory which is still popular in Japan. Born in 1939 in Himeji, near the city of Osaka, Kenzo Takada decided to make his way by boat to Paris in 1965, despite hardly speaking any French. At first he sold sketches to fashion houses but later decided to strike it out on his own, with a small store called Jungle Jap. ""I decorated the shop myself with little money,""Takada told the South China Morning Post newspaper recently,external, in what was one of his last media interviews. ""One of the first paintings I saw in Paris and fell in love with was a jungle painting... and that was the inspiration for the shop."" His clothes were heavily influenced by Japanese designs. Takada said he didn't want to ""do what French designers were doing"". ""His native Japan remained [the] source of inspiration for every collection he did. He kept the use of vibrant colours and volumes present at all times,"" said Circe Henestrosa, head of the school of fashion at Singapore's Lasalle College of the Arts. ""I think he was ahead of his time and was one of the first designers to experiment with the idea of genderless fashion. He would never conform to the stereotypical idea of masculine and feminine fashion,"" said Ms Henestrosa. Kenzo Takada during his autumn-winter 1983-1984 fashion show in Paris Takada's ""big break"" finally came when fashion magazine Elle put one of his looks on their cover, and when international fashion magazine editors attended his fashion show in 1971, he told SCMP. There was controversy over the brand initially, as Takada had called himself and his label ""Jap"" - a term that some in the United States found offensive, which he discovered when he started reaching out to the American market. ""I knew it had a pejorative meaning,""he told the New York Times in a 1972 interview.,external""But I thought if I did something good, I would change the meaning."" Takada rechristened the label with his first name - and thus Kenzo the brand was born. It flourished and became an internationally known fashion label, adding a menswear line in 1983 and then more casual sportswear lines Kenzo Jeans and Kenzo Jungle. Kenzo fragrances and eyewear soon followed. Then, at the height of the brand's success in the 1990s, Takada sold it to LVMH. ""The hardest year of my life was 1990, when my life partner Xavier died and my business partner had a stroke,"" he told SCMP. ""That's why I sold the company to LVMH [in 1993]. I felt I couldn't do it on my own."" He stayed at the label for a few years and retired from fashion in 1999 at the age of 60. But even in his retirement he remained active creatively, designing costumes for opera productions and taking up painting. ""He was supposed to be in Paris only for two years [but] spent the rest of his life there. He took Paris by storm,"" said Ms Henestrosa. ""As [fashion journalist] Suzy Menkes said, 'he wanted to make happy clothes'. His work was avant-garde... it is sad when creative minds like Kenzo leave this world.""

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Royal Opera House is to sell a David Hockney portrait of its former boss in a bid to raise money to plug a shortfall caused by the pandemic. The painting of Sir David Webster will be auctioned at Christie's this month and is expected to fetch up to Â£18m. Current chief executive Alex Beard said it was ""tough call"" to sell the picture, but there was no alternative if the organisation was to survive. ""We have to face the situation we are in... and get through this,"" he said. The London venue, home of international opera and the Royal Ballet, is the UK's biggest arts employer. It says it has lost Â£3 in every Â£5 of its income since the national lockdown forced it to close its doors in March. The sale of the Hockney portrait is part of a four-pronged plan to help the venue balance the books. There will also be significant redundancies and a fundraising appeal for public donations. In addition, the opera house has applied for a loan to the government's culture recovery fund. BBC to broadcast Royal Opera House reopening Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package Lloyd Webber says arts are at 'point of no return' ""We knew we had to look at any assets we had,"" said Mr Beard. ""And there is only really one of any note that stands out and that is this portrait."" ""If we can remain viable and get through this, then we can get back to employing people in the future."" Sir David Webster ran the Royal Opera House between 1945 and 1970 and played a key role in the establishment of the Royal Ballet and Royal Opera companies at Covent Garden. Hockney was commissioned to paint his portrait - which in recent years hung in the Covent Garden venue - after he stepped down in the 1970s. It depicts Sir David sitting in profile, in front of a glass-topped coffee table and a vase of pink tulips. According to the Christie's catalogue, the picture was ""the first of a rare handful of commissions completed by Hockney: he would not accept another until three decades later, when he painted Sir George and Lady Mary Christie of Glyndebourne for the National Portrait Gallery"". Mr Beard said the artist had been notified of the impending sale: ""We have a good relationship, but he does not much like it when any of his work is auctioned,""he told the Observer,external. The Royal Opera House reopened in June with a concert which was broadcast on TV, radio and online - but without a live audience. At the time, Mr Beard said the venue, in common with many theatres and arts venues, was facing ""unprecedented financial stress"". Mr Beard was understood to have taken ""a significant reduction"" in pay, while music director Sir Antonio Pappano waived his salary during lockdown. Last week, the Royal Opera House announced a limited return of public performances of ballet and opera, in front of a reduced audience, beginning later this month. Among the productions it is hoping to stage is The Nutcracker, a traditional part of its Christmas programme since 1984.

"Transport for London (TfL), the capital's transport authority, has not renewed the licence of Indian taxi app Ola over public safety concerns. The cab company has been operating in London since February. TfL said the firm reported a number of failings including more than 1,000 trips made by unlicensed drivers. Ola said it will appeal the decision and has 21 days to do so. It can operate in the meantime, according to the appeal rules. The transport authority said Ola did not report the failings as soon as it knew about them. ""Through our investigations we discovered that flaws in Ola's operating model have led to the use of unlicensed drivers and vehicles in more than 1,000 passenger trips, which may have put passenger safety at risk,"" Helen Chapman, TfL's director of licensing, regulation and charging, said. ""If they do appeal, Ola can continue to operate and drivers can continue to undertake bookings on behalf of Ola. We will closely scrutinise the company to ensure passengers safety is not compromised."" The ride-hailing company began operating in Cardiff in 2018 and has since spread to other UK locations. ""We have been working with TfL during the review period and have sought to provide assurances and address the issues raised in an open and transparent manner,"" Marc Rozendal, Ola's UK Managing Director, said in a statement. ""Ola will take the opportunity to appeal this decision and in doing so, our riders and drivers can rest assured that we will continue to operate as normal, providing safe and reliable mobility for London."" Last week, major rival Uber secured its right to continue operating in London after a judge upheld its appeal against TfL. The ride-hailing giant has been granted a new licence to work in the capital, nearly a year after TfL rejected its application, also over safety concerns because of unlicensed drivers.

"The difference in rules for Oldham and Manchester has drawn criticism Northern England faces a ""winter of dangerous discontent"" unless the test and trace system improves, the mayor of Greater Manchester has warned. Andy Burnham said the system was the ""first line of defence against the virus"" and the government were ""over-relying"" on restrictions. Extra rules are now in forcefor a growing number of areas in the North. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Boris Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if the restrictions were working. The prime minister said: ""The advice that we're getting is that, in these areas where we have got stringent local lockdowns, we need to wait and see whether the R [infection rate] starts to come down because some of these things have been intensified [â¦] just in the last few days."" Andy Burnham has warned of a widening north-south divide Mr Burnham said: ""If there are to be local restrictions, they must come with local control of test and trace, a local furlough scheme, and support for our councils and businesses. ""Put it under local control because the government are using call centres to try and contact people, but we will put boots on the ground and I am absolutely certain that that approach will be more successful."" He also urged the government to consult more with local authorities and clarify rules for neighbouring areas, which he said were ""inconsistent"". In Greater Manchester,funerals are limited to 30 people,external, except Oldham, where they are restricted to 20 people sincefurther rules were enforced in Augustto curb the spread of coronavirus. However, the rate of cases has recently risen to 336 per 100,000 people in Manchester, while dropping to 177 per 100,000 in Oldham. Boris Johnson was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show The prime minister said he ""understands people's frustrations"", adding: ""No one has come up with any better proposals that I am aware of."" Mr Burnham also voiced concern the North West would be ""levelled down by not just the virus but by the government's failure to support us"". ""It was frankly unforgiveable that businesses in Bolton were closed down without the people working given support with their wages. That is going to cause massive damage if that approach continues. ""This could be a winter of dangerous discontent here in the north of England and I think the prime minister needs to wake up to that. ""I think there's a very real and present danger that Covid-19 is going to widen the north-south divide because we are heading into a winter where the north of England is under restrictions unlike the south.""

"Cineworld is set to temporarily close its UK cinemas in the coming weeks. As first reported inthe Sunday Times,external, the firm is writing to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden to say the industry is now ""unviable"". The firm says it has been hit by delays in the release of big-budget films, putting 5,500 jobs at risk. The premiere of James Bond film No Time To Die has been postponed twice and is now due for release in April 2021. It is hoped that the Cineworld cinemas will be able to reopen next year, with staff being asked to accept redundancy in the hope of rejoining the company when theatres open again. The head of the UK Cinema Association said he feared the Cineworld closure was ""indicative of challenges faced by the entire UK cinema industry at the moment"". Phil Clapp said: ""Although cinemas opened in July and have been able to deliver a safe and enjoyable experience, without major new titles then we understand we aren't able to get as many people out of the home as we'd like."" The Bectu union says the delay in releasing the new Bond film has hit cinemas He said no-one would be ""untouched by the current challenges"". Philippa Childs of entertainment and broadcasting union Bectu said: ""The delay in the release of the Bond film along with the other delayed releases has plunged cinema into crisis. ""Studios will have to think carefully when considering release dates about the impact that will have for the long-term future of the big screen."" When approached by the BBC, major UK chains Vue and Odeon refused to comment on how many cinemas they might be keeping open. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it was supporting cinemas through a VAT cut on tickets and concessions, business rates holiday and bounce-back loans. ""We urge the British public to support their local cinema and save jobs by visiting and enjoying a film in accordance with the [Covid-19] guidance."" Cineworld's sites in the US, where it operates 546 theatres, could also be forced to close. Cineworld said in a statement: ""We can confirm we are considering the temporary closure of our UK and US cinemas, but a final decision has not yet been reached. ""Once a decision has been made we will update all staff and customers as soon as we can."" In September the firm reported a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June as its cinemas had to close because of coronavirus lockdowns. And it warned at the time that it might need to raise more money in the event of further restrictions - or film delays - due to Covid-19. Cineworld directors waive salaries as virus impact hits Tenet gives shot in arm to UK and Ireland cinemas What are the new coronavirus restrictions? Cineworld is the world's second largest cinema operator, and the largest in the UK with 120 sites. It also owns the Picturehouse chain of smaller venues. Its other theatres globally include the Regal, Cinema City, and Yes Planet brands. According to the UK Cinema Association, operators should ""organise seating to ensure two-metre distancing can be maintained; where two metres is not viable, one metre with risk mitigation is acceptable. Mitigations should be considered and those introduced set out in the risk assessment"". But in Scotland they must ""organise seating to ensure two-metre distancing can be maintained"". It also says cinemas should introduce one-way flow through auditoriums, and provide floor markings and signage to remind customers to ""follow social distancing wherever possible."" The film industry had hoped the release of No Time To Die would spark a movie-going revival in the UK, with so many cinemas having been mothballed for months following the Covid-19 lockdown in March. But on Friday the movie's release was further delayed until 2 April 2021 ""in order to be seen by a worldwide theatrical audience"". Rob Arthur, an industry analyst at cinema strategists The Big Picture, said ""the current market is broken"". ""It has been a very challenging year both for Cineworld, and the world's largest cinema group AMC,"" he added. ""Film release schedules are being changed on a daily, never mind weekly, basis. It has been a catastrophic, devastating, year for operators."" He said the decision by Cineworld to put their UK operation ""into hibernation"" until next year made sense. ""You can't keep meeting the fixed operating costs of electricity, gas, air conditioning, staff, social distancing measures, and so forth when audience numbers are only a small percentage of what they were before,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, customer confidence in visiting cinemas has to be restored and I don't see that at the moment,"" Mr Arthur added. ""The crowds you used to see in London for example going from work directly to the cinema are not there."" He also said Cineworld's cash reserves were running low and that both they and AMC had a high percentage of financial liabilities compared with their assets. He added: ""Landlords to date have acted reasonably and the deferral of rent has helped the cinema industry, but that comes to an end as does furlough payments so the operators will have to seek remedies to restructure their businesses."" As lockdown restrictions around the world were gradually lifted in mid-to-late summer Cineworld had been able to reopen 561 out of 778 sites worldwide. But lockdown closures meant its group revenues sank to $712.4m in the first six months of the year, compared with $2.15bn a year earlier. The group loss this year also marked a huge fall from the pre-tax profits of $139.7m seen in the first six months of 2019. However, when it released those financial figures, Cineworld said recent trading had been ""encouraging considering the circumstances"", with solid demand for Christopher Nolan's spy film Tenet which was released in September. In June, Cineworld pulled out of a $2.1bn deal to buy the Canadian cinema chain Cineplex, a move which could lead to a legal battle. It is not just Cineworld which has struggled this year, with independent London cinema Peckhamplex closing its doors on 25 September due to falling visitor numbers and delayed releases. It had hoped to reopen in November, around the time the next James Bond film was due to be released.

"This video can not be played President Trump pays ""surprise visit"" to supporters outside hospital US President Donald Trump remains under scrutiny as he stays in hospital for Covid-19 treatment. There is scepticism over the prospect - raised by doctors earlier - that he could leave on Monday as questions continue over the seriousness of his illness. His oxygen level dipped twice and he received a steroid treatment. On Sunday, he made a surprise public appearance in a drive-past to greet supporters, drawing criticism. ""More than 205,000 Americans are dead. We need leadership. Not photo ops,""tweeted Hakeem Jeffries,external, chairman of the Democrats in the US House of Representatives. Wearing a mask, the president waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would leave Walter Reed hospital to pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside. A doctor at the hospital strongly criticised the president's motorcade ride due to the infection risk inside the car. ""That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of Covid-19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures,""Dr James Philips tweeted,external. He said that those inside the president's car would need to quarantine for 14 days and are at risk of getting ill. Earlier, it emerged that the president's condition was more serious than previously reported when he went to hospital Friday evening. The White House had said that Mr Trump was experiencing ""mild symptoms"" of Covid-19, but it was confirmed at the weekend that he received supplemental oxygen after his levels dipped twice within two days. He was given the steroid dexamethasone, which is normally reserved for serious cases, according to experts. However, Mr Trump sought to project an image of strength, tweeting images of himself appearing to work from the hospital and a video message teasing his surprise drive past. Read the latest updates here Unanswered questions about Trump's Covid crisis Who Trump met - and who's tested positive 'We're here to tell him that we love him' In a tweet, the president - dressed in a suit jacket and shirt with no tie - said:""I learned a lot about Covid.,externalI learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn't the let's read the books school. I get it and I understand it. It's a very interesting thing, I'll be letting you know about it."" The president's diagnosis, which he made public in a tweet early on Friday, has upended his election campaign. Mr Trump faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden on 3 November. Earlier at the weekend, Mr Trump's doctors said that the president continued to improve and might be discharged as soon as Monday. However, Dr Sean Conley, the White House physician, disclosed that the president's oxygen level dropped twice since his diagnosis, and he was started on dexamethasone. The president was given extra oxygen at least once after testing positive, said Dr Conley, who also sought to clarify earlier confusion caused by conflicting statements about Mr Trump's condition. Speaking at a news conference at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center close to Washington DC, Dr Conley said Mr Trump's oxygen level dropped for the first time on Friday morning at the White House. The president had a high fever, he said, and an oxygen level below 94% - a healthy person's level is 95% or higher. The second episode happened on Saturday, when the level dropped below 93%. When questioned, Dr Conley did not say whether the president had received oxygen but added that, if it had happened, ""it was very limited"". The team, Dr Conley said, decided to give Mr Trump dexamethasone,which is shown in studies to improve survival for patients in hospitalwith severe Covid-19. This video can not be played Dr Sean Conley confirmed that President Trump was given supplemental oxygen on Friday morning Steroids calm down inflammation and the immune system and are already used in conditions like arthritis and asthma as well as in some severe infections. The drugs are not thought to be helpful in the early stages of a coronavirus infection. ""Given the timeline where [Mr Trump] is in the course of illness, we're trying to maximise everything that we can do for himâ¦ We decided that in this case the potential benefits early on in the course probably outweighed any risks at this time,"" Dr Conley said. Dr Conley also addresseda conflicting account about the president's healthgiven shortly after his briefing on Saturday by the White House chief of staff. Mark Meadows said Mr Trump's vital signs over the previous 24 hours had been ""very concerning"" and that the next 48 hours would be critical. ""I think his statement was misconstrued,"" the doctor said. However, he acknowledged giving an overly upbeat description of Mr Trump's condition a day earlier: ""I didn't want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction. And in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn't necessarily true."" This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test The president, being 74, a man and someone categorised as obese, is in a higher-risk category for Covid-19. On Friday he was given an experimental drug cocktail injection and started a five-day course of antiviral medication remdesivir. Dr Brian Garibaldi, who is also part of the team treating the president, said: ""He feels well, he's been up and around and our plan for today is to have him to eat and drink, be up out of bed as much as possible to be mobile."" In pictures: Trump supporters hold rallies The Trump doctor in the eye of the storm The doctors said the president had not had a fever since Friday and that his liver and kidney functions had remained normal. But Dr Conley refused to answer questions on whether lung scans showed any damage. How significant is it that Donald Trump has been given dexamethasone? The steroid saves lives by calming the immune system, which can become dangerously overactive in Covid, but needs to be used at the right time. Give it too early and the drug could make things worse by impairing the body's ability to fight off the virus. This is not a drug you would usually give in the ""mild"" stage of the disease. The Recovery Trial, which took place in the UK,showed the benefit kicked in at the point people need oxygen,external- which Mr Trump briefly did. The World Health Organization translated those findings to adviseusing the steroid in ""severe and critical"" cases.,external Mr Trump's blood oxygen levels did dip below 94%, which is one of theNational Institutes of Health criteria for ""severe illness"".,externalHowever, those low oxygen levels were not sustained and the gap between someone needing transient oxygen support and end-stage Covid-19 is massive. We do not know the full details of Mr Trump's condition, but it is hard to imagine you or I would be discharged from hospital while taking dexamethasone and remdesivir and after being given an experimental antibody therapy.  However, we do not have the medical support at the US president's disposal. A number of people around the president have tested positive, including First Lady Melania Trump. Many of them attendeda meeting at the White House last weekendthat is being scrutinised as a possible ""super-spreader event"". Other people to have tested positive around Mr Trump include close aide Hope Hicks - believed to be the first to show symptoms - campaign manager Bill Stepien and former White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway. Nicholas Luna, the latest person reported to have tested positive, is a personal assistant or ""body man"" of the president and is in constant contact with Mr Trump. The president's campaignÂ team said on Saturday it would move forward ""at full speed""Â until Mr Trump could return to the campaignÂ trail.Â It is calling on top ""surrogates"", including Mr Trump's sons Donald Jr and Eric, and Vice-President Mike Pence toÂ ""carry the campaign forward"" for the time being. No White House events are scheduled for Monday. Meanwhile, Mr Pence is due to debate Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Wednesday. Joe Biden, who has continuedÂ his campaign, is due to make appearances in Miami, Florida on Monday - despite having shared a stage with Mr Trump last Tuesday, when the president may have already contracted the virus. Mr Biden's campaign said he tested negative for the virus on Sunday evening. In an interview to CBS' Face the Nation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said Republicans in Congress and the president had ""for a long time... been anti-science"" and that she hoped that Mr Trump's positive diagnosis would change his attitude towards the virus. ""I pray that in addition to his health, that the president's heart will be open to the millions of people who have been affected,"" she said. ""I hope it will be a signal that we really have to do better in preventing the spread of this virus.""

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. The president announced that he and his wife and his wife,Melaniahas tested positive for Covid-19, in a tweet sent on Friday at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Who is Hope Hicks? How will this affect US election? So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact-tracing. Here's a look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"": President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, JudgeAmy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn. This video can not be played Senator Mike Lee, who later tested positive for Covid-19, seen hugging other attendees Judge Coney Barrett said on Friday that she had tested negative. Sources told US media she had the virus earlier this year. Along with Mr Trump and his wife, at least seven other people who attended the Rose Garden event say they have tested positive - although it's not known where they caught the virus. They are: White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnany; former White House counsellorKellyanne Conway; SenatorMike Leeof Utah and SenatorThom Tillisof North Carolina, who are both on the judiciary committee; the president of the University of Notre Dame,John Jenkins; and former New Jersey GovernorChris Christie,who said he checked himself into a hospital on Saturday as a precaution. The White House Correspondents' Association said anunnamed reporterat the event had also tested positive with symptoms. During the evening, President Trump held a rally at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania. Since the afternoon's ceremony, Judge Coney Barrett has held meetings with various senators - including Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell- ahead of her much-anticipated confirmation hearing, due to take place on 12 October. The president played golf at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, in the morning and led a White House reception for the families of military veterans during the evening. On Monday, President Trump held a news briefing in the White House Rose Garden - giving an update on his administration's coronavirus testing strategy. It was attended by Vice-PresidentMike Pence,Health SecretaryAlex Azar,Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories,Robert Ford, among others. Later, Trump viewed a model of a new pickup truck - being built at a factory in Ohio - on the White House lawn. Representatives from the company, Lordstown Motors, attended, as well as two members of Congress. The White House regularly tests officials who come in contact with the president. However, US media has noted that mask-wearing and social distancing around him is less common - suggesting that people may be too reliant on the testing system, which is not foolproof. The president faced his election rival,Joe Biden, at their first face-to-face debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday evening. President Trump flew there on his presidential plane, Air Force One, alongside his wife, adult children and multiple aides. Many were seen not wearing masks when boarding or disembarking. Also on the plane were: White House Chief of staffMark Meadows; campaign strategistJason Miller; policy adviserStephen Miller;Robert C O'Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Ohio CongressmanJim Jordan. After landing, the president's campaign manager,Bill Stepien, was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms Hicks, the New York Times reports. Late on Friday, it was announced that Mr Stepien had tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. The debate was held at Cleveland Clinic's Health Education Campus, a shared facility with Case Western Reserve University. The organisers, the Commission on Presidential Debates, brought in numerous Covid-era safety precautions. There were no handshakes between the two candidates and everyone attending - including the 80 or so audience members - was tested before the event and asked to wear masks throughout. In the run-up, Mr Trump's eldest daughter,Ivanka, posted a picture of herself backstage in a mask, alongside her sisterTiffany, sister-in-lawLaraand stepmotherMelania. Allow Instagram content?

However, during the event itself, Ivanka Trump and other family members, including siblingsDon JrandEric, were pictured mask-less. ModeratorChris Wallacehas since told Fox News that they were offered masks by event staff but they refused them. Observers said those on Mr Biden's side of the room kept their masks on. Mr Trump and Mr Biden kept a distance during the debate, at podiums on opposite sides of the stage. Mr Trump and Mr Biden loudly spoke over each other throughout the contentious debate When the candidates were greeted by the wives on stage afterwards,Jill Bidenwore a mask and Melania Trump didn't. At a separate campaign event in Pennsylvania, Vice-PresidentMike Pencesaid he had been in the Oval Office with President Trump earlier that day. It is thought to be their last in-person meeting. President Trump and much of his entourage flew back to Washington DC on Tuesday night. The day after the debate, President Trump was straight back into campaign business, flying to Minnesota. Ms Hicks was among those accompanying him. At a press conference on Saturday, the president's physician Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump had been diagnosed 72 hours previously, which would place his diagnosis on Wednesday. But the White House later clarified that he was diagnosed on Thursday. He attended a closed-door fundraiser at a private home in Minneapolis, and later held a rally at an airport in Duluth, in front of a crowd of thousands.

The president's rally at Duluth airport On Wednesday evening, Mr Trump and various aides returned to Washington DC on Air Force One again. Meanwhile Ms Hicks, who was feeling unwell, was isolated in a separate cabin, according to US media. She reportedly disembarked from the back of the plane, instead of the front alongside the other passengers. The following day, Ms Hicks tested positive for coronavirus. President Trump flew to his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraiser. Several aides who were in proximity to Ms Hicks scrapped their plans to accompany the president, according to the Associated Press. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, is thought to have been in close contact with Ms Hicks. Ms McEnany held a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, without mentioning her colleague's test and without wearing a mask. She has since said she did not know about the diagnosis. That night, in pre-taped remarks to the annual Al Smith dinner in New York City - held virtually this year - Mr Trump said that ""the end of the pandemic is in sight"". This video can not be played ""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" President Trump told a dinner on Thursday He later announced in an interview on Fox News that he and the first lady were being tested for the virus. It is not known how many supporters he came into contact with in recent days, he but told Fox presenter Sean Hannity that people were always wanting to get close to him. ""They want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,"" he said. President Trump announced that he and Mrs Trump had tested positive, adding that they will begin the ""quarantine and recovery process immediately"". Just before 11:00, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told reporters the president has ""mild symptoms"" but remains in ""good spirits"". Mrs Trump tweeted to say she also had mild symptoms. This video can not be played The president has ""mild symptoms"" but will ""remain on the job"", says White House chief of staff Mark Meadows That day, several other people announce that they've tested positive:Kellyanne Conway, former White House counsellor;Bill Stepien, Mr Trump's campaign manager;Mike Lee, Utah senator;Thom Tillis, a senator for North Carolina;Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee;Rev John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame University; and SenatorRon Johnson, head of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. MeanwhileJoe Biden, the Democrats' presidential candidate, tests negative, as does:Jill Biden, his wife; Vice PresidentMike Penceand his wifeKaren Pence;Kamala Harris, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate;Amy Coney Barrett, Supreme Court nominee;Mike Pompeo, secretary of state;Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary;Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services;William Barr, attorney general;Ivanka TrumpandDonald Trump Jr, the president's daughter and son; andJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. Former New Jersey governorChris ChristieandNicholas Luna, a White House presidential aide, both test positive. Mr Trump waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside the hospital. Inside the car, at least two people could be seen wearing protective gear in the front seats, with Mr Trump sat in the back. There were concerns that the president who wore a mask, may have endangered others inside the car. But White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the trip had been ""cleared by the medical team as safe"". White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnanyannounces on Twitter that she has tested positive.

"The North East will be in tier two of the government's new system The whole of the North East has entered a ""high"" Covid alert level in the government's new three-tier lockdown system. Nearly 2.7 million people in 11 council areas from Northumberland down to Redcarare in the second tier,externaland affected by restrictions from Wednesday. Here we try to answer some of your questions. Darlington, Stockton and Redcarwill now face additional measures similar to the ones already in place inTyneside, Wearside, Northumberland and County Durham. Socialising between households in any indoor setting, including homes, pubs and restaurants,will be against the law.,external People are only allowed to mix indoors with their own households or support bubbles. In other words, you can't go into your friend or relative's house - and you can't arrange to go for a drink or meal indoors with someone you don't live with. Thisalso applies if you travel outside of the affected areas,external. Schools and workplaces are not affected. These rules still apply toNewcastle, South Tyneside, North Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland, County Durham, Northumberland, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool,but they have actually eased slightly. Anyone in the North East can now meet in groups of up to six from different households anywhere outside, including in private gardens, parks, beaches and outdoor hospitality areas such as beer gardens.

Enter a full UK postcode or council name to find out This information was updated on 26 January at 10:15 GMT         If you cannot see the look-up clickhere,external. Anyone found to be breaking the rules could be dispersed by police. Those aged over 18 can be fined and could face a Â£200 bill for their first offence, which would be halved if paid within 14 days. Second offences would incur a Â£400 fine, which would then double for each subsequent offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Businesses breaking the rules can be fined up to Â£10,000. The restrictions will affect nearly 2.7 million people The rules say the hospitality industry has enhanced measures, such as risk assessments, one-way systems and mandatory taking of personal details for testing and tracing, which private homes do not have. Plus they have to close between 22:00 and 05:00 and only offer table service for food and drinks. Official support groups set up to help people can still meet, including ones helping victims of crime (including domestic abuse), people with addictions, new parents, people caring for others, sexuality and identity support groups, and people who have suffered bereavement. Yes, but there are some caveats. Childcare bubbles will be able to form to allow families to share caring responsibilities with another household, as long as it is only between those two households. This includes formal and informal arrangements, and at least one child must be 13 or under. People in support bubbles in these areas can also continue to meet in any setting. Children of parents who are separated can continue to move between homes. Yes. The national guidance still stands, so there are 15 people allowed at weddings and civil partnerships, and 30 people allowed at funerals. Pubs currently have a 22:00 curfew Yes, but the government wants people to reduce the number of journeys they make. If people need to travel, they should walk or cycle where possible, and plan ahead and avoid busy times and routes. Thegovernment's advice remains,externalthat you should try not to share a vehicle with those outside of your household or support bubble, but if you do need to, open the windows, wear masks and try to share with the same people. Yes,as long as you don't share accommodation with people you don't live or bubble with, or socialise with them in any indoor setting. The exception is the Liverpool City Region, which people are urged not to visit. If you go abroad, be aware of theself-isolation rules involving certain countriesand local advice. There are new signs warning people to maintain social distancing Yes. Registered tradespeoplecan go to work in homes,externalas long as they follow guidance on how to work safely, including social distancing, hand washing and potentially using screens. Yes, but outside for adults. Any adult inside sports must be socially distanced. Youth and disability sport can be held indoors as normal though. No-one knows.

"Boris Johnson is being urged to show he has got his ""mojo"" back, as the Conservatives' virtual conference gets under way. In January, the prime minister predicted that 2020 would be a ""fantastic year for Britain"". As forecasts go it was not the finest. Of course, no one could have predicted a global pandemic, and the impact it has had on the country's economy and way of life. And it is not hard to understand why his enthusiasm was uncurbed 10 months ago. After the chaos of a hung parliament, he'd delivered an 80-seat majority - the best general election result for the Conservatives for more than 30 years - and he was about to ""get Brexit done"". Some of his own colleagues believe he is a fairweather prime minister, and he's all at sea in turbulent political climes. But even during the coronavirus lockdown - and just before he was taken in to hospital - on 3 April, polling company YouGov gave the Conservatives a 52-28 lead over Labour. The main opposition party changed its own leader the day after. But even by mid-May, the governing party was leading by 48% to 33% in a YouGov survey. Johnson: Post-Brexit trade deal 'up to EU' Everybody got 'complacent' over virus, says PM Conservative MPs launch 'levelling up' taskforce Brady's 'win' shows Tory woe over Covid powers Going in to the virtual party conference season, the few clouds that were on the horizon in the spring now represent a gathering storm in the autumn. With Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer spending some months accusing the government of lacking competence, a mid-September YouGov poll suggested Labour and the Conservatives were neck-and-neck, on 40% apiece. Covid infections have risen significantly since the summer. The prime minister himselfseemed confused over some of the rulesthat he had introduced. There were rebellious noises from a swathe of his own backbenchers over a lack of scrutiny. There is nervousness on the Conservative benches over just how many jobs the new Job Retention Scheme will actually retain. And once private mutterings about the state of the prime minister's health have found their way in to the newspapers. Dominic Cummings remains the PM's closest adviser In The Spectator (the magazine Boris Johnson once edited), columnist Toby Youngconcluded last month,externalthat the prime minister's critics had been right about ""his inability to focus on anything for very long"". Yet only in April, the same Toby Young haddefended the PM,externalas a ""remarkable individual"" who ""cannot resist the pull of obligation to his country, the need to be of service"". And last month, Lord O'Donnell - formerly the UK's most senior civil servant - argued that the PM had ""expended' much of his political capital by defending the lockdown trip to Durham by his aide Dominic Cummings. Privately, some very senior Conservative MPs agree. One of them said to me: ""He is finding it hard to live with Dom, but he can't live without him. He is too dependent."" So can Boris Johnson use this week's Conservative conference to prevent simmering discontent - whether from voters or his own politicians -  from boiling over? The mood in the Parliamentary party is, at the very least, restless. Well-connected senior backbenchers have described the mood to me variously as ""apprehensive"", ""worrying"", ""bitter"" and ""concerning"". It isn't, as yet though, mutinous. Coronavirus has changed the face of the country There are deep concerns over the effect some of the lockdown measures are having on the economy. And some say - whatever the wider polling - that many grassroots members who were initially supportive of lockdown, want an assurance that the government will ""pull back from the precipice of doing it again"". One senior MP, who has been in direct touch with the prime minister, wants an explicit commitment in the coming week to rule out a new, national lockdown. But the concern goes deeper than what the government's measures are - there is also disquiet and discontent over how they have been introduced. The public complaints from some Conservative MPs over a lack of consultation and scrutiny is the tip of jagged iceberg. Beneath the surface, a frustration with how Mr Johnson's administration operates extends beyond the righteous anger of the sacked and the never-promoted. There has been a feeling that MPs have been treated as irrelevant at best and idiots - not even useful ones - at worst. ""There has been an attitude that they can just push anything through with a big majority and that attitude needs to be corrected,"" said one long-standing MP. A former minister complained that the PM's advisers ""are draining the life out of him, they are suffocating him"". Another said: ""There is a need for No 10 to build bridges"". So far this call for bridge-building, rather than bridge-burning, suggests that most Conservative MPs would like Mr Johnson to perform better, and perhaps behave better, rather than see him replaced. Indeed, some efforts at bridge building - such as a recent address to the backbench 1922 committee - between the prime minister and and his MPs has met with the approval of some in the Parliamentary party. But such is the mood at Westminster that one former adviser in the Boris Johnson administration believes that the main target audience of the prime minister's conference speech should be his own MPs. So what can he do to improve their morale and provide the wider public with a sense of his political mission? One of the most prominent Tory backbenchers feels Boris Johnson has already missed a trick. Instead of settling for a virtual conference, he believes that a physical, but socially-distanced event, would have provided a better sounding board for the prime minister. But rather like Toby Young, some former admirers of the prime minister are more critical now - they seek the return of the Old Boris, with a gleam in his eye. ""He must above all give a message of hope"", said one. Boris Johnson rarely gets to deliver good news these days Rather colourfully, a senior backbencher said he ""must banish the prophets of doom"", meaning the PM's scientific and medical advisers, and give a sense of where Britain would be when the virus is finally in retreat. Some say he needs to do more - mixing the Churchillian ""we'll get through it stuff"" with ""an apologetic, regretful tone on the need for draconian measures  - that that is not really him, or who we are"". One former minister said: ""We need him to make a case for modern Conservatism. What is the party for? Too many people just associate us with Brexit, the coronavirus and austerity."" There is a remarkable consensus on two points: That the speech shouldn't be a vehicle for policy-heavy announcements (though some would like to see a limited number designed to symbolise a direction of travel) That there must be a relentless focus on voters in the ""red wall"" seats that turned blue in December I say ""remarkable"" because some MPs representing seats that are deep blue are happy with a message directed at those in non-traditional seats. As one of them put it: ""The only reason we were elected to government was because of the swathe of red wall seats that came our way"". And a recent government adviser put it like this: ""These people made it clear on the doorsteps that they were only lending us their vote."" So what message will resonate with these vote-lenders? There is a feeling that a more voter-friendly phrase than ""levelling up"" - which dominates the conference fringe guide -  needs to be coined. It means spreading wealth and opportunity out of London and the South East of England - but there are complaints that it is too vague a concept for some of the party's more recent supporters. But insiders also argue against a return to the very clear ""Get Brexit done"" election mantra. ""Whether or not we get an agreement, people are just fed up hearing about it,"" one insider suggested. An MP who strongly campaigned both for Brexit and for Boris Johnson to lead the Conservatives told me: ""We now need a road map for the next few years, a sense of mission, as we move on - hopefully - from the Brexit era"". There is both hope and expectation that the PM will have more to say on the NHS, that symbolic infrastructure projects should be highlighted. And thatlast week's skills announcement, along with the language of ""radical change"" that accompanied it, will be built upon. ""We need flesh on the bones of the levelling up agenda. It has to be about more than a couple of shiny new train stations,"" said one member of the new intake, who defeated a Labour MP. It's also an unwritten rule of conference speeches that that party leaders take aim at their opponents. And there is an expectation , with next year's Holyrood elections looming, that the prime minister will have the SNP and not just Labour in his sights. It is likely to be intentional that the session which precedes the prime minister's speech on Tuesday is about defending the Union. Some Tory MPs are worried about draconian new laws Almost as important as the tone and content for some MPs will be body language. Last week, even though Covid has a long tail, Boris Johnson claimed he was ""fit as a butcher's dog"". Yet those who are claiming that the post-Covid prime minister resembles more of an emaciated stray seem to be getting a willing hearing in what are usually supportive newspapers. Some of those the prime minister has met in recent weeks say he is back to his usual self and don't recognise the downbeat portrait being painted of him. The prime minister himself told the BBC the idea that he wasn't his old self was ""sinister disinformation"". His conference speech will give him an opportunity to exude the impression that he is up to, and up for, the job. What has got some Conservative MPs scratching their heads is why the usually outwardly ebullient prime minister has so often been the main bearer of bad news during the Covid crisis. Sure, there is the talk of ""moonshots"" and ""building back better"" - distant sunlit uplands - but on a day-to-day basis he has had to front up what one MP described as ""police state"" restrictions, while leaving the ""good cop"" announcements to his Chancellor. A strategist who has worked with and for various ministers wondered why the prime minister hadn't ""nicked"" the best announcements for himself. He described Chancellor Rishi Sunak's ""hugely popular"" Eat Out to Help Out scheme as the ""promote Rishi"" campaign. He now felt Boris Johnson should reclaim some of the economic agenda, ""making it clear some businesses that otherwise would have gone under only exist because of this prime minister"". One former minister felt the shine could soon come off the chancellor, saying: ""What happens when Father Christmas turns in to Scrooge?"" Significantly, Labour , too, are focussing, laser-like, some of their political attacks on the Chancellor not the prime minister. One Tory MP with a background in government felt there was plenty of ""unexploded ordnance"". In due course, what - and how much - to tax will potentially put the chancellor in the firing line. But for now, Mr Sunak - who will make his conference speech on Monday - hands things out to voters, rather than takes them away. There are deep mutterings about whether some in government would like to see Rishi Sunak's profile grow to the proportions of a credible replacement for - but not challenger to - his next door neighbour should the need arise. One MP described it as ""an insurance policy"". Another MP cautions that ""we are not there yet"" but waxes lyrical about the chancellor's ability to devise and implement bold policies- and, crucially, to wrap them in a coherent Conservative narrative. He contrasts Mr Sunak favourably with many of his cabinet colleagues: ""They are not so much the tall poppies, but the weeds."" But a strong supporter of Boris Johnson said: 'I'm not so interested in the machinations between 10 and 11. ""The acolytes on both sides know it was Boris that won it. Rishi is Robin to Boris's batman."" There are perhaps far more challenges ahead for the prime minister than he envisaged when he declared that this would be a fantastic year  - but dissent hasn't led to any attempted dethronement. As one MP put it: ""He won us the election and, on his game, he can win us the next one."" One adviser put it slightly differently: ""The only question the conference has to answer is this: does Bojo have his mojo back?""

"A technical glitch that meant nearly 16,000 cases of coronavirus went unreported has delayed efforts to trace contacts of people who tested positive. Public Health England said 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. They were then added in to reachSaturday's figure of 12,872 new casesandSunday's 22,961 figure. PHE said all those who tested positive had been informed. But it means others in close contact with them were not. The issue has been resolved, PHE said, with outstanding cases passed on to tracers by 01:00 BST on Saturday. The technical issue also means that the daily case totals reported on the government's coronavirus dashboard over the past week have been lower than the true number. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said daily figures for the end of the week were ""actually nearer 11,000"", rather than the about 7,000 reported. Labour has described the glitch as ""shambolic"". The BBC has been told by senior public health officials in the north-west of England that a significant proportion of the unreported cases are from the area. Cities such as Liverpool and Manchester already have among the highest infection rates in the country, at about 10 times the national average. BBC analysis found the number of cases reported for the week to 1 October increased by 92.6% in the north west after taking in the missing tests - with similar rises reflected across England. The increase is mostly down to the missing tests, but the figures also included some results which came back after 2 October. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I can't give you those figures but all those people are being contacted"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the cases data had been ""truncated"" and ""lost"", but added all people who had tested positive had been contacted and the tracers were ""now working through all the contacts"". How many cases are there in your area? What are the Covid rules where you live? Meanwhile, the head of the government's vaccine taskforce, Kate Bingham, has told theFinancial Times,externalthat less than half of the UK population could be vaccinated against coronavirus. ""There is going to be no vaccination of people under 18,"" she said. ""It's an adult-only vaccine for people over 50, focusing on health workers, care home workers and the vulnerable."" Mr Johnsonhas warned it could be ""bumpy through to Christmas""and beyond as the UK deals with coronavirus. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, the PM said there was ""hope"" of beating Covid, and called on the public to ""act fearlessly but with common sense"". In aninterview with the Sun,external, Rishi Sunak has defended his Eat Out to Help Out scheme, saying he had ""no regrets"", after suggestions it may have helped fuel the second wave of coronavirus cases. At a time when the testing system has come under intense scrutiny after reports of delays and a system struggling to keep up with demand, the latest revelation could not have come at a more awkward moment for the government at Westminster. Because the nearly 16,000 extra positive test results had been not entered into the test and trace system, their recent contacts were not immediately followed up. Experts advise that ideally contacts should be tracked down within 48 hours. Officials say the technical problem - thought to be IT related - has been resolved, with all the new cases added into totals reported over the weekend. But all this will hardly improve public confidence in the testing system in England. And it muddies the waters for policy makers and officials trying to track the spread of the virus at what the prime minister has called a ""critical moment"". On Sunday, the government's coronavirus dashboard said that, as of 09:00 BST, there had been a further 22,961 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 502,978. Another 33 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Sunday. In full: Andrew Marr's interview with Boris Johnson Ministers have 'lost control of virus' - Starmer Public Health England's interim chief executive Michael Brodie said a ""technical issue"" was identified overnight on Friday, 2 October in the process that transfers Covid-19 positive lab results into reporting dashboards. He said the majority of the unreported cases had occurred in the ""most recent days"". It was caused by some data files reporting positive test results exceeding the maximum file size. Mr Brodie said they worked with NHS Test and Trace to ""quickly resolve the issue and transferred all outstanding cases immediately into the NHS Test and Trace contact tracing system"". ""We fully understand the concern this may cause and further robust measures have been put in place as a result,"" he said. Test and Trace and Public Health England joint medical adviser Susan Hopkins said a thorough risk assessment had been undertaken ""to ensure outstanding cases were prioritised for contact tracing effectively"". PHE said NHS Test and Trace have made sure there are enough contact tracers working, and are working with local teams to ensure they also have sufficient resources to be urgently able to contact all cases. The number of call attempts is being increased from 10 to 15 over 96 hours. There have been clear problems with the government's Test and Trace data, but they do not change our view of the UK's trajectory. Cases surged at the beginning of September, they may still be climbing, but not as quicklyas anticipated just a few weeks ago. This perspective comes from three key sets of data - the Office for National Statistics, the React study by Imperial College London and the Covid symptom tracker app. None are blighted by either the current issues with the Test and Trace data or by people struggling to access a test. The real fallout of the weekend's statistical chaos is not the numbers, but the people who should have been contact-traced, told to quarantine and instead may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This is shambolic and people across the country will be understandably alarmed."" He called for Health Secretary Matt Hancock to explain ""what on earth has happened"" and what he plans to do to fix test and trace. Mr Hancock is due to update MPs about coronavirus on Monday afternoon. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, told BBC Breakfast she wanted to know whether it had had ""any impact on government decision making around local restrictions"".

SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? PHE data shows Manchester now has the highest rate of infection in England, at 495.6 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 1 October, from 223.2 the week before. Liverpool has the second highest rate, up to 456.4 from 287.1 per 100,000. Knowsley in Merseyside, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds and Sheffield have also seen sharp rises. News of the glitch in the daily count first emerged late on Saturday, when the UK announced more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the first time since mass testing began. From 25 Sept to 2 Oct 50,786Cases initially reported by PHE 15,841Unreported cases, missed due to IT error 8 daysof incomplete data 1,980cases per day, on average,  were missed in that time 48 hoursIdeal time limit for tracing contacts after  positive test The government said the technical issue meant some cases during the week were not recorded at the time, so were included in Saturday's data. The daily total rose from 4,044 on Monday to a then-high of 7,143 on Tuesday. However, over the next four days the daily total remained stable at a time when continued increases might have been expected. Then came the big leap in numbers - a far bigger day-on-day increase than at any time in the entire pandemic - which was announced on Saturday, five hours later than usual, and was accompanied by the government explanation.

"The Royal Opera House is to sell a David Hockney portrait of its former boss in a bid to raise money to plug a shortfall caused by the pandemic. The painting of Sir David Webster will be auctioned at Christie's this month and is expected to fetch up to Â£18m. Current chief executive Alex Beard said it was ""tough call"" to sell the picture, but there was no alternative if the organisation was to survive. ""We have to face the situation we are in... and get through this,"" he said. The London venue, home of international opera and the Royal Ballet, is the UK's biggest arts employer. It says it has lost Â£3 in every Â£5 of its income since the national lockdown forced it to close its doors in March. The sale of the Hockney portrait is part of a four-pronged plan to help the venue balance the books. There will also be significant redundancies and a fundraising appeal for public donations. In addition, the opera house has applied for a loan to the government's culture recovery fund. BBC to broadcast Royal Opera House reopening Arts industry welcomes Â£1.57bn support package Lloyd Webber says arts are at 'point of no return' ""We knew we had to look at any assets we had,"" said Mr Beard. ""And there is only really one of any note that stands out and that is this portrait."" ""If we can remain viable and get through this, then we can get back to employing people in the future."" Sir David Webster ran the Royal Opera House between 1945 and 1970 and played a key role in the establishment of the Royal Ballet and Royal Opera companies at Covent Garden. Hockney was commissioned to paint his portrait - which in recent years hung in the Covent Garden venue - after he stepped down in the 1970s. It depicts Sir David sitting in profile, in front of a glass-topped coffee table and a vase of pink tulips. According to the Christie's catalogue, the picture was ""the first of a rare handful of commissions completed by Hockney: he would not accept another until three decades later, when he painted Sir George and Lady Mary Christie of Glyndebourne for the National Portrait Gallery"". Mr Beard said the artist had been notified of the impending sale: ""We have a good relationship, but he does not much like it when any of his work is auctioned,""he told the Observer,external. The Royal Opera House reopened in June with a concert which was broadcast on TV, radio and online - but without a live audience. At the time, Mr Beard said the venue, in common with many theatres and arts venues, was facing ""unprecedented financial stress"". Mr Beard was understood to have taken ""a significant reduction"" in pay, while music director Sir Antonio Pappano waived his salary during lockdown. Last week, the Royal Opera House announced a limited return of public performances of ballet and opera, in front of a reduced audience, beginning later this month. Among the productions it is hoping to stage is The Nutcracker, a traditional part of its Christmas programme since 1984.

United were humbled, humiliated and hammered on their own turf by the returning Jose Mourinho as Spurswon 6-1. And then just hours later Aston Villa incredibly went one better, a 7-2 win leaving Liverpool as the laughing stock of the league for once.

FT: Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham Robbie SavageEx-Wales midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Tottenham were absolutely magnificent - organisation, desire, aggression with and without the ball, clinical in forward areas, every player was a 9/10. They were absolutely sensational. It was one of the best performances I've seen at Old Trafford. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) It is the perfect result for Utd as to cover up the cracks with a narrow defeat wouldn't do justice to show the deficiencies in this squad- it may force Utd to buy players tomorrow that they wouldn't have done had they drawn or lost this by narrow margin. Matt Radlett Problem with this is all tomorrow's talk will be about Man Utd. Can we stop treating them as a huge now. OK obviously off the pitch massive, but on the pitch mediocre at best. Anon #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Chris Hossell:Woodward and the United board are a huge problem don't get me wrong but I'm fairly sure any other manager in the league could extract more fight and a better performance out of the current crop of players. Solskjaer has to go. Steve Rossiter:This is what you get for years of mismanagement top down to bottom. A manager that isnât up to it, a squad thatâs not capable, the club run as a way of providing money to the Glazers only. Never mind top 4, it could be a close thing to stay up FT: Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham Ian DennisBBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter The fact that are United are scrambling around to sign players before the deadline tomorrow is the perfect illustration of everything that is wrong with Manchester United. How can a team of that stature be in this position within 24 hours of the deadline? Where is the planning? Where is the strategy? Where is the direction that they are going? The fact they've only added Donny van de Beek, and yes they may add to that, but Edinson Cavani still smacks of desperation. The questions remain about their recruitment policy regardless of how many players they bring in tomorrow. A club like Manchester United shouldn't do their business within 24 hours of the deadline. Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra on Sky Sports: ""Every team against Manchester United looks like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich. I really don't want to laugh right now - I'm really angry."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) ""Siri, how should I open my Premier League account""....
Watkins - ""Perfect Hat-trick vs the defending champions in the first half"" George, Marylebone Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham Manchester United Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville on Sky Sports:""I can't believe we are where we are. There's no excuse for those players on that pitch because they were absolutely pathetic. Spineless in that second half. ""I think these players expected to get help [in the transfer window] but they've not helped themselves. ""City and Liverpool pulled away psychologically before the season even started."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) I'm a Liverpool fan but football at the moment is just bonkers!!! I love it!! More of this total smorgasbord of oddity! Well done Villa! Glen, Manchester. Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Clinton MorrisonFormer Crystal Palace striker on BBC Radio 5 Live This is a shock result, it's a huge result. Nobody would have predicted this score. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK Only) Abid: At the start of the season I thought Man City would win the league. After their poor start I wondered if perhaps Liverpool will reclaim their title. Now I genuinely don't know who seem like favourites. Insane day in the Premier League. Greg: People mention the empty stadiums and while I do think they have an effect on these crazy scorelines, I think the lack of a proper preseason is having much more of an effect on these results! Players don't seem fully fit or know their systems well enough. Glen Naylor:Imagine at the start of the day you were told there would be a 6-1 and a 7-2 and the losing sides in those games would be Man Utd and Liverpool. What a crazy day of Premier League football.   WHAT a day in the Premier League. No, I'm not making these scorelines up. Catch up on the reports: Aston Villa [SEVEN] 7-2 Liverpool Aston Villa Aston Villa manger Dean Smith talking to Sky Sports:""It was just sheer hard work and effort. The work ethic, when Jurgen Klopp says wow to you you know you've done something right. The lads were superb, they executed the game plan perfectly. We were at our best today. ""The biggest regret is that there were no supporters here with us - I hope they are enjoying it from their homes. It was a tremendous achievement for the players, they worked really hard. ""If you get outworked by Liverpool, they beat you because they've got fabulous talent. Even at 5-2 you're not sure if that's enough because of how good they are. We felt that if we reversed the ball to the opposite side, that's where the space would be. Football is small margins, they had some good chances in the first half where our keeper made a couple of good saves and that, alongside a couple of deflections, was the difference probably."" On Ollie Watkins:""He is a tremendous talent, I felt we've learnt a lot of lessons from last season and we've added quality to what we thought was a good talented squad anyway."" On their start to the season:""It's a good start, an exceptional result and a really good start. We won't get complacent but we'll enjoy tonight because results like that don't come around too often. We've got a lot of pride and confidence going into the international break."" Aston Villa [SEVEN] 7-2 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp talking to Sky Sports:""Explain I'm not sure, but I can tell you what I saw. For different reasons, Aston Villa did really well, forced all the mistakes that we made. The game had a specific direction - the first goal had an impact but it shouldn't. We conceded goals like that in the past, but the reaction wasn't good, and we lost the plot. ""Our creating in the last third was really good - we didn't score but it was really good. Every time Villa won the ball they counter-attacked and our attempts to stop it were below average. We changed the system slightly at half-time to make it easier for the boys maybe. We had good moments, but our good moments led to nothing but their good moments always led to a big chance or a goal and that makes a difference. All the things you should not do in a football game, we did tonight, but all the credit to Aston Villa they forced us to do it."" Why did you lose the plot?""It was unexpected but it happened tonight. For me it wasn't a specific moment, we put all our rubbish things and mistakes in one game and hopefully we can start again. Tonight wasn't sloppy, it was just bad, I have to admit that but I can't change it. I would love to have a training session tomorrow and Tuesday and to talk about it but the boys go back off to international duty. Hopefully they come back healthy and we use the two days to prepare for Everton."" Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Liverpool More from Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: ""Aston Villa were so good. [Ollie] Watkins wow and of course when you
give the ball to Jack [Grealish] in a one v one situation on the left he can go either way
and create chances. ""Who wants to lose 7-2? Years ago we told ourselves we
wanted to create history. That was history but obviously the wrong type."" On the length of Alissonâs
absence:""Itâs long. Too long for the next few games for sure. It looks like
a few weeks but we will see."" Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC Sport:""Yes [I can
believe it] I saw it. So it is easy to believe because I was here. First of all
you have to say that Villa did very well. They were very physical, very smart
and very direct, we were not. âWe had big chances which we did not use, but when you concede seven
Iâm not sure you can say it would have been 7-7. We made too many mistakes and
massive ones obviously. It started with the first goal and around the goals we
made massive mistakes. ""We lost balls in the wrong area and did not protect
properly. It looked like we lost the
plot after it went to 1-0. It is not an excuse. Normally you can be 1-0 down
and do the stuff you want to do. We created but did not protect ourselves
properly so each ball we lost was a massive counter attack. ""That is why we conceded and three goals were deflected. Itâs
unlucky but it is not a coincidence because it means it was not a proper block.
There is nobody to blame apart from me and us.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Aston Villa Aston Villa manager Dean Smith speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""Liverpool have got a great record at Villa Park, one of my
first games was watching them win 5-0 here. We never dreamed of getting a
result like this today. ""The performance was outstanding from start to finish.
We created an awful lot of chances against an exceptional defence and team. We
had to work very hard. ""We have carried on the momentum from the end of last season
but we have added quality to that. People have questioned Ollie Watkinsâ price.
That has probably trebled now. He has hit the bar when he had a really good chance and Ross
Barkley had two or three good chances as well. ""Football is about small margins
and our goalkeeper had to make a couple of good saves when it was 1-0 or 2-0."" On Barkley giving Villa a new dimension:âHe does. We tweaked
our system and had two holders in Douglas Luiz and John McGinn and freed up Ross as
a 10 and tried to keep them down one side. ""We wanted to make sure we were good behind the ball and we
executed the gameplan expertly. ""You donât very often get a performance and result like we
have tonight against the champions. The biggest regret is that there are no
supporters because this place would be rocking."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.004769098
"The difference in rules for Oldham and Manchester has drawn criticism Northern England faces a ""winter of dangerous discontent"" unless the test and trace system improves, the mayor of Greater Manchester has warned. Andy Burnham said the system was the ""first line of defence against the virus"" and the government were ""over-relying"" on restrictions. Extra rules are now in forcefor a growing number of areas in the North. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Boris Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if the restrictions were working. The prime minister said: ""The advice that we're getting is that, in these areas where we have got stringent local lockdowns, we need to wait and see whether the R [infection rate] starts to come down because some of these things have been intensified [â¦] just in the last few days."" Andy Burnham has warned of a widening north-south divide Mr Burnham said: ""If there are to be local restrictions, they must come with local control of test and trace, a local furlough scheme, and support for our councils and businesses. ""Put it under local control because the government are using call centres to try and contact people, but we will put boots on the ground and I am absolutely certain that that approach will be more successful."" He also urged the government to consult more with local authorities and clarify rules for neighbouring areas, which he said were ""inconsistent"". In Greater Manchester,funerals are limited to 30 people,external, except Oldham, where they are restricted to 20 people sincefurther rules were enforced in Augustto curb the spread of coronavirus. However, the rate of cases has recently risen to 336 per 100,000 people in Manchester, while dropping to 177 per 100,000 in Oldham. Boris Johnson was speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show The prime minister said he ""understands people's frustrations"", adding: ""No one has come up with any better proposals that I am aware of."" Mr Burnham also voiced concern the North West would be ""levelled down by not just the virus but by the government's failure to support us"". ""It was frankly unforgiveable that businesses in Bolton were closed down without the people working given support with their wages. That is going to cause massive damage if that approach continues. ""This could be a winter of dangerous discontent here in the north of England and I think the prime minister needs to wake up to that. ""I think there's a very real and present danger that Covid-19 is going to widen the north-south divide because we are heading into a winter where the north of England is under restrictions unlike the south.""

"Kenzo was known for his love of graphics and bright colours The Japanese founder of popular fashion brand Kenzo has died aged 81, from complications linked to coronavirus. Tributes have poured in from all across the world for Kenzo Takada who died at the American Hospital in Paris. Known for his bright graphics, jungle inspired prints and eclectic use of colour, he was the first Japanese designer to gain prominence on the Paris fashion scene. He settled in France in the 1960s and spent the rest of his career there. With his ""nearly 8,000 designs"", the Japanese designer ""never stopped celebrating fashion and the art of living"", his spokesman said. Paris MayorAnne Hidalgo paid tribute to him on Twitter,external: ""Designer of immense talent, he had given colour and light their place in fashion. Paris is now mourning one of its sons."" ""I was a fan of the brand in the 1970s when he started. I think he was a great designer,""fashion news website WWD.com quoted Sidney Toledano,external, CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH which owns the Kenzo brand, as saying. The rebirth of Japanese design Many Japanese Twitter users posted their condolences on the platform, some of whom shared that their first ever luxury product was one from Kenzo. ""The first wallet I ever owned was from Kenzo,"" said one Twitter user. ""Even though it's a small thing - I'll always remember it. Rest in Peace."" ""I have a Kenzo [outfit] passed down from my mum,"" said another. ""I still wear it."" Many others said they owned Kenzo handkerchiefs - an accessory which is still popular in Japan. Born in 1939 in Himeji, near the city of Osaka, Kenzo Takada decided to make his way by boat to Paris in 1965, despite hardly speaking any French. At first he sold sketches to fashion houses but later decided to strike it out on his own, with a small store called Jungle Jap. ""I decorated the shop myself with little money,""Takada told the South China Morning Post newspaper recently,external, in what was one of his last media interviews. ""One of the first paintings I saw in Paris and fell in love with was a jungle painting... and that was the inspiration for the shop."" His clothes were heavily influenced by Japanese designs. Takada said he didn't want to ""do what French designers were doing"". ""His native Japan remained [the] source of inspiration for every collection he did. He kept the use of vibrant colours and volumes present at all times,"" said Circe Henestrosa, head of the school of fashion at Singapore's Lasalle College of the Arts. ""I think he was ahead of his time and was one of the first designers to experiment with the idea of genderless fashion. He would never conform to the stereotypical idea of masculine and feminine fashion,"" said Ms Henestrosa. Kenzo Takada during his autumn-winter 1983-1984 fashion show in Paris Takada's ""big break"" finally came when fashion magazine Elle put one of his looks on their cover, and when international fashion magazine editors attended his fashion show in 1971, he told SCMP. There was controversy over the brand initially, as Takada had called himself and his label ""Jap"" - a term that some in the United States found offensive, which he discovered when he started reaching out to the American market. ""I knew it had a pejorative meaning,""he told the New York Times in a 1972 interview.,external""But I thought if I did something good, I would change the meaning."" Takada rechristened the label with his first name - and thus Kenzo the brand was born. It flourished and became an internationally known fashion label, adding a menswear line in 1983 and then more casual sportswear lines Kenzo Jeans and Kenzo Jungle. Kenzo fragrances and eyewear soon followed. Then, at the height of the brand's success in the 1990s, Takada sold it to LVMH. ""The hardest year of my life was 1990, when my life partner Xavier died and my business partner had a stroke,"" he told SCMP. ""That's why I sold the company to LVMH [in 1993]. I felt I couldn't do it on my own."" He stayed at the label for a few years and retired from fashion in 1999 at the age of 60. But even in his retirement he remained active creatively, designing costumes for opera productions and taking up painting. ""He was supposed to be in Paris only for two years [but] spent the rest of his life there. He took Paris by storm,"" said Ms Henestrosa. ""As [fashion journalist] Suzy Menkes said, 'he wanted to make happy clothes'. His work was avant-garde... it is sad when creative minds like Kenzo leave this world.""

" By Myriam Lahouari Minutes earlier, three of them had tried to wrench open the apartment door. But it was too swollen by the heat of the fire. So the brothers, three and 10 years old, are trapped. They are crying at a window, 15m (49 feet) up, choking on thick black smoke billowing behind them. To their left, flames rage from a carpet draped over a balcony railing. Their apartment is in La Villeneuve, a French modernist suburb once heralded as a social utopia, but which has since suffered decades of stigma and neglect. Hechmi, Walid, and Lucas - the men who tried to force the boys’ door - have run back down the tower block stairs to join four others outside. They are Elyasse, Guelord, Mouhsine and Bilal. None of the men knows each other. The suburb in Grenoble, south-eastern France, is home to several thousand people - a town within a town. A crowd is looking on, panicked by the scene unfolding before them. Mouhsine asks if anyone knows the name of the eldest boy. “Sofiane,” someone replies. The men call up to Sofiane, telling him that he and his brother have to jump. Guelord shouts that the younger boy needs to go first. Sofiane should throw him down. The 10-year-old hesitates. He looks at the ground. Behind him the smoke has thickened; the balcony is burning even more fiercely. “It’s better to break an arm or a hand than to burn at home,” Hechmi shouts up. Sofiane grabs his brother, Soleiman, and dangles him by his T-shirt out of the window. But he doesn’t immediately let go. He’s looking down, seeing if the men are ready. “He held him for a few seconds in the air - he wanted to make sure that his brother would land in our arms,” recounts Elyasse. Sofiane drops Soleiman. The onlookers scream. The three-year-old, crashing through the air like ""a cannonball"", according to Elyasse, bangs his foot against a windowsill which flips him, so that he is now plummeting head first. Mouhsine manages to catch him with the help of his chest, Hechmi with his shoulders. Behind, Bilal helps Mouhsine brace against the impact. The three men collapse to the ground. Mouhsine Sbiti Mouhsine Sbiti Guelord Musumar Guelord Musumar Lucas Reizmives Lucas Reizmives Walid Athoumani Walid Athoumani Hechmi Selmi Hechmi Selmi Elyasse Ben Taleb Elyasse Ben Taleb Bilal Bilal Mouhsine Sbiti Mouhsine Sbiti Guelord Musumar Guelord Musumar Lucas Reizmives Lucas Reizmives Walid Athoumani Walid Athoumani Hechmi Selmi Hechmi Selmi Elyasse Ben Taleb Elyasse Ben Taleb Bilal Bilal The men started out on 21 July as strangers, even though most live in or close to Arlequin, a neighbourhood in La Villeneuve known for its multicoloured tenements. Mouhsine Sbiti had moved from Morocco just one month earlier to an apartment 200m from the burning building - Arlequin’s tower 54. He was on his way to the supermarket when he heard screams. Guelord Musumar, a special-needs teacher from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who lives near La Villeneuve, was on his way to the tower block to meet his father-in-law for lunch when he saw the commotion. The two youngest men, Lucas Reizmives and Walid Athoumani, saw the flames from their neighbouring apartment blocks. Walid, a 25-year-old student from the Comoros, sprinted into the lift of tower 54. He was joined at the children’s door by Lucas, a 19-year-old Romanian construction worker, who had hurtled up the stairs. Hechmi Selmi, originally from Tunisia, had been photocopying documents in Arlequin’s social centre. He came outside to find the temperature had soared in the midday sun. Lifting his head to swig from a bottle of water, he saw the smoke out the corner of his eye. Elyasse Ben Taleb, an Algerian lift technician, had been carrying out checks in Arlequin and was rounding the corner of the block for his last appointment before lunch when he drove past the commotion, stopped the car, and ran back. Now, just minutes after gathering at the foot of the tower block, they are holding Soleiman. ""It's like a vehicle falling into your arms… I felt a terrible pain,"" recounts Elyasse. But they have done it - the boy is safe. It’s Hechmi who gets up with the three-year-old, and as he lifts him up, he feels his back cracking. He is too injured to help with the second rescue. The other six get back into position. Ten-year-old Sofiane is much bigger and heavier than his brother. Mouhsine, a former security forces officer with the Royal Palace in Rabat, looks up and tries to estimate. About 40 kilos, he guesses. He knows the force will be much more difficult to absorb. Guelord is to his right, strong enough, Mouhsine reckons, that between them they can lock together to brace against the impact. He grabs the 29-year-old’s arm. The men are worried - they can’t see Sofiane. But he soon reappears through the thickening smoke. He climbs through the open window to sit on the sill. His feet dangle over the edge, and he looks down at the ground. The men wait. It seems like an eternity but it's only a few seconds. Finally, he levers himself over the windowsill, hangs, then lets go. His right foot strikes Mouhsine, his left foot Guelord. Both fall under the impact. Mouhsine screams in pain. The bone in his wrist looks deformed. Guelord realises he has broken his thumb. Walid has fractured his wrist, Lucas his hand. Bilal is thought to have broken a finger. But Sofiane is unharmed. “He landed directly into our arms,” says Walid.  Elyasse weeps in relief. “The two children were unscathed - it’s a miracle,” he reflects. ""We didn't have much time to discuss and decide, everything was done by instinct,"" adds Mouhsine. Souhaila Saidi / EVN Souhaila Saidi / EVN “L’acte heroique,” proclaimed Grenoble’s newspaper Le Dauphine Libere. The story was carried by national and international media, brought to life by dramatic mobile-phone footage. But the euphoric headlines could not convey a striking detail. The boys were saved by a group of immigrants on the very same estate that erupted - almost 10 years previously to the day - in violent rioting, prompting an excoriating anti-immigration speech by then French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In the summer of 2010, a man from La Villeneuve was suspected of stealing from a local casino, and was killed in the police shoot-out that followed. His death triggered three nights of looting and arson in the area. A few days later Sarkozy made a hard-hitting and widely criticised security speech in Grenoble. “We are seeing the consequences of 50 years of insufficiently controlled immigration, which have ended in the failure of integration,” he said. “We are so proud of our integration system. Perhaps we need to wake up? To see what it has produced. It worked. It doesn't work any more.” He called for foreign-born residents threatening the police to be stripped of their citizenship. Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Two years later, La Villeneuve hit the headlines again when a group of youths from the estate brutally murdered Kevin Noubissi and his friend Sofiane Tadbirt in a neighbouring suburb. The attack was reported to be revenge for an altercation between Noubissi’s younger brother and another teenager. March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 The area has not crashed into the headlines for such violence since, but La Villeneuve is nevertheless seen as a place “that sucks”, according to local journalist Benjamin Bultel. Its buildings have been poorly maintained; its schools have a bad reputation, he says. This is a world away from how it was envisaged. La Villeneuve, or “new city”, was actually a neighbourhood born of high ideals. It was built in the 1970s to create a community that would be different from other more ghettoised French suburbs. The development, which has a 14-hectare wooded park, large lake, and a view of the mountains, sought to attract residents from a mix of social backgrounds. The neighbourhood was designed to be self-sufficient, with its own schools, shops and other services. Residents have spoken fondly of how sociable and ground-breaking the development was at first, with skating on the lake in the winter, doors left unlocked, and anenlightened education system. Grenoble urban planner Maïlys Toussaint says the project attracted a wide range of residents in the early days and became home to people who wanted to rebuild their lives; economic and political immigrants; or residents of a city-centre district under renovation. “The children found a huge playground, the residents ate meals with their neighbours in the walkways... there was even a neighbourhood television station run by the residents.” But experts say reality failed to live up to the dream, and after only a few years the vast majority of the middle classes moved away. And then in 1983 the housing policy was changed to prioritise those on low incomes, changing the social blend. ""Many people blame the deterioration of La Villeneuve and Arlequin on the municipality elected in 1983 and its political choices,” says Toussaint. “It's a project that would have required support and there was none.” Bultel, a reporter with La Villeneuve’s Le Crieur newspaper and a current resident, says it has never recovered from the violence of 2010, despite residents trying various initiatives to change its image. Toussaint, who lived in the suburb when she was a student, says her first-hand experience challenged her preconceptions. ""I had seen La Villeneuve on the TV news at the time of the riots, and had been afraid of this neighbourhood without even knowing it. But I ended up settling there a few years later. You have to go beyond clichés and try to understand what is really going on there. This stigmatisation is a real suffering for the residents,"" she says. She says current renovation works in La Villeneuve’s Arlequin district are designed to try to lure back the middle classes. Bultel says the address is so stigmatised that its young residents struggle to get a job, or even an internship. He stresses, though, that there are many positive aspects to the suburb. Social ties are stronger in the area than in the city centre, he argues, with some families having lived there for generations. “During the lockdown, neighbours shared food, internet connections, information about the pandemic… people made face masks for their neighbours, young people did shopping for the elderly... “Some Arlequin people set up a choir and sang on their balcony every evening at 6pm.” Mouhsine says La Villeneuve’s reputation is unjustified. ""We're not going to deny that there are a lot of problems in Villeneuve, but there are also great human values, such as solidarity,"" he says. Grenoble mayor Eric Piolle acknowledged this community spirit in a post about the rescue on hisFacebook page. “Hand in hand, they allowed the two little ones to get out of this tragedy unscathed. Faithful to the tradition of… mutual aid in Grenoble, particularly strong in La Villeneuve all year round, as we have seen during lockdown… it is together they were able to rescue the children,” he wrote. Ten days after the fire, Piolle presented the seven men injured in the rescue effort with medals of honour at City Hall. But only six of them had their identities inscribed on their medals. Bilal’s name was left off. The Algerian, who is reported to have fled the rescue scene when the fire service arrived, is an undocumented migrant. According to French media he arrived in France in 2018, and has been sleeping on friends’ floors doing odd jobs. He hopes to get the necessary paperwork to live and work legally,reports say. Eric Piolle also awarded a collective medal to other residents who were uninjured in the rescue but nevertheless helped,or tried to do so. One of those given the collective medal was Algerian Malika Kredimi. She had been on her way home from the pharmacy when she spotted the drama unfolding and, as a good friend of the family, took the children home for a bath and change of clothes. She says they were covered head-to-toe in soot. The boys were then taken to hospital to check for smoke inhalation, and an investigation was launched into why their parents had left them locked in their apartment alone. According to Grenoble public prosecutors, the father left to go to work at 1130. The children’s mother, Rachida, had not yet returned from a shopping trip. Rachida was filmed giving an emotional speech at themedal ceremony. “Some say that the Villeneuve district is not good... I will never forget what these people did for my children. The people of the neighbourhood have not let us down. I don't know if there is solidarity like this in other neighbourhoods,” she said. But the way in which City Hall rewarded those involved has not been without controversy. Some in the wider crowd feel others should have been given more recognition. Bultel says dozens of residents were involved in the rescue effort, with activities ranging from trying to reach the children via another balcony to directing the fire brigade to the scene. The injuries of the seven who caught the boys were in some cases severe, and some of the men required surgery. And most have needed support from a psychologist, organised by a national victim support organisation and Grenoble City Council. Elyasse, a father of three who left Algeria 20 years ago during the civil war, says he still has flashbacks to that day in July.  ""The children are shouting, the smoke, the flames, it keeps coming back. As soon as I see or smell smoke, I am immediately transported back to these scenes."" Mouhsine says he is so traumatised that he is thinking of leaving the neighbourhood. ""I can't forget the faces of these two kids, I... have nightmares about them,"" he says. Malika’s seven-year-old son, Salah, who watched the rescue with his mother, also has bad dreams. He can’t understand why his friend, Sofiane, threw his little brother out of the window. The rescuers have not seen the children again, but Arlequin’s social centre is planning a reunion as soon as Sofiane, the older boy, feels ready. ""Keeping calm, keeping his little brother in a safe place, calling for help, not panicking, dealing with the situation - it was incredible. Even an adult couldn't have done better,"" Elyasse says. ""They call us heroes. But for all of us, the real hero is the big brother.”  Writer: Myriam Lahouari Editor: Sarah Buckley Illustrations: George Wafula Photography: Pierre Bascugnana Graphics: Debie Loizou Video: Souhaila Saidi / EVN Additional images: Getty Images, Mouhsine Sbiti, Guelord Musumar, Lucas Reizmives, Walid Athoumani, Hechmi Selmi, Elyasse Ben Taleb, Malika Kredimi, Thierry Chenu - Grenoble City Council Online Production: James Percy Published: October 2020",Positive,0.99999475

FT: Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham Robbie SavageEx-Wales midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Tottenham were absolutely magnificent - organisation, desire, aggression with and without the ball, clinical in forward areas, every player was a 9/10. They were absolutely sensational. It was one of the best performances I've seen at Old Trafford. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) It is the perfect result for Utd as to cover up the cracks with a narrow defeat wouldn't do justice to show the deficiencies in this squad- it may force Utd to buy players tomorrow that they wouldn't have done had they drawn or lost this by narrow margin. Matt Radlett Problem with this is all tomorrow's talk will be about Man Utd. Can we stop treating them as a huge now. OK obviously off the pitch massive, but on the pitch mediocre at best. Anon #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Chris Hossell:Woodward and the United board are a huge problem don't get me wrong but I'm fairly sure any other manager in the league could extract more fight and a better performance out of the current crop of players. Solskjaer has to go. Steve Rossiter:This is what you get for years of mismanagement top down to bottom. A manager that isnât up to it, a squad thatâs not capable, the club run as a way of providing money to the Glazers only. Never mind top 4, it could be a close thing to stay up FT: Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham Ian DennisBBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter The fact that are United are scrambling around to sign players before the deadline tomorrow is the perfect illustration of everything that is wrong with Manchester United. How can a team of that stature be in this position within 24 hours of the deadline? Where is the planning? Where is the strategy? Where is the direction that they are going? The fact they've only added Donny van de Beek, and yes they may add to that, but Edinson Cavani still smacks of desperation. The questions remain about their recruitment policy regardless of how many players they bring in tomorrow. A club like Manchester United shouldn't do their business within 24 hours of the deadline. Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra on Sky Sports: ""Every team against Manchester United looks like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich. I really don't want to laugh right now - I'm really angry."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) ""Siri, how should I open my Premier League account""....
Watkins - ""Perfect Hat-trick vs the defending champions in the first half"" George, Marylebone Manchester United 1-6 Tottenham Manchester United Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville on Sky Sports:""I can't believe we are where we are. There's no excuse for those players on that pitch because they were absolutely pathetic. Spineless in that second half. ""I think these players expected to get help [in the transfer window] but they've not helped themselves. ""City and Liverpool pulled away psychologically before the season even started."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) I'm a Liverpool fan but football at the moment is just bonkers!!! I love it!! More of this total smorgasbord of oddity! Well done Villa! Glen, Manchester. Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Clinton MorrisonFormer Crystal Palace striker on BBC Radio 5 Live This is a shock result, it's a huge result. Nobody would have predicted this score. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK Only) Abid: At the start of the season I thought Man City would win the league. After their poor start I wondered if perhaps Liverpool will reclaim their title. Now I genuinely don't know who seem like favourites. Insane day in the Premier League. Greg: People mention the empty stadiums and while I do think they have an effect on these crazy scorelines, I think the lack of a proper preseason is having much more of an effect on these results! Players don't seem fully fit or know their systems well enough. Glen Naylor:Imagine at the start of the day you were told there would be a 6-1 and a 7-2 and the losing sides in those games would be Man Utd and Liverpool. What a crazy day of Premier League football.   WHAT a day in the Premier League. No, I'm not making these scorelines up. Catch up on the reports: Aston Villa [SEVEN] 7-2 Liverpool Aston Villa Aston Villa manger Dean Smith talking to Sky Sports:""It was just sheer hard work and effort. The work ethic, when Jurgen Klopp says wow to you you know you've done something right. The lads were superb, they executed the game plan perfectly. We were at our best today. ""The biggest regret is that there were no supporters here with us - I hope they are enjoying it from their homes. It was a tremendous achievement for the players, they worked really hard. ""If you get outworked by Liverpool, they beat you because they've got fabulous talent. Even at 5-2 you're not sure if that's enough because of how good they are. We felt that if we reversed the ball to the opposite side, that's where the space would be. Football is small margins, they had some good chances in the first half where our keeper made a couple of good saves and that, alongside a couple of deflections, was the difference probably."" On Ollie Watkins:""He is a tremendous talent, I felt we've learnt a lot of lessons from last season and we've added quality to what we thought was a good talented squad anyway."" On their start to the season:""It's a good start, an exceptional result and a really good start. We won't get complacent but we'll enjoy tonight because results like that don't come around too often. We've got a lot of pride and confidence going into the international break."" Aston Villa [SEVEN] 7-2 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp talking to Sky Sports:""Explain I'm not sure, but I can tell you what I saw. For different reasons, Aston Villa did really well, forced all the mistakes that we made. The game had a specific direction - the first goal had an impact but it shouldn't. We conceded goals like that in the past, but the reaction wasn't good, and we lost the plot. ""Our creating in the last third was really good - we didn't score but it was really good. Every time Villa won the ball they counter-attacked and our attempts to stop it were below average. We changed the system slightly at half-time to make it easier for the boys maybe. We had good moments, but our good moments led to nothing but their good moments always led to a big chance or a goal and that makes a difference. All the things you should not do in a football game, we did tonight, but all the credit to Aston Villa they forced us to do it."" Why did you lose the plot?""It was unexpected but it happened tonight. For me it wasn't a specific moment, we put all our rubbish things and mistakes in one game and hopefully we can start again. Tonight wasn't sloppy, it was just bad, I have to admit that but I can't change it. I would love to have a training session tomorrow and Tuesday and to talk about it but the boys go back off to international duty. Hopefully they come back healthy and we use the two days to prepare for Everton."" Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Liverpool More from Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC Sport: ""Aston Villa were so good. [Ollie] Watkins wow and of course when you
give the ball to Jack [Grealish] in a one v one situation on the left he can go either way
and create chances. ""Who wants to lose 7-2? Years ago we told ourselves we
wanted to create history. That was history but obviously the wrong type."" On the length of Alissonâs
absence:""Itâs long. Too long for the next few games for sure. It looks like
a few weeks but we will see."" Aston Villa 7 (SEVEN)-2 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp speaking to BBC Sport:""Yes [I can
believe it] I saw it. So it is easy to believe because I was here. First of all
you have to say that Villa did very well. They were very physical, very smart
and very direct, we were not. âWe had big chances which we did not use, but when you concede seven
Iâm not sure you can say it would have been 7-7. We made too many mistakes and
massive ones obviously. It started with the first goal and around the goals we
made massive mistakes. ""We lost balls in the wrong area and did not protect
properly. It looked like we lost the
plot after it went to 1-0. It is not an excuse. Normally you can be 1-0 down
and do the stuff you want to do. We created but did not protect ourselves
properly so each ball we lost was a massive counter attack. ""That is why we conceded and three goals were deflected. Itâs
unlucky but it is not a coincidence because it means it was not a proper block.
There is nobody to blame apart from me and us.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

first games was watching them win 5-0 here. We never dreamed of getting a
result like this today. ""The performance was outstanding from start to finish.
We created an awful lot of chances against an exceptional defence and team. We
had to work very hard. ""We have carried on the momentum from the end of last season

That has probably trebled now. He has hit the bar when he had a really good chance and Ross
Barkley had two or three good chances as well. ""Football is about small margins

our system and had two holders in Douglas Luiz and John McGinn and freed up Ross as
a 10 and tried to keep them down one side. ""We wanted to make sure we were good behind the ball and we

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

" By Myriam Lahouari Minutes earlier, three of them had tried to wrench open the apartment door. But it was too swollen by the heat of the fire. So the brothers, three and 10 years old, are trapped. They are crying at a window, 15m (49 feet) up, choking on thick black smoke billowing behind them. To their left, flames rage from a carpet draped over a balcony railing. Their apartment is in La Villeneuve, a French modernist suburb once heralded as a social utopia, but which has since suffered decades of stigma and neglect. Hechmi, Walid, and Lucas - the men who tried to force the boys’ door - have run back down the tower block stairs to join four others outside. They are Elyasse, Guelord, Mouhsine and Bilal. None of the men knows each other. The suburb in Grenoble, south-eastern France, is home to several thousand people - a town within a town. A crowd is looking on, panicked by the scene unfolding before them. Mouhsine asks if anyone knows the name of the eldest boy. “Sofiane,” someone replies. The men call up to Sofiane, telling him that he and his brother have to jump. Guelord shouts that the younger boy needs to go first. Sofiane should throw him down. The 10-year-old hesitates. He looks at the ground. Behind him the smoke has thickened; the balcony is burning even more fiercely. “It’s better to break an arm or a hand than to burn at home,” Hechmi shouts up. Sofiane grabs his brother, Soleiman, and dangles him by his T-shirt out of the window. But he doesn’t immediately let go. He’s looking down, seeing if the men are ready. “He held him for a few seconds in the air - he wanted to make sure that his brother would land in our arms,” recounts Elyasse. Sofiane drops Soleiman. The onlookers scream. The three-year-old, crashing through the air like ""a cannonball"", according to Elyasse, bangs his foot against a windowsill which flips him, so that he is now plummeting head first. Mouhsine manages to catch him with the help of his chest, Hechmi with his shoulders. Behind, Bilal helps Mouhsine brace against the impact. The three men collapse to the ground. Mouhsine Sbiti Mouhsine Sbiti Guelord Musumar Guelord Musumar Lucas Reizmives Lucas Reizmives Walid Athoumani Walid Athoumani Hechmi Selmi Hechmi Selmi Elyasse Ben Taleb Elyasse Ben Taleb Bilal Bilal Mouhsine Sbiti Mouhsine Sbiti Guelord Musumar Guelord Musumar Lucas Reizmives Lucas Reizmives Walid Athoumani Walid Athoumani Hechmi Selmi Hechmi Selmi Elyasse Ben Taleb Elyasse Ben Taleb Bilal Bilal The men started out on 21 July as strangers, even though most live in or close to Arlequin, a neighbourhood in La Villeneuve known for its multicoloured tenements. Mouhsine Sbiti had moved from Morocco just one month earlier to an apartment 200m from the burning building - Arlequin’s tower 54. He was on his way to the supermarket when he heard screams. Guelord Musumar, a special-needs teacher from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who lives near La Villeneuve, was on his way to the tower block to meet his father-in-law for lunch when he saw the commotion. The two youngest men, Lucas Reizmives and Walid Athoumani, saw the flames from their neighbouring apartment blocks. Walid, a 25-year-old student from the Comoros, sprinted into the lift of tower 54. He was joined at the children’s door by Lucas, a 19-year-old Romanian construction worker, who had hurtled up the stairs. Hechmi Selmi, originally from Tunisia, had been photocopying documents in Arlequin’s social centre. He came outside to find the temperature had soared in the midday sun. Lifting his head to swig from a bottle of water, he saw the smoke out the corner of his eye. Elyasse Ben Taleb, an Algerian lift technician, had been carrying out checks in Arlequin and was rounding the corner of the block for his last appointment before lunch when he drove past the commotion, stopped the car, and ran back. Now, just minutes after gathering at the foot of the tower block, they are holding Soleiman. ""It's like a vehicle falling into your arms… I felt a terrible pain,"" recounts Elyasse. But they have done it - the boy is safe. It’s Hechmi who gets up with the three-year-old, and as he lifts him up, he feels his back cracking. He is too injured to help with the second rescue. The other six get back into position. Ten-year-old Sofiane is much bigger and heavier than his brother. Mouhsine, a former security forces officer with the Royal Palace in Rabat, looks up and tries to estimate. About 40 kilos, he guesses. He knows the force will be much more difficult to absorb. Guelord is to his right, strong enough, Mouhsine reckons, that between them they can lock together to brace against the impact. He grabs the 29-year-old’s arm. The men are worried - they can’t see Sofiane. But he soon reappears through the thickening smoke. He climbs through the open window to sit on the sill. His feet dangle over the edge, and he looks down at the ground. The men wait. It seems like an eternity but it's only a few seconds. Finally, he levers himself over the windowsill, hangs, then lets go. His right foot strikes Mouhsine, his left foot Guelord. Both fall under the impact. Mouhsine screams in pain. The bone in his wrist looks deformed. Guelord realises he has broken his thumb. Walid has fractured his wrist, Lucas his hand. Bilal is thought to have broken a finger. But Sofiane is unharmed. “He landed directly into our arms,” says Walid.  Elyasse weeps in relief. “The two children were unscathed - it’s a miracle,” he reflects. ""We didn't have much time to discuss and decide, everything was done by instinct,"" adds Mouhsine. Souhaila Saidi / EVN Souhaila Saidi / EVN “L’acte heroique,” proclaimed Grenoble’s newspaper Le Dauphine Libere. The story was carried by national and international media, brought to life by dramatic mobile-phone footage. But the euphoric headlines could not convey a striking detail. The boys were saved by a group of immigrants on the very same estate that erupted - almost 10 years previously to the day - in violent rioting, prompting an excoriating anti-immigration speech by then French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In the summer of 2010, a man from La Villeneuve was suspected of stealing from a local casino, and was killed in the police shoot-out that followed. His death triggered three nights of looting and arson in the area. A few days later Sarkozy made a hard-hitting and widely criticised security speech in Grenoble. “We are seeing the consequences of 50 years of insufficiently controlled immigration, which have ended in the failure of integration,” he said. “We are so proud of our integration system. Perhaps we need to wake up? To see what it has produced. It worked. It doesn't work any more.” He called for foreign-born residents threatening the police to be stripped of their citizenship. Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Two years later, La Villeneuve hit the headlines again when a group of youths from the estate brutally murdered Kevin Noubissi and his friend Sofiane Tadbirt in a neighbouring suburb. The attack was reported to be revenge for an altercation between Noubissi’s younger brother and another teenager. March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 The area has not crashed into the headlines for such violence since, but La Villeneuve is nevertheless seen as a place “that sucks”, according to local journalist Benjamin Bultel. Its buildings have been poorly maintained; its schools have a bad reputation, he says. This is a world away from how it was envisaged. La Villeneuve, or “new city”, was actually a neighbourhood born of high ideals. It was built in the 1970s to create a community that would be different from other more ghettoised French suburbs. The development, which has a 14-hectare wooded park, large lake, and a view of the mountains, sought to attract residents from a mix of social backgrounds. The neighbourhood was designed to be self-sufficient, with its own schools, shops and other services. Residents have spoken fondly of how sociable and ground-breaking the development was at first, with skating on the lake in the winter, doors left unlocked, and anenlightened education system. Grenoble urban planner Maïlys Toussaint says the project attracted a wide range of residents in the early days and became home to people who wanted to rebuild their lives; economic and political immigrants; or residents of a city-centre district under renovation. “The children found a huge playground, the residents ate meals with their neighbours in the walkways... there was even a neighbourhood television station run by the residents.” But experts say reality failed to live up to the dream, and after only a few years the vast majority of the middle classes moved away. And then in 1983 the housing policy was changed to prioritise those on low incomes, changing the social blend. ""Many people blame the deterioration of La Villeneuve and Arlequin on the municipality elected in 1983 and its political choices,” says Toussaint. “It's a project that would have required support and there was none.” Bultel, a reporter with La Villeneuve’s Le Crieur newspaper and a current resident, says it has never recovered from the violence of 2010, despite residents trying various initiatives to change its image. Toussaint, who lived in the suburb when she was a student, says her first-hand experience challenged her preconceptions. ""I had seen La Villeneuve on the TV news at the time of the riots, and had been afraid of this neighbourhood without even knowing it. But I ended up settling there a few years later. You have to go beyond clichés and try to understand what is really going on there. This stigmatisation is a real suffering for the residents,"" she says. She says current renovation works in La Villeneuve’s Arlequin district are designed to try to lure back the middle classes. Bultel says the address is so stigmatised that its young residents struggle to get a job, or even an internship. He stresses, though, that there are many positive aspects to the suburb. Social ties are stronger in the area than in the city centre, he argues, with some families having lived there for generations. “During the lockdown, neighbours shared food, internet connections, information about the pandemic… people made face masks for their neighbours, young people did shopping for the elderly... “Some Arlequin people set up a choir and sang on their balcony every evening at 6pm.” Mouhsine says La Villeneuve’s reputation is unjustified. ""We're not going to deny that there are a lot of problems in Villeneuve, but there are also great human values, such as solidarity,"" he says. Grenoble mayor Eric Piolle acknowledged this community spirit in a post about the rescue on hisFacebook page. “Hand in hand, they allowed the two little ones to get out of this tragedy unscathed. Faithful to the tradition of… mutual aid in Grenoble, particularly strong in La Villeneuve all year round, as we have seen during lockdown… it is together they were able to rescue the children,” he wrote. Ten days after the fire, Piolle presented the seven men injured in the rescue effort with medals of honour at City Hall. But only six of them had their identities inscribed on their medals. Bilal’s name was left off. The Algerian, who is reported to have fled the rescue scene when the fire service arrived, is an undocumented migrant. According to French media he arrived in France in 2018, and has been sleeping on friends’ floors doing odd jobs. He hopes to get the necessary paperwork to live and work legally,reports say. Eric Piolle also awarded a collective medal to other residents who were uninjured in the rescue but nevertheless helped,or tried to do so. One of those given the collective medal was Algerian Malika Kredimi. She had been on her way home from the pharmacy when she spotted the drama unfolding and, as a good friend of the family, took the children home for a bath and change of clothes. She says they were covered head-to-toe in soot. The boys were then taken to hospital to check for smoke inhalation, and an investigation was launched into why their parents had left them locked in their apartment alone. According to Grenoble public prosecutors, the father left to go to work at 1130. The children’s mother, Rachida, had not yet returned from a shopping trip. Rachida was filmed giving an emotional speech at themedal ceremony. “Some say that the Villeneuve district is not good... I will never forget what these people did for my children. The people of the neighbourhood have not let us down. I don't know if there is solidarity like this in other neighbourhoods,” she said. But the way in which City Hall rewarded those involved has not been without controversy. Some in the wider crowd feel others should have been given more recognition. Bultel says dozens of residents were involved in the rescue effort, with activities ranging from trying to reach the children via another balcony to directing the fire brigade to the scene. The injuries of the seven who caught the boys were in some cases severe, and some of the men required surgery. And most have needed support from a psychologist, organised by a national victim support organisation and Grenoble City Council. Elyasse, a father of three who left Algeria 20 years ago during the civil war, says he still has flashbacks to that day in July.  ""The children are shouting, the smoke, the flames, it keeps coming back. As soon as I see or smell smoke, I am immediately transported back to these scenes."" Mouhsine says he is so traumatised that he is thinking of leaving the neighbourhood. ""I can't forget the faces of these two kids, I... have nightmares about them,"" he says. Malika’s seven-year-old son, Salah, who watched the rescue with his mother, also has bad dreams. He can’t understand why his friend, Sofiane, threw his little brother out of the window. The rescuers have not seen the children again, but Arlequin’s social centre is planning a reunion as soon as Sofiane, the older boy, feels ready. ""Keeping calm, keeping his little brother in a safe place, calling for help, not panicking, dealing with the situation - it was incredible. Even an adult couldn't have done better,"" Elyasse says. ""They call us heroes. But for all of us, the real hero is the big brother.”  Writer: Myriam Lahouari Editor: Sarah Buckley Illustrations: George Wafula Photography: Pierre Bascugnana Graphics: Debie Loizou Video: Souhaila Saidi / EVN Additional images: Getty Images, Mouhsine Sbiti, Guelord Musumar, Lucas Reizmives, Walid Athoumani, Hechmi Selmi, Elyasse Ben Taleb, Malika Kredimi, Thierry Chenu - Grenoble City Council Online Production: James Percy Published: October 2020",Positive,1.0

"Cineworld is set to temporarily close its UK cinemas in the coming weeks. As first reported inthe Sunday Times,external, the firm is writing to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden to say the industry is now ""unviable"". The firm says it has been hit by delays in the release of big-budget films, putting 5,500 jobs at risk. The premiere of James Bond film No Time To Die has been postponed twice and is now due for release in April 2021. It is hoped that the Cineworld cinemas will be able to reopen next year, with staff being asked to accept redundancy in the hope of rejoining the company when theatres open again. The head of the UK Cinema Association said he feared the Cineworld closure was ""indicative of challenges faced by the entire UK cinema industry at the moment"". Phil Clapp said: ""Although cinemas opened in July and have been able to deliver a safe and enjoyable experience, without major new titles then we understand we aren't able to get as many people out of the home as we'd like."" The Bectu union says the delay in releasing the new Bond film has hit cinemas He said no-one would be ""untouched by the current challenges"". Philippa Childs of entertainment and broadcasting union Bectu said: ""The delay in the release of the Bond film along with the other delayed releases has plunged cinema into crisis. ""Studios will have to think carefully when considering release dates about the impact that will have for the long-term future of the big screen."" When approached by the BBC, major UK chains Vue and Odeon refused to comment on how many cinemas they might be keeping open. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it was supporting cinemas through a VAT cut on tickets and concessions, business rates holiday and bounce-back loans. ""We urge the British public to support their local cinema and save jobs by visiting and enjoying a film in accordance with the [Covid-19] guidance."" Cineworld's sites in the US, where it operates 546 theatres, could also be forced to close. Cineworld said in a statement: ""We can confirm we are considering the temporary closure of our UK and US cinemas, but a final decision has not yet been reached. ""Once a decision has been made we will update all staff and customers as soon as we can."" In September the firm reported a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June as its cinemas had to close because of coronavirus lockdowns. And it warned at the time that it might need to raise more money in the event of further restrictions - or film delays - due to Covid-19. Cineworld directors waive salaries as virus impact hits Tenet gives shot in arm to UK and Ireland cinemas What are the new coronavirus restrictions? Cineworld is the world's second largest cinema operator, and the largest in the UK with 120 sites. It also owns the Picturehouse chain of smaller venues. Its other theatres globally include the Regal, Cinema City, and Yes Planet brands. According to the UK Cinema Association, operators should ""organise seating to ensure two-metre distancing can be maintained; where two metres is not viable, one metre with risk mitigation is acceptable. Mitigations should be considered and those introduced set out in the risk assessment"". But in Scotland they must ""organise seating to ensure two-metre distancing can be maintained"". It also says cinemas should introduce one-way flow through auditoriums, and provide floor markings and signage to remind customers to ""follow social distancing wherever possible."" The film industry had hoped the release of No Time To Die would spark a movie-going revival in the UK, with so many cinemas having been mothballed for months following the Covid-19 lockdown in March. But on Friday the movie's release was further delayed until 2 April 2021 ""in order to be seen by a worldwide theatrical audience"". Rob Arthur, an industry analyst at cinema strategists The Big Picture, said ""the current market is broken"". ""It has been a very challenging year both for Cineworld, and the world's largest cinema group AMC,"" he added. ""Film release schedules are being changed on a daily, never mind weekly, basis. It has been a catastrophic, devastating, year for operators."" He said the decision by Cineworld to put their UK operation ""into hibernation"" until next year made sense. ""You can't keep meeting the fixed operating costs of electricity, gas, air conditioning, staff, social distancing measures, and so forth when audience numbers are only a small percentage of what they were before,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, customer confidence in visiting cinemas has to be restored and I don't see that at the moment,"" Mr Arthur added. ""The crowds you used to see in London for example going from work directly to the cinema are not there."" He also said Cineworld's cash reserves were running low and that both they and AMC had a high percentage of financial liabilities compared with their assets. He added: ""Landlords to date have acted reasonably and the deferral of rent has helped the cinema industry, but that comes to an end as does furlough payments so the operators will have to seek remedies to restructure their businesses."" As lockdown restrictions around the world were gradually lifted in mid-to-late summer Cineworld had been able to reopen 561 out of 778 sites worldwide. But lockdown closures meant its group revenues sank to $712.4m in the first six months of the year, compared with $2.15bn a year earlier. The group loss this year also marked a huge fall from the pre-tax profits of $139.7m seen in the first six months of 2019. However, when it released those financial figures, Cineworld said recent trading had been ""encouraging considering the circumstances"", with solid demand for Christopher Nolan's spy film Tenet which was released in September. In June, Cineworld pulled out of a $2.1bn deal to buy the Canadian cinema chain Cineplex, a move which could lead to a legal battle. It is not just Cineworld which has struggled this year, with independent London cinema Peckhamplex closing its doors on 25 September due to falling visitor numbers and delayed releases. It had hoped to reopen in November, around the time the next James Bond film was due to be released.

" By Myriam Lahouari Minutes earlier, three of them had tried to wrench open the apartment door. But it was too swollen by the heat of the fire. So the brothers, three and 10 years old, are trapped. They are crying at a window, 15m (49 feet) up, choking on thick black smoke billowing behind them. To their left, flames rage from a carpet draped over a balcony railing. Their apartment is in La Villeneuve, a French modernist suburb once heralded as a social utopia, but which has since suffered decades of stigma and neglect. Hechmi, Walid, and Lucas - the men who tried to force the boys’ door - have run back down the tower block stairs to join four others outside. They are Elyasse, Guelord, Mouhsine and Bilal. None of the men knows each other. The suburb in Grenoble, south-eastern France, is home to several thousand people - a town within a town. A crowd is looking on, panicked by the scene unfolding before them. Mouhsine asks if anyone knows the name of the eldest boy. “Sofiane,” someone replies. The men call up to Sofiane, telling him that he and his brother have to jump. Guelord shouts that the younger boy needs to go first. Sofiane should throw him down. The 10-year-old hesitates. He looks at the ground. Behind him the smoke has thickened; the balcony is burning even more fiercely. “It’s better to break an arm or a hand than to burn at home,” Hechmi shouts up. Sofiane grabs his brother, Soleiman, and dangles him by his T-shirt out of the window. But he doesn’t immediately let go. He’s looking down, seeing if the men are ready. “He held him for a few seconds in the air - he wanted to make sure that his brother would land in our arms,” recounts Elyasse. Sofiane drops Soleiman. The onlookers scream. The three-year-old, crashing through the air like ""a cannonball"", according to Elyasse, bangs his foot against a windowsill which flips him, so that he is now plummeting head first. Mouhsine manages to catch him with the help of his chest, Hechmi with his shoulders. Behind, Bilal helps Mouhsine brace against the impact. The three men collapse to the ground. Mouhsine Sbiti Mouhsine Sbiti Guelord Musumar Guelord Musumar Lucas Reizmives Lucas Reizmives Walid Athoumani Walid Athoumani Hechmi Selmi Hechmi Selmi Elyasse Ben Taleb Elyasse Ben Taleb Bilal Bilal Mouhsine Sbiti Mouhsine Sbiti Guelord Musumar Guelord Musumar Lucas Reizmives Lucas Reizmives Walid Athoumani Walid Athoumani Hechmi Selmi Hechmi Selmi Elyasse Ben Taleb Elyasse Ben Taleb Bilal Bilal The men started out on 21 July as strangers, even though most live in or close to Arlequin, a neighbourhood in La Villeneuve known for its multicoloured tenements. Mouhsine Sbiti had moved from Morocco just one month earlier to an apartment 200m from the burning building - Arlequin’s tower 54. He was on his way to the supermarket when he heard screams. Guelord Musumar, a special-needs teacher from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who lives near La Villeneuve, was on his way to the tower block to meet his father-in-law for lunch when he saw the commotion. The two youngest men, Lucas Reizmives and Walid Athoumani, saw the flames from their neighbouring apartment blocks. Walid, a 25-year-old student from the Comoros, sprinted into the lift of tower 54. He was joined at the children’s door by Lucas, a 19-year-old Romanian construction worker, who had hurtled up the stairs. Hechmi Selmi, originally from Tunisia, had been photocopying documents in Arlequin’s social centre. He came outside to find the temperature had soared in the midday sun. Lifting his head to swig from a bottle of water, he saw the smoke out the corner of his eye. Elyasse Ben Taleb, an Algerian lift technician, had been carrying out checks in Arlequin and was rounding the corner of the block for his last appointment before lunch when he drove past the commotion, stopped the car, and ran back. Now, just minutes after gathering at the foot of the tower block, they are holding Soleiman. ""It's like a vehicle falling into your arms… I felt a terrible pain,"" recounts Elyasse. But they have done it - the boy is safe. It’s Hechmi who gets up with the three-year-old, and as he lifts him up, he feels his back cracking. He is too injured to help with the second rescue. The other six get back into position. Ten-year-old Sofiane is much bigger and heavier than his brother. Mouhsine, a former security forces officer with the Royal Palace in Rabat, looks up and tries to estimate. About 40 kilos, he guesses. He knows the force will be much more difficult to absorb. Guelord is to his right, strong enough, Mouhsine reckons, that between them they can lock together to brace against the impact. He grabs the 29-year-old’s arm. The men are worried - they can’t see Sofiane. But he soon reappears through the thickening smoke. He climbs through the open window to sit on the sill. His feet dangle over the edge, and he looks down at the ground. The men wait. It seems like an eternity but it's only a few seconds. Finally, he levers himself over the windowsill, hangs, then lets go. His right foot strikes Mouhsine, his left foot Guelord. Both fall under the impact. Mouhsine screams in pain. The bone in his wrist looks deformed. Guelord realises he has broken his thumb. Walid has fractured his wrist, Lucas his hand. Bilal is thought to have broken a finger. But Sofiane is unharmed. “He landed directly into our arms,” says Walid.  Elyasse weeps in relief. “The two children were unscathed - it’s a miracle,” he reflects. ""We didn't have much time to discuss and decide, everything was done by instinct,"" adds Mouhsine. Souhaila Saidi / EVN Souhaila Saidi / EVN “L’acte heroique,” proclaimed Grenoble’s newspaper Le Dauphine Libere. The story was carried by national and international media, brought to life by dramatic mobile-phone footage. But the euphoric headlines could not convey a striking detail. The boys were saved by a group of immigrants on the very same estate that erupted - almost 10 years previously to the day - in violent rioting, prompting an excoriating anti-immigration speech by then French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In the summer of 2010, a man from La Villeneuve was suspected of stealing from a local casino, and was killed in the police shoot-out that followed. His death triggered three nights of looting and arson in the area. A few days later Sarkozy made a hard-hitting and widely criticised security speech in Grenoble. “We are seeing the consequences of 50 years of insufficiently controlled immigration, which have ended in the failure of integration,” he said. “We are so proud of our integration system. Perhaps we need to wake up? To see what it has produced. It worked. It doesn't work any more.” He called for foreign-born residents threatening the police to be stripped of their citizenship. Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Riots in Villeneuve, Grenoble, July 2010 Two years later, La Villeneuve hit the headlines again when a group of youths from the estate brutally murdered Kevin Noubissi and his friend Sofiane Tadbirt in a neighbouring suburb. The attack was reported to be revenge for an altercation between Noubissi’s younger brother and another teenager. March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 March for Kevin and Sofiane, September 2012 The area has not crashed into the headlines for such violence since, but La Villeneuve is nevertheless seen as a place “that sucks”, according to local journalist Benjamin Bultel. Its buildings have been poorly maintained; its schools have a bad reputation, he says. This is a world away from how it was envisaged. La Villeneuve, or “new city”, was actually a neighbourhood born of high ideals. It was built in the 1970s to create a community that would be different from other more ghettoised French suburbs. The development, which has a 14-hectare wooded park, large lake, and a view of the mountains, sought to attract residents from a mix of social backgrounds. The neighbourhood was designed to be self-sufficient, with its own schools, shops and other services. Residents have spoken fondly of how sociable and ground-breaking the development was at first, with skating on the lake in the winter, doors left unlocked, and anenlightened education system. Grenoble urban planner Maïlys Toussaint says the project attracted a wide range of residents in the early days and became home to people who wanted to rebuild their lives; economic and political immigrants; or residents of a city-centre district under renovation. “The children found a huge playground, the residents ate meals with their neighbours in the walkways... there was even a neighbourhood television station run by the residents.” But experts say reality failed to live up to the dream, and after only a few years the vast majority of the middle classes moved away. And then in 1983 the housing policy was changed to prioritise those on low incomes, changing the social blend. ""Many people blame the deterioration of La Villeneuve and Arlequin on the municipality elected in 1983 and its political choices,” says Toussaint. “It's a project that would have required support and there was none.” Bultel, a reporter with La Villeneuve’s Le Crieur newspaper and a current resident, says it has never recovered from the violence of 2010, despite residents trying various initiatives to change its image. Toussaint, who lived in the suburb when she was a student, says her first-hand experience challenged her preconceptions. ""I had seen La Villeneuve on the TV news at the time of the riots, and had been afraid of this neighbourhood without even knowing it. But I ended up settling there a few years later. You have to go beyond clichés and try to understand what is really going on there. This stigmatisation is a real suffering for the residents,"" she says. She says current renovation works in La Villeneuve’s Arlequin district are designed to try to lure back the middle classes. Bultel says the address is so stigmatised that its young residents struggle to get a job, or even an internship. He stresses, though, that there are many positive aspects to the suburb. Social ties are stronger in the area than in the city centre, he argues, with some families having lived there for generations. “During the lockdown, neighbours shared food, internet connections, information about the pandemic… people made face masks for their neighbours, young people did shopping for the elderly... “Some Arlequin people set up a choir and sang on their balcony every evening at 6pm.” Mouhsine says La Villeneuve’s reputation is unjustified. ""We're not going to deny that there are a lot of problems in Villeneuve, but there are also great human values, such as solidarity,"" he says. Grenoble mayor Eric Piolle acknowledged this community spirit in a post about the rescue on hisFacebook page. “Hand in hand, they allowed the two little ones to get out of this tragedy unscathed. Faithful to the tradition of… mutual aid in Grenoble, particularly strong in La Villeneuve all year round, as we have seen during lockdown… it is together they were able to rescue the children,” he wrote. Ten days after the fire, Piolle presented the seven men injured in the rescue effort with medals of honour at City Hall. But only six of them had their identities inscribed on their medals. Bilal’s name was left off. The Algerian, who is reported to have fled the rescue scene when the fire service arrived, is an undocumented migrant. According to French media he arrived in France in 2018, and has been sleeping on friends’ floors doing odd jobs. He hopes to get the necessary paperwork to live and work legally,reports say. Eric Piolle also awarded a collective medal to other residents who were uninjured in the rescue but nevertheless helped,or tried to do so. One of those given the collective medal was Algerian Malika Kredimi. She had been on her way home from the pharmacy when she spotted the drama unfolding and, as a good friend of the family, took the children home for a bath and change of clothes. She says they were covered head-to-toe in soot. The boys were then taken to hospital to check for smoke inhalation, and an investigation was launched into why their parents had left them locked in their apartment alone. According to Grenoble public prosecutors, the father left to go to work at 1130. The children’s mother, Rachida, had not yet returned from a shopping trip. Rachida was filmed giving an emotional speech at themedal ceremony. “Some say that the Villeneuve district is not good... I will never forget what these people did for my children. The people of the neighbourhood have not let us down. I don't know if there is solidarity like this in other neighbourhoods,” she said. But the way in which City Hall rewarded those involved has not been without controversy. Some in the wider crowd feel others should have been given more recognition. Bultel says dozens of residents were involved in the rescue effort, with activities ranging from trying to reach the children via another balcony to directing the fire brigade to the scene. The injuries of the seven who caught the boys were in some cases severe, and some of the men required surgery. And most have needed support from a psychologist, organised by a national victim support organisation and Grenoble City Council. Elyasse, a father of three who left Algeria 20 years ago during the civil war, says he still has flashbacks to that day in July.  ""The children are shouting, the smoke, the flames, it keeps coming back. As soon as I see or smell smoke, I am immediately transported back to these scenes."" Mouhsine says he is so traumatised that he is thinking of leaving the neighbourhood. ""I can't forget the faces of these two kids, I... have nightmares about them,"" he says. Malika’s seven-year-old son, Salah, who watched the rescue with his mother, also has bad dreams. He can’t understand why his friend, Sofiane, threw his little brother out of the window. The rescuers have not seen the children again, but Arlequin’s social centre is planning a reunion as soon as Sofiane, the older boy, feels ready. ""Keeping calm, keeping his little brother in a safe place, calling for help, not panicking, dealing with the situation - it was incredible. Even an adult couldn't have done better,"" Elyasse says. ""They call us heroes. But for all of us, the real hero is the big brother.”  Writer: Myriam Lahouari Editor: Sarah Buckley Illustrations: George Wafula Photography: Pierre Bascugnana Graphics: Debie Loizou Video: Souhaila Saidi / EVN Additional images: Getty Images, Mouhsine Sbiti, Guelord Musumar, Lucas Reizmives, Walid Athoumani, Hechmi Selmi, Elyasse Ben Taleb, Malika Kredimi, Thierry Chenu - Grenoble City Council Online Production: James Percy Published: October 2020",Positive,1.0
"The stone marks the life of a man, known only as Abell, who died in 1717 A stone commemorating the first recorded black resident in Liverpool has been unveiled more than 300 years after his death. Records show the man, known only as Abell, was buried at St Nicholas' Church on 1 October 1717. Thousands of enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic on Liverpool-registered ships in the 18th Century transatlantic slave trade. Written evidence shows there was also a rising population of black residents at the time. Much of the city's 18th Century wealth came from the slave trade In 1700, Liverpool was a fishing port with a population of 5,000 people but by 1800, there were 78,000 residents, with thousands finding work due to the slave trade. During the 18th Century, Liverpool made about Â£300,000 a year from the slave trade - the equivalent of the total generated by the rest of Britain's slave trading ports put together. In the 1780s, Liverpool-based vessels carried more than 300,000 Africans into slavery. By 1795, Liverpool controlled more than 60% of the British - and more than 40% of the European - slave trade. Nearly all the main merchants and citizens of Liverpool, including many of the mayors, were involved. Source:BBC Bitesize The stone, which marks the anniversary of Abell's funeral and coincides with Black History Month, was unveiled by Councillor Anna Rothery, who became Liverpool's first black lord mayor last year. She said: ""As a city we are facing up to the grim injustices of our past and, by setting them in their context, we are a better place."" Hundreds of people joined a Black Lives Matter protest in Liverpool this summer More than 12.5m Africanswere traded as slaves between 1515 and the mid-19th Century. Some two million of the enslaved men, women and children died en route to the Americas. Rector of Liverpool, Revd Canon Dr Crispin Pailing, said: ""We cannot hide from our past, and there is no institution from this era of our history which is free from the taint of this horrific trade. ""We cannot give justice to Abell and other enslaved Africans, but we can give them the dignity of naming them when we can, and we can give them status within the history of our city.""

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. The president announced that he and his wife and his wife,Melaniahas tested positive for Covid-19, in a tweet sent on Friday at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Who is Hope Hicks? How will this affect US election? So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact-tracing. Here's a look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"": President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, JudgeAmy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn. This video can not be played Senator Mike Lee, who later tested positive for Covid-19, seen hugging other attendees Judge Coney Barrett said on Friday that she had tested negative. Sources told US media she had the virus earlier this year. Along with Mr Trump and his wife, at least seven other people who attended the Rose Garden event say they have tested positive - although it's not known where they caught the virus. They are: White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnany; former White House counsellorKellyanne Conway; SenatorMike Leeof Utah and SenatorThom Tillisof North Carolina, who are both on the judiciary committee; the president of the University of Notre Dame,John Jenkins; and former New Jersey GovernorChris Christie,who said he checked himself into a hospital on Saturday as a precaution. The White House Correspondents' Association said anunnamed reporterat the event had also tested positive with symptoms. During the evening, President Trump held a rally at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania. Since the afternoon's ceremony, Judge Coney Barrett has held meetings with various senators - including Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell- ahead of her much-anticipated confirmation hearing, due to take place on 12 October. The president played golf at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, in the morning and led a White House reception for the families of military veterans during the evening. On Monday, President Trump held a news briefing in the White House Rose Garden - giving an update on his administration's coronavirus testing strategy. It was attended by Vice-PresidentMike Pence,Health SecretaryAlex Azar,Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories,Robert Ford, among others. Later, Trump viewed a model of a new pickup truck - being built at a factory in Ohio - on the White House lawn. Representatives from the company, Lordstown Motors, attended, as well as two members of Congress. The White House regularly tests officials who come in contact with the president. However, US media has noted that mask-wearing and social distancing around him is less common - suggesting that people may be too reliant on the testing system, which is not foolproof. The president faced his election rival,Joe Biden, at their first face-to-face debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday evening. President Trump flew there on his presidential plane, Air Force One, alongside his wife, adult children and multiple aides. Many were seen not wearing masks when boarding or disembarking. Also on the plane were: White House Chief of staffMark Meadows; campaign strategistJason Miller; policy adviserStephen Miller;Robert C O'Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Ohio CongressmanJim Jordan. After landing, the president's campaign manager,Bill Stepien, was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms Hicks, the New York Times reports. Late on Friday, it was announced that Mr Stepien had tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. The debate was held at Cleveland Clinic's Health Education Campus, a shared facility with Case Western Reserve University. The organisers, the Commission on Presidential Debates, brought in numerous Covid-era safety precautions. There were no handshakes between the two candidates and everyone attending - including the 80 or so audience members - was tested before the event and asked to wear masks throughout. In the run-up, Mr Trump's eldest daughter,Ivanka, posted a picture of herself backstage in a mask, alongside her sisterTiffany, sister-in-lawLaraand stepmotherMelania. Allow Instagram content?

However, during the event itself, Ivanka Trump and other family members, including siblingsDon JrandEric, were pictured mask-less. ModeratorChris Wallacehas since told Fox News that they were offered masks by event staff but they refused them. Observers said those on Mr Biden's side of the room kept their masks on. Mr Trump and Mr Biden kept a distance during the debate, at podiums on opposite sides of the stage. Mr Trump and Mr Biden loudly spoke over each other throughout the contentious debate When the candidates were greeted by the wives on stage afterwards,Jill Bidenwore a mask and Melania Trump didn't. At a separate campaign event in Pennsylvania, Vice-PresidentMike Pencesaid he had been in the Oval Office with President Trump earlier that day. It is thought to be their last in-person meeting. President Trump and much of his entourage flew back to Washington DC on Tuesday night. The day after the debate, President Trump was straight back into campaign business, flying to Minnesota. Ms Hicks was among those accompanying him. At a press conference on Saturday, the president's physician Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump had been diagnosed 72 hours previously, which would place his diagnosis on Wednesday. But the White House later clarified that he was diagnosed on Thursday.

Few wore masks but there was distance between them and the president. Minnesota CongressmanKurt Daudttweeted a picture of himself close to Mr Trump, with neither wearing masks. Allow Twitter content?

The president's rally at Duluth airport On Wednesday evening, Mr Trump and various aides returned to Washington DC on Air Force One again. Meanwhile Ms Hicks, who was feeling unwell, was isolated in a separate cabin, according to US media. She reportedly disembarked from the back of the plane, instead of the front alongside the other passengers. The following day, Ms Hicks tested positive for coronavirus. President Trump flew to his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraiser. Several aides who were in proximity to Ms Hicks scrapped their plans to accompany the president, according to the Associated Press. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, is thought to have been in close contact with Ms Hicks. Ms McEnany held a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, without mentioning her colleague's test and without wearing a mask. She has since said she did not know about the diagnosis. That night, in pre-taped remarks to the annual Al Smith dinner in New York City - held virtually this year - Mr Trump said that ""the end of the pandemic is in sight"". This video can not be played ""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" President Trump told a dinner on Thursday He later announced in an interview on Fox News that he and the first lady were being tested for the virus.

""They want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,"" he said. President Trump announced that he and Mrs Trump had tested positive, adding that they will begin the ""quarantine and recovery process immediately"".

"The stone marks the life of a man, known only as Abell, who died in 1717 A stone commemorating the first recorded black resident in Liverpool has been unveiled more than 300 years after his death. Records show the man, known only as Abell, was buried at St Nicholas' Church on 1 October 1717. Thousands of enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic on Liverpool-registered ships in the 18th Century transatlantic slave trade. Written evidence shows there was also a rising population of black residents at the time. Much of the city's 18th Century wealth came from the slave trade In 1700, Liverpool was a fishing port with a population of 5,000 people but by 1800, there were 78,000 residents, with thousands finding work due to the slave trade. During the 18th Century, Liverpool made about Â£300,000 a year from the slave trade - the equivalent of the total generated by the rest of Britain's slave trading ports put together. In the 1780s, Liverpool-based vessels carried more than 300,000 Africans into slavery. By 1795, Liverpool controlled more than 60% of the British - and more than 40% of the European - slave trade. Nearly all the main merchants and citizens of Liverpool, including many of the mayors, were involved. Source:BBC Bitesize The stone, which marks the anniversary of Abell's funeral and coincides with Black History Month, was unveiled by Councillor Anna Rothery, who became Liverpool's first black lord mayor last year. She said: ""As a city we are facing up to the grim injustices of our past and, by setting them in their context, we are a better place."" Hundreds of people joined a Black Lives Matter protest in Liverpool this summer More than 12.5m Africanswere traded as slaves between 1515 and the mid-19th Century. Some two million of the enslaved men, women and children died en route to the Americas. Rector of Liverpool, Revd Canon Dr Crispin Pailing, said: ""We cannot hide from our past, and there is no institution from this era of our history which is free from the taint of this horrific trade. ""We cannot give justice to Abell and other enslaved Africans, but we can give them the dignity of naming them when we can, and we can give them status within the history of our city.""

"This video can not be played Storm Alex: See the moment a building is swept into raging flood waters At least two people have died and up to 20 are still missing after a powerful storm hit south-eastern France and north-western Italy. Named Alex, the storm brought fierce winds and torrential rain. A number of villages north of Nice in France suffered serious damage from floods and landslides, with roads, bridges and homes destroyed. In north-western Italy, flooding was described as ""historic"". A section of a bridge over the Sesia river collapsed. Flood warnings as heavy rain continues in UK French Prime Minister Jean Castex has deployed the army and released emergency funds to tackle the worst floods for decades in south-eastern France. Up to 20 people are either missing or have not checked in with relatives. ""There are very many people of whom we have no news,"" Mr Castex said. Flood damage in Saint-Martin-Vesubie in the Alpes-Maritimes of south-eastern France Bernard Gonzalez, prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes region, said: ""Just because their loved ones haven't been able to get in touch doesn't mean that they have been taken by the storm."" He said the prospect of more rain was ""a worry"". Meteorological agency MÃ©tÃ©o-France said 450mm (17.7in) of rain fell in some areas over 24 hours - the equivalent of nearly four months at this time of year, reports Reuters news agency. The southern Alps region appeared the worst hit, with serious damage in the Roya, TinÃ©e, Esteron and VÃ©subie valleys. The villages of Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie and Rimplas were cut off, with roads inaccessible. A collapsed bridge after heavy rains hit the village of RoquebilliÃ¨re in southern France A road in RoquebilliÃ¨re was partially washed away during the storm One 29-year-old resident of RoquebilliÃ¨re told Agence France-Presse: ""I lost everything but we are alive. There must be one room left in my house."" Two elderly people were swept away as their house collapsed in the village and their fate is unknown. On Friday, the storm also buffeted France's western Atlantic coast, causing tens of thousands of homes to lose power. Winds of more than 180km/h (112mph) were recorded in Brittany on Thursday and Friday. The two fatalities were a 53-year-old firefighter in the Aosta Valley who died during a rescue operation, and a 36-year-old man whose car was swept into a river in the Piedmont region. His brother managed to get out of the car. A section of a key bridge over the Sesia river in Piedmont's Vercelli province collapsed shortly after it had been reopened on Saturday afternoon. Damaged caused to a road near Cuneo in Italy's Piedmont region In the rest of Piedmont, several villages were cut off after the rains made roads impassable. The situation there was described as ""extremely critical"" by officials. Piedmont President Alberto Cirio told La Stampa that 630mm of rain had fallen in 24 hours, an amount ""unheard of since 1954"". Hundreds of aid workers have been sent to help rescue efforts in the cut-off villages. The storm also affected the north-western regions of Lombardy and Liguria. The Roja river in Ventimiglia has also flooded. Flood alerts remain for sections of the Po river which have swollen by 3m in 24 hours. One good piece of news was the rescue of about 20 people reported missing by Italian authorities just over the border in France. Venice's newly built Mose flooding system went into operation The city of Venice, which had been braced for high waters after suffering violent storms in August, was successfully protected by a flood barrier system recently declared fully operational.

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him

James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played President Trump's seven days before his Covid-positive test President Donald Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. The president announced that he and his wife and his wife,Melaniahas tested positive for Covid-19, in a tweet sent on Friday at around 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. Covid: What is the risk to Donald Trump's health? Who is Hope Hicks? How will this affect US election? So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact-tracing. Here's a look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"": President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, JudgeAmy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn. This video can not be played Senator Mike Lee, who later tested positive for Covid-19, seen hugging other attendees Judge Coney Barrett said on Friday that she had tested negative. Sources told US media she had the virus earlier this year. Along with Mr Trump and his wife, at least seven other people who attended the Rose Garden event say they have tested positive - although it's not known where they caught the virus. They are: White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnany; former White House counsellorKellyanne Conway; SenatorMike Leeof Utah and SenatorThom Tillisof North Carolina, who are both on the judiciary committee; the president of the University of Notre Dame,John Jenkins; and former New Jersey GovernorChris Christie,who said he checked himself into a hospital on Saturday as a precaution. The White House Correspondents' Association said anunnamed reporterat the event had also tested positive with symptoms. During the evening, President Trump held a rally at Harrisburg International Airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania. Since the afternoon's ceremony, Judge Coney Barrett has held meetings with various senators - including Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell- ahead of her much-anticipated confirmation hearing, due to take place on 12 October. The president played golf at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, in the morning and led a White House reception for the families of military veterans during the evening. On Monday, President Trump held a news briefing in the White House Rose Garden - giving an update on his administration's coronavirus testing strategy. It was attended by Vice-PresidentMike Pence,Health SecretaryAlex Azar,Education SecretaryBetsy DeVos, and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories,Robert Ford, among others. Later, Trump viewed a model of a new pickup truck - being built at a factory in Ohio - on the White House lawn. Representatives from the company, Lordstown Motors, attended, as well as two members of Congress. The White House regularly tests officials who come in contact with the president. However, US media has noted that mask-wearing and social distancing around him is less common - suggesting that people may be too reliant on the testing system, which is not foolproof. The president faced his election rival,Joe Biden, at their first face-to-face debate in Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday evening. President Trump flew there on his presidential plane, Air Force One, alongside his wife, adult children and multiple aides. Many were seen not wearing masks when boarding or disembarking. Also on the plane were: White House Chief of staffMark Meadows; campaign strategistJason Miller; policy adviserStephen Miller;Robert C O'Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Ohio CongressmanJim Jordan. After landing, the president's campaign manager,Bill Stepien, was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms Hicks, the New York Times reports. Late on Friday, it was announced that Mr Stepien had tested positive for Covid-19 and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. The debate was held at Cleveland Clinic's Health Education Campus, a shared facility with Case Western Reserve University. The organisers, the Commission on Presidential Debates, brought in numerous Covid-era safety precautions. There were no handshakes between the two candidates and everyone attending - including the 80 or so audience members - was tested before the event and asked to wear masks throughout. In the run-up, Mr Trump's eldest daughter,Ivanka, posted a picture of herself backstage in a mask, alongside her sisterTiffany, sister-in-lawLaraand stepmotherMelania. Allow Instagram content?

However, during the event itself, Ivanka Trump and other family members, including siblingsDon JrandEric, were pictured mask-less. ModeratorChris Wallacehas since told Fox News that they were offered masks by event staff but they refused them. Observers said those on Mr Biden's side of the room kept their masks on. Mr Trump and Mr Biden kept a distance during the debate, at podiums on opposite sides of the stage. Mr Trump and Mr Biden loudly spoke over each other throughout the contentious debate When the candidates were greeted by the wives on stage afterwards,Jill Bidenwore a mask and Melania Trump didn't. At a separate campaign event in Pennsylvania, Vice-PresidentMike Pencesaid he had been in the Oval Office with President Trump earlier that day. It is thought to be their last in-person meeting. President Trump and much of his entourage flew back to Washington DC on Tuesday night. The day after the debate, President Trump was straight back into campaign business, flying to Minnesota. Ms Hicks was among those accompanying him. At a press conference on Saturday, the president's physician Dr Sean Conley said Mr Trump had been diagnosed 72 hours previously, which would place his diagnosis on Wednesday. But the White House later clarified that he was diagnosed on Thursday. He attended a closed-door fundraiser at a private home in Minneapolis, and later held a rally at an airport in Duluth, in front of a crowd of thousands. Few wore masks but there was distance between them and the president. Minnesota CongressmanKurt Daudttweeted a picture of himself close to Mr Trump, with neither wearing masks. Allow Twitter content?

The president's rally at Duluth airport On Wednesday evening, Mr Trump and various aides returned to Washington DC on Air Force One again. Meanwhile Ms Hicks, who was feeling unwell, was isolated in a separate cabin, according to US media. She reportedly disembarked from the back of the plane, instead of the front alongside the other passengers. The following day, Ms Hicks tested positive for coronavirus. President Trump flew to his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey for a private fundraiser. Several aides who were in proximity to Ms Hicks scrapped their plans to accompany the president, according to the Associated Press. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, is thought to have been in close contact with Ms Hicks. Ms McEnany held a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, without mentioning her colleague's test and without wearing a mask. She has since said she did not know about the diagnosis. That night, in pre-taped remarks to the annual Al Smith dinner in New York City - held virtually this year - Mr Trump said that ""the end of the pandemic is in sight"". This video can not be played ""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" President Trump told a dinner on Thursday He later announced in an interview on Fox News that he and the first lady were being tested for the virus. It is not known how many supporters he came into contact with in recent days, he but told Fox presenter Sean Hannity that people were always wanting to get close to him. ""They want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,"" he said. President Trump announced that he and Mrs Trump had tested positive, adding that they will begin the ""quarantine and recovery process immediately"". Just before 11:00, his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told reporters the president has ""mild symptoms"" but remains in ""good spirits"". Mrs Trump tweeted to say she also had mild symptoms. This video can not be played The president has ""mild symptoms"" but will ""remain on the job"", says White House chief of staff Mark Meadows That day, several other people announce that they've tested positive:Kellyanne Conway, former White House counsellor;Bill Stepien, Mr Trump's campaign manager;Mike Lee, Utah senator;Thom Tillis, a senator for North Carolina;Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee;Rev John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame University; and SenatorRon Johnson, head of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. MeanwhileJoe Biden, the Democrats' presidential candidate, tests negative, as does:Jill Biden, his wife; Vice PresidentMike Penceand his wifeKaren Pence;Kamala Harris, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate;Amy Coney Barrett, Supreme Court nominee;Mike Pompeo, secretary of state;Steve Mnuchin, treasury secretary;Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services;William Barr, attorney general;Ivanka TrumpandDonald Trump Jr, the president's daughter and son; andJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. Former New Jersey governorChris ChristieandNicholas Luna, a White House presidential aide, both test positive. Mr Trump waved to well-wishers from behind the glass of a sealed car after tweeting that he would pay a ""surprise visit"" to ""patriots"" outside the hospital. Inside the car, at least two people could be seen wearing protective gear in the front seats, with Mr Trump sat in the back. There were concerns that the president who wore a mask, may have endangered others inside the car. But White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the trip had been ""cleared by the medical team as safe"". White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnanyannounces on Twitter that she has tested positive.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen spoke via video conference on Saturday Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have ""agreed the importance"" of finding a post-Brexit trade deal, Downing Street has said. They agreed progress has been made in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps"" remain, No 10 said. Both have instructed their chief negotiators to ""work intensively"" in order to try to bridge those gaps. Negotiations between the UK and EU broke up on Friday without agreement. Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and government subsidies. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke during a phone call on Saturday and agreed to speak on a regular basis. A Downing Street spokesperson said the two had agreed on the importance of finding an agreement ""as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future."" The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost,tweeted,externalthat work to resolve differences between the UK and EU ""begins as soon as we can next week"". What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit deal must be made, says business boss Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? Brexit jargon explained Speaking earlier, while on a visit to Leeds, Mr Johnson said he wants adeal like one struck between the EU and Canada, but reiterated the UK was ready should it have to leave without a deal. ""We're resolved on either course, we're prepared for either course and we'll make it work but it's very much up to our friends and partners,"" Mr Johnson said. It comes after Mrs von der Leyen called for talks to ""intensify"", as both sides set an October deadline to settle their differences. The significance of today's call between Boris Johnson and the head of the EU commission is that both sides have agreed to keep talking. Although formal negotiations ended yesterday without agreement, instead of throwing in the sponge - as Boris Johnson would put it - talks will now intensify. But a Downing Street statement made clear that while there are notable (and well-known) differences over fishing rights and subsidies to businesses, these aren't the only issues that need to be solved. There is the potential to compromise - for example, on phasing in new fishing arrangements and on having state aid provisions similar to other free trade agreements - but it's not clear the political willingness is yet there on both sides. The EU has to satisfy the demands of 27 different states. And Boris Johnson has to convince Brexit-supporting backbenchers that he hasn't sold out. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab aimed to reassure them by stating today that the days of being ""held over a barrel"" by Brussels are long gone. Asked about potential compromises that could be made, Mr Johnson said: ""The balance of trade is overwhelmingly on the side of the EU in the sense that they export much more to us than we do to them, certainly in manufacturing goods, and so we think there is a big opportunity for both sides to do well."" He pointed out that Canada is ""some way away"" but had managed to strike a deal with the EU while the UK remained the bloc's biggest trading partner. But he acknowledged a no-deal outcome where the UK would follow mainly World Trade Organization rules on trade with the EU was possible and would ""work very well"" - describing it as anAustralia-style arrangement. Speaking at the virtual Conservative Party conference, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the talks with the EU had been ""a tough process"" but ""with goodwill we should be able to get a deal"". He added: ""Recognising that we share the same high environmental and workforce standards as they do, but we want to do things in our own way, is a bit difficult for them and also there is the very vexed issue to do with fisheries."" However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the conference the ""days of being held over a barrel by Brussels are long gone"", as he stressed any trade deal must be ""fair"". TheEU wants access to UK fishing grounds for its boatsand says reaching a ""fair deal"" is a pre-condition of a deal, while the UK says they should be ""first and foremost for British boats"". The prime minister has set the deadline of the EU Council meeting on 15 October for securing a deal. After six months of trade talks with the EU, Lord Frost has claimed the outlines of an agreement are visible, but he warned that, without further compromise from the EU, differences over the contentious topic of fishing may be impossible to bridge. He described the final round of negotiations as ""constructive"" but ""familiar differences remain"". On fishing, the gap was ""unfortunately very large"" and he called for the EU to ""move further before an understanding can be reached"" on state aid. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, agreed the negotiations had been conducted in a ""constructive and respectful atmosphere"", with some ""positive new developments on some topics"" - such as aviation safety and police co-operation. But he said there was ""a lack of progress on some important topics"", such as climate change commitments, ""as well as persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union"", including state aid and fishing. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost The UK formally left the EU in January, but entered a transition period - where the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - to allow the two sides to negotiate a trade deal. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, but there have been concerns over whether a plan would be agreed before that period runs out on 31 December. Issues that have become particular sticking points between negotiators are state aid - where governments give financial support to businesses - and fishing rules. The EU has said a deal must be reached before the end of October to allow it to be signed off by the member states before the end of the year, while Mr Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if agreement was not reached by the middle of the month. If a deal is not done, the UK will go on to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules.

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".

James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing.
