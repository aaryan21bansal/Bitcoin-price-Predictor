"This video can not be played Footage from the arresting officer's bodycam has been shown to the jury at Mr Stokes' trial. England cricketer Ben Stokes told a court he ""stepped in"" to defend two gay men before an alleged brawl. The Durham all-rounder is one of two men accused of fighting outside a Bristol nightclub on 25 September. Mr Stokes, 27, denies affray and says he acted in self defence. He said he had drunk up to three pints and six vodka and lemonades but was not drunk. Ryan Ali, 28, has also denied affray while Ryan Hale, 27, was acquitted at Bristol Crown Court of affray earlier. Giving evidence for the first time, Mr Stokes told the court he intervened when he heard Mr Hale and Mr Ali ""shouting homophobic comments"" at two gay men, Kai Barry and William O'Connor. He told the jury: ""I stepped in and said 'you shouldn't be saying these things to these two men'."" The prosecution has accused Mr Stokes of mimicking the voices and mannerisms of Mr Barry and Mr O'Connor in what was described as ""a derogatory way"". Mr Stokes was asked by his barrister Gordon Cole QC if any of his actions towards the two gay men outside Mbargo nightclub were homophobic. The cricketer told the court: ""Definitely not. The only comments between myself and this gay couple was about what we was wearing that night."" Prosecutors previously told the court Mr Ali, who they say had been holding a glass beer bottle, and Mr Hale were knocked unconscious by Mr Stokes. Ben Stokes has begun giving evidence in his defence in court When asked what was ""the first action in any violence"" Mr Stokes replied: ""Mr Ali turning the bottle he had. He took the neck of the bottle."" Mr Stokes said he had been ""protecting himself"" and the people around him when he got involved in the fight. He said: ""I took the decision for what I did very quickly. As soon as this episode started I knew not just myself but other people could be a target of these two men. He added: ""As soon as I decided to get involved, everything I did was under self-defence. I did what I could to keep myself and those around me safe."" When asked if he had become ""enraged"" at any point during the incident, Mr Stokes replied it was a ""difficult question to answer"". The 6ft 2in tall sportsman added: ""I didn't know they could be carrying more weapons on them. ""They could decide to attack me at any time if I was to turn my back on either of these two. ""At all times I felt under threat from these two."" Mr Stokes, who was dressed in court in a blue suit, white shirt and blue tie, said that after a win against the West Indies he had celebrated at the ground then had two or three pints with a meal. After the meal, Mr Stokes and some of his England teammates went to Mbargo, where they drank five or six vodka and lemonades. Mr Cole asked: ""Were you drunk?"" ""No,"" Mr Stokes replied. The cricketer said a large group then decided to go to the Pryzm nightclub instead. Mr Cole showed the jury a photograph of Mr Stokes and teammates James Anderson, Jake Ball and Alex Hales taken outside Pryzm. He then returned to Mbargo in a taxi with Mr Hales. Mr Stokes said there was nothing unusual in how he had behaved in his dealings with nightclub doorman Andrew Cunningham. When asked by Mr Cole if he had become enraged at some point, Mr Stokes said: ""No."" He also said he did not remember flicking his cigarette at the gay couple outside the club. Ryan Hale has been found not guilty of affray The court heard earlier that former soldier Mr Hale told police in a formal interview he believed Mr Stokes could have killed him. He added: ""I'm a dad. He could have killed me. I don't know why he didn't stop."" Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, and Mr Ali, of Bristol, both deny a joint charge of affray. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Heavy floods hit southern France Heavy floods have forced the evacuation of 1,600 people - most of them campers - in southern France, officials say. They say a 70-year-old German man who was helping to supervise children at one of the summer camps is missing. The worst-hit areas are Gard, Ardeche and Drome. More than 400 firefighters and police - as well as four helicopters - have been deployed. The storms which caused the floods come after a period of unusually hot weather in southern France and much of Europe. According to UK Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna , almost 3in (8cm) of rain fell in a 24-hour period. In a statement (in French), the French interior ministry said six departments had been placed on a flood alert,,externalwhile about 17,000 homes were without power in the south-west and north-east. Tents were destroyed in the Saint-Julien-de-Peyrolas campsite In one summer camp in Saint-Julien-de-Peyrolas, in the Gard region, 119 children were evacuated.One camper told French network BFMTV they could hear the children's cries,external""in the branches"", but were unable to reach them. The missing German was supervising the children at the camp. Trapped by a fast-flowing torrent, he had sought shelter inside his caravan - but the vehicle was swept away, AFP news agency reports. It was later found ""empty and in pieces"", according to police. Divers were called in as the search operation continued. In pictures: Europe heatwave The side effects of the European heatwave Human actions boosted heatwave odds Regional police spokesman JÃ©rÃ´me Tallaron said 10 people had been taken to hospital with hypothermia and minor injuries, according to the news agency. Harry Ollerton, from Shropshire, in the UK, was camping in the Ardeche when he was woken at 05:00 on Thursday to ""the loudest thunder and brightest flashes of lighting"". ""It didn't let up - the lightning was constant and terrifyingly close to our tent and campsite,"" he told the BBC. ""It passed straight over us, knocking out the power to our pitch and our phone signal suddenly went dead."" A woman surveys the damaged campsite After realising a nearby drainage ditch was overflowing, Mr Ollerton decided it was no longer safe to stay - but even the drive to the nearest town was difficult. ""Village streets had turned into rivers and the rain was so hard that we couldn't barely see out of the window,"" he said. ""Some of the roads were so flooded that they were barely passable. We were lucky to make it out of the area, soaked through but unharmed, by the sound of things."" Rachel Buchanan, from Oxford in the UK, was also camping in the Ardeche when flooding hit. ""We knew a storm was imminent and couldn't believe the ferocity of last night's storm,"" she told the BBC. ""The level and speed of the river today was extraordinary - we woke up in about a foot of water. ""Driving in our camper van was very frightening as the road by the river was completely under water and waterfalls had appeared from nowhere crashing down the gorge.""

"Pupils at Ampleforth (pictured) and Downside were subjected to ""appalling"" sexual abuse over 40 years, the report says Two leading Roman Catholic schools ""prioritised monks and their own reputations over the protection of children"", a report says. ""Appalling"" abuse was inflicted on pupils at Ampleforth in North Yorkshire and Downside in Somerset over 40 years, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said. But, the report said, both institutions attempted to cover up the allegations. Ten individuals, including monks, have been convicted or cautioned for abuse. The report, based on evidence heard by the IICSA's investigation of the Roman Catholic Church and the English Benedictine Congregation, said, however, the true extent of the abuse is ""likely to be considerably higher"" than the number of convictions. It states many of the perpetrators did not hide their sexual interests from the children and pupils were often abused in front of each other. ""The blatant openness of the activities demonstrates there was a culture of acceptance of abusive behaviour,"" it said. The scale and nature of the abuse inflictedis contained in the full report published on Thursday.,external(WARNING: Contains distressing detail). Both Ampleforth and Downside Abbey, near Radstock, have affiliated schools within their grounds where fees range from Â£16,000 to Â£35,000 per year. Ampleforth teacher David Lowe carried out the crimes at two schools more than 30 years ago Professor Alexis Jay, chairwoman of the inquiry, said: ""For decades Ampleforth and Downside tried to avoid giving any information about child sexual abuse to police and social services. ""Instead, monks in both institutions were very often secretive, evasive and suspicious of anyone outside the English Benedictine Congregation. ""Safeguarding children was less important than the reputation of the church and the wellbeing of the abusive monks."" She said the institutions continued to try to manage internally allegations of abuse despite recommendations in the 2001 Nolan Report they should be referred to statutory authorities. Manager drafted in at 'abuse' college Priest 'tried to control' abuse inquiry Boy 'abused' by head of Catholic school ""Even after new procedures were introduced in 2001, when monks gave the appearance of co-operation and trust, their approach could be summarised as a 'tell them nothing' attitude."" One former Downside pupil, who tried to speak out at the the time about his abuse said he was made to feel like a ""sinner"". ""I was vulnerable, broken and needed help from the church when I was a child,"" he said. ""I trusted them to help, but instead my life was destroyed and I was handed a life sentence of suffering by my abuser and those who failed to act against it."" Perpetrators from the two schools who were convicted include Ampleforth teachers David Lowe and Piers Grant-Ferris and former Downside geography teacher Richard White, known as Father Nicholas. Richard David White taught at Downside School in the 1980s Lowe, who also taught at Westminster Cathedral Choir School, was convicted of assaulting boys aged from eight to 13 between 1978 and 1984. He was jailed in 2015 for 10 years. The inquiry heard that when abuse committed by White came to light he was moved from the junior to the senior school where he was given the role of housemaster to his first victim. The report said: ""The abuse of a second victim could have been prevented if the abbot and the headmaster had referred the first abuse to the police and social services."" White was jailed in 2012 for five years. Prof Alexis Jay was appointed in 2016 and is the fourth person to chair the inquiry The inquiry heard both institutions were ""hostile"" to the recommendations of the Nolan report, taking the view its implementation was ""neither obligatory nor desirable"". ""For much of the time under consideration by the inquiry, the overriding concern in both Ampleforth and Downside was to avoid contact with the local authority or the police at all costs, regardless of the seriousness of the alleged abuse or actual knowledge of its occurrence,"" it said. The inquiry also heard that in about 2012 then headmaster of Downside, Dom Leo Maidlow Davies, burned wheelbarrows full of files from the school. The report said while it was ""impossible to say"" what information was in the documents ""it adds to the perception of a cover-up on the part of Downside"". It said a ""strict separation"" between the governance of the school and the abbey was needed in order to safeguard pupils in future and while Ampleforth had taken steps to do just that Downside still had not. LBC radio presenter James O'Brien, who was a pupil at Ampleforth,told BBC Radio 4's World at One the monks wielded a ""secular and spiritual power""that could have played a part in the abuse being hidden for so long. Pupils at Downside School pay up to Â£11,000 per term Both Downside and Ampleforth have issued statements apologising to the victims. ""The Abbey and School fully acknowledges the serious failings and mistakes made in both protecting those within our care and responding to safeguarding concerns,"" a Downside spokesman said. ""We have reflected deeply and will continue to listen with the ear of the heart going forward to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated."" A spokesman for Ampleforth said it had publicly accepted responsibility for ""past failings on many occasions"". ""The Ampleforth of today has never been afraid to learn difficult lessons,"" he said. ""We remain completely focused on the safety and wellbeing of those entrusted to our care and our commitment to implement meaningful change."" Father Christopher Jamison, Abbot President of the English Benedictine Congregation, said the report highlighted ""how flawed many of our past responses have been"". He said: ""Once again I apologise unequivocally to all those who were abused by any person connected with our abbeys and schools."" Richard Scorer, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon who represented victims from both schools at the inquiry, said: ""The abhorrent and disgraceful abuse in the Catholic Church has once again been laid bare by this inquiry. ""This familiar and shameful story of cover-up has been told time and time again, and is a devastating indictment of an organisation guilty of gross failures on child protection. ""It is clear the Catholic Church is woefully incapable of policing itself. ""That is why we urgently need a mandatory reporting law to prevent the perpetuation of the abuse of vulnerable children."" Asked if he thought institutions like Ampleforth and Downside could continue in the wake of the report, the inquiry's secretary John O'Brien said: ""You're not going to survive if you don't recognise that you need to change. ""From where I sit right now we've heard no evidence that those changes are happening, even now we still don't have separation of the governance at Downside.""

"Net migration targets should be scrapped after Brexit, the Confederation of British Industry says. Targets should be replaced with a system that ensures people coming to the UK make a positive contribution to the economy, the business group said. Schools and hospitals should receive extra funding where demand is increased by immigration, the CBI added. But the Home Office said it was committed to bringing net migration down to ""tens of thousands"". The contribution of EU workers to the UK economy was ""profoundly important and will be needed in the future"", after the free movement of EU citizens comes to an end as part of Brexit, the CBI said. It said EU citizens should be registered on arrival to the UK and restrict their visit to three months ""unless they can prove that they are working, studying or are self-sufficient"". It would be ""entirely unworkable"" to move EU nationals into the existing non-EU immigration system, which the CBI described as ""highly complex, time-consuming and expensive, particularly for small businesses"". European fruit pickers shun Britain Construction bodies warn of Brexit 'cliff edge' skills gap Carney: No-deal Brexit risk 'uncomfortably high' The CBI said immigration had been shown time and again to bring net economic benefits to the UK, yet people had legitimate concerns about the pressures immigration could have on public services and society. The answer was to shift away from numbers and instead to focus on who could benefit the UK. This need not just be high earners, but anyone who could contribute. There is an impetus to overhaul UK immigration policy after Brexit to make sure the system allows skilled people to come into the country from around the world, the CBI said. ""The stakes are high. Get it wrong, and the UK risks having too few people to run the health service, pick food crops or deliver products to stores around the country,"" it added. ""We also risk harming our future as a global innovation hub, rooted in our longstanding ability to attract talented people the world over."" However, the Home Office said it had no plans to scrap immigration targets. The target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands was set by David Cameron in 2010. But the goal has never been met, with recent annual net migration to the UK at about 240,000. There is ""no consent in Britain for uncontrolled immigration"", the Home Office said. ""After we leave the EU, we will end free movement and put in place a system which works in the best interests of the whole of the UK,"" the Home Office said. ""We are considering a range of options that will ensure that we are in control of our borders and managing migration, while continuing to attract and retain people who come here to work and bring significant benefits."" The government has asked the Migration Advisory Committee, a non-departmental public body, to assess the contribution that EU citizens make to the UK. The body has been talking to businesses, the NHS and universities, and is due to bring out a report in September. The government will then set out its plans, taking into account ""the UK's social and economic circumstances and our discussions with the EU around our future relationship"", the Home Office said. The department added that the government had already reached agreements on EU citizens' rights, while its White Paper proposed visa-free travel for tourists and short-term business travellers.

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties At least 29 children have been killed and 30 wounded in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in Yemen, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The children were travelling on a bus that was hit at a market in Dahyan, in the northern province of Saada. The health ministry run by the rebel Houthi movement put the death toll at 43, and said 61 people were wounded. The coalition, which is backing Yemen's government in a war with the Houthis, said its actions were ""legitimate"". It insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. Meanwhile the new UN special envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, is planning to invite the warring parties to Geneva in September to discuss a framework for negotiations. This video can not be played UN envoy Martin Griffiths says that if peace efforts in Yemen fail, the world could be looking at âSyria-plus"". He told the BBC's Lyse Doucet that if the conflict is left unresolved, Yemen could collapse and the international community could be looking at ""Syria-plus"" in the years to come. ""The war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even more than it is now."" Yemeni tribal elders told the Associated Press that the bus was hit as it passed through Dahyan market,externaland that it was transporting local civilians, including many school children. The charity Save the Children said it had been told by its staff that the children were on their way back to school from a picnic,externalwhen the driver of their bus stopped to get a drink. The vehicle was stationary when the attack happened, it added. The ICRC said it was sending extra supplies to help hospitals deal with the influx The ICRC said a hospital it supported in Saada had received the bodies of 29 children,external, all of them under the age of 15, and 48 injured people, among them 30 children. It sent additional supplies to the hospital to cope with the influx of patients. Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that 47 people were killed and 77 wounded, and broadcast graphic pictures showing the bodies of several young children, some of them wearing school uniform. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam accused the coalition of showing ""clear disregard for civilian life"" by targeting a crowded public place. Allow Twitter content?

The ICRC stressed that ""under international humanitarian law, civilians must be protected during conflict"", whilethe secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland called it a ""grotesque, shameful"" attack,externalthat showed ""blatant disregard for rules of war"". Save the Children described the incident as ""horrific"", and called for a full, immediate and independent investigation into recent attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. It was not immediately clear whether the bus was the target of the air strike, butcoalition spokesman Col Turki al-Malki said the attack was ""a legitimate military action,external, conducted in conformity with international humanitarian law"". Air strikes were reported in the rebel-held capital of Sanaa later on Thursday He said it had hit ""militants responsible for planning and targeting civilians"" in the southern Saudi city of Jizan on Wednesday night, where one Yemeni resident was killed and 11 others were injured by fragments from an intercepted ballistic missile that was launched by the Houthis from neighbouring Amran province. He accused the rebels of using children as ""tools and covers for their terrorist acts"". Later, air strikes were reported in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa. A week ago, at least 55 civilians were killed and 170 others wounded in a series of attacks on the rebel-held Red Sea port city of Hudaydah. The coalition denied that it had carried out air strikes in the area, and blamed the deaths on rebel mortar fire. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

"The three clay cones are identified as coming from a temple in southern Iraq Eight 5,000-year-old artefacts looted from Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein will be returned after being identified by the British Museum. The objects were seized by police from a now-defunct London dealer in 2003. The collection has spent 15 years in the hands of the state but has now been established as being from a site in Tello in southern Iraq. The items, which include a marble bull pendant, will be presented to the Iraqi embassy in London on Friday. The British Museum's director Hartwig Fischer said the organisation was ""absolutely committed to the fight against illicit trade and damage to cultural heritage"". Artefacts worth â¬40m recovered in raids across Europe US returns 'looted' royal seals to South Korea after 60 years Germany returns 3,000-year-old Olmec statues to Mexico Three cones bearing Sumerian cuneiform script were found All of the items date back to 3000BC The head of a mace - a type of weapon - was among the items found In addition to the bull pendant, the collection - which dates back to 3000BC - includes a gypsum mace head, two stamp seals, an inscribed pebble and three clay cones bearing Sumerian cuneiform script. None of the items were accompanied by documentation when first discovered in England by the Metropolitan Police - and the dealer they were taken from made no attempt to reclaim them. After years in police storage, the collection was taken to the British Museum in 2018. By reading the inscriptions on the items, museum experts were able to determine not just which site they belonged to, but also which parts of specific building remains they came from. The cone inscriptions bore the name of the Sumerian king who commissioned them, the temple they came from and the god the temple was dedicated to. Stamp seals were among the collection An inscribed river pebble will also be returned The items will be presented to the Iraqi ambassador on Friday Following a presentation ceremony involving the British Museum and Iraqi ambassador to the UK, the antiquities will be returned to Baghdad next week. Iraq's ambassador to the UK, Dr Salih Husain Ali, said he wanted to express his ""thanks and appreciation"" to the museum, adding that cooperation between the two countries was ""vital for the preservation and the protection of the Iraqi heritage"".

"This video can not be played Everton signing Mina's three World Cup goals Everton, Fulham and Leicester all made big-money signings as the earliest transfer deadline in Premier League history came to life late in the day. However, the amount spent in the window by Premier League clubs fell for the first time in eight years, to Â£1.2bn. Tottenham and Manchester United made no signings on 9 August. Spurs became the first Premier League club to not make a summer signing since the current transfer window system was adopted in 2003. The deadline was moved from 31 August to the day before the Premier League season starts after a vote by clubs. Listen: Football Daily - the big transfer deadline day pod Yerry Mina's Â£27m move to Evertonfrom Barcelona was the day's big transfer. The deadline also applied to English Football League clubs - although they can still sign free agents and loan players until 31 August. Premier League and EFL clubs voted - although not unanimously - to close the transfer market earlier this season to avoid disruption to the opening weeks of the season. However, it was only introduced in England, with Spanish, German, French and Scottish clubs able to sign players until the end of the month. Italy has a deadline of Friday, 17 August - the day before Serie A starts. Players could still leave the Premier League - with Chelsea's Eden Hazard a reported target for Spanish giants Real Madrid, although the Blues would then not be able to sign a replacement. Deadline day as it happened If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please clickhere,externalto vote. As well as the earlier-than-usual date, the deadline also closed earlier in the day - 17:00 BST compared to the usual 23:00. It looked as if this was going to be the quietest final day since the window was introduced in 2003 - with only eight signings confirmed by Premier League clubs before 17:00. The highest-profile deal at that stage was midfielder Mateo Kovacic joining Chelsea on loan from Real Madrid - with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtoisgoing the other way permanently. But clubs had another two hours after the deadline to finalise paperwork - during which Everton signed Colombia defender Mina and midfielder Andre Gomes on loan from Barcelona - having signed free agent Bernard earlier in the day. The Toffees announced the loan signing of Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma the following day. Fulham announced five players, all after the deadline- Marseille midfielder Andre-Frank Anguissa in a Â£22.3m deal, Bristol City left-back Joe Bryan for Â£6m and Sergio Rico, Luciano Vietto and Timothy Fosu-Mensah on loan. That made them the first promoted team ever to spend over Â£100m in the summer. AndLeicester City confirmed the signingof Freiburg and Turkey defender Caglar Soyuncu, in a deal thought to be worth up to Â£19m. Earlier on, they had bought defender Filip Benkovic from Dinamo Zagreb for a reported Â£13m. The top 10 Premier League signings of the transfer window (based on initial transfer fees) Check out all the deadline day moves here Some other moves included Danny Ings joining Southampton from Liverpool on a loan which will become permanent next summer, Jordan Ayew moving to Crystal Palace from Swansea for a season and West Ham signing Arsenal striker Lucas Perez and Fiorentina midfielder Carlos Sanchez. This video can not be played Tottenham will be competitive - Pochettino Six clubs did not sign anybody on Thursday. Tottenham arereported,externalto be the first Premier League club to not sign a single player in a summer transfer window, although bossMauricio Pochettino said he was not disappointed,with only two youngsters leaving the club. ""It's difficult to understand for people that Tottenham didn't sign or sell a player, but sometimes in football you need to behave differently and we're happy with our squad,"" he said. Manchester United only signed three players all summer - all by early July. But they did also try to sign a centre-back and manager Jose Mourinho said on Sunday they faced a ""difficult season"" if they could not sign anyone else. They had been linked with Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld, Leicester's Harry Maguire and Bayern Munich's Jerome Boateng over the summer. And the Red Devils made a dramatic late approach for Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin - but he is now expected to sign a new deal with the Spanish club. Spurs were one of 14 clubs to vote for the earlier deadline last September, with United voting against it. Arsenal and Liverpool were among the other clubs not to sign anybody - but they were not expected to, having each made several signings earlier this summer. Club-by-club guide to Premier League transfers Figures released by Deloitte say summer spending dropped by Â£200m from last year's record of Â£1.4bn - and deadline-day spending was only just over half the 2017 total - Â£110m, down from Â£210m. But Premier League clubs spent a record Â£880m to bring in players from foreign leagues - compared to Â£770m last summer. That was 72% of all money spent by English top-flight clubs - last year's figure was 54%. Tim Bridge, director in the sports business group at Deloitte, said: ""Premier League clubs' gross player transfer expenditure of Â£1.2bn continues to demonstrate the sheer purchasing power of the most commercially successful football league in the world. ""With Premier League clubs' aggregate revenues forecast to reach Â£5bn in 2018-19, clubs can well afford to significantly invest in on-pitch talent in the quest for both success and survival."" Some other findings included: The next highest spending league is Serie A, with a reported gross spend of about Â£910m (including Â£99m Cristiano Ronaldo), followed by La Liga (Â£680m), the Bundesliga (Â£400m) and Ligue 1 (Â£350m) - but none of their windows have closed yet Championship clubs spent Â£155m on transfers - a decrease from the Â£195m spent last summer The Premier League's highest-spending clubs were Liverpool (Â£165m), Chelsea (Â£120m), Fulham (Â£105m) and Leicester City (Â£100m) Only three clubs received more transfer fees than they spent - Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and Watford * this year's figure of 25 excludes Everton's signing of Kurt Zouma which they announced on Friday The flurry of late deals took deadline day above last year's total of 17 transfers - to 26 (including Zouma's Everton move on Friday), the highest amount since 2013 - but the total number of transfers in the window fell for the fifth year in a row. Until the late rush, it had appeared it was going to the the quietest summer deadline day in Premier League history. Football finance expert Rob Wilson of Sheffield Hallam University said: ""Clubs invested heavily last year when we saw almost Â£1.5bn being spent. Without a new TV deal that increases the amount of cash available, this window was always due to plateau. ""That, plus excessive fees being quoted, has probably restricted what some clubs are prepared to pay. Manchester United, for example, have spent much more modestly and would normally contribute to the overall total. I suspect that is due to clubs increasing their prices as the world's richest club came knocking and United simply refused to be held to ransom."" Wilson thinks Neymar's Â£200m world record move from Barcelona to Paris St-Germain last summer helped change the transfer market. ""It does seem to have shifted the market up, especially after Philippe Coutinho moved for Â£140m+ from Liverpool to Barcelona. It's meant fees in general have essentially doubled from what would have been expected before the last TV deal. It's indicative of fewer signings but higher fees too."" The rise in prices is backed up by the transfer fees previously paid for this summer's top 10 Premier League signings, with none of them costing more than Â£13m when they were last signed.

"This video can not be played The video game that's actually dementia research Men are better at navigating than women, according to a massive study, but there's not much for men to be proud about. Scientists at University College London say the difference has more to do with discrimination and unequal opportunities than any innate ability. The findings come from research into a test for dementia. But it has also given an unprecedented insight into people's navigational ability all around the world. The experiment is actually a computer game,Sea Hero Quest,external, that has had more than four million players. It's a nautical adventure to save an old sailor's lost memories and with a touch of a smartphone screen, you chart a course round desert islands and icy oceans. The game anonymously records the player's sense of direction and navigational ability. One clear picture, published in the journal Current Biology, was that men were better at navigating than women. But why? Prof Hugo Spiers thinks he has found the answer by looking at data from the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index - which studies equality in areas from education to health and jobs to politics. He told the BBC: ""We don't think the effects we see are innate. ""So countries where there is high equality between men and women, the difference between men and women is very small on our spatial navigation test. ""But when there's high inequality the difference between men and women is much bigger. And that suggests the culture people are living in has an effect on their cognitive abilities."" Women won't have equality for 100 years Sea Hero Quest has produced a raft of other findings. Denmark, Finland and Norway have the world's best navigational skills - possibly down to their ""Viking blood"" Sense of direction is in constant decline after you emerge from your teenage years People in wealthier countries also tend to be the best navigators The deeper the colour, the stronger the country's navigational ability The popularity of the game has turned it into the world's biggest dementia research experiment. Being lost or disoriented is one of the first signs of the disease. The next step in the research is to see if catching sudden declines in navigational ability could be used to test for dementia. Tim Parry, the director of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The data from Sea Hero Quest is providing an unparalleled benchmark for how human navigation varies and changes across age, location and other factors. ""This really is only the beginning of what we might learn about navigation from this powerful analysis."" This project was funded by Deutsche Telekom and the game was designed by Glitchers.

"Northamptonshire County Council approved an action plan for ""radical"" cuts to services A cash-strapped council has approved massive cuts to jobs and services in a bid to tackle a Â£70m funding shortfall. Northamptonshire County Council backed theaction plan to reduce spendingduring a crisis meeting. Children's services, road maintenance and waste management are among the areas facing ""radical"" cuts. Council leader, Conservative Matt Golby, described it as ""the most challenging thing me and my colleagues have ever been faced with"". All but one of the Conservative councillors backed the action plan earlier, while opposition groups voted against. Reality Check: What do councils have to do? The council will now work out what impact this will have on individual services and jobs. The governmentsent in commissioners to oversee Northamptonshirein April after the authority revealed a projected overspend of Â£21m for 2017-18. However, the authority was forced to issue a second spending control order to stave off a projected budget shortfall of Â£60m-Â£70m this financial year. About 20 people gathered outside County Hall to protest against cuts Liberal Democrat councillor Dennis Meredith criticised the fact the Whitehall commissioners are being paid Â£1,500 a day - with the cash-strapped council allegedly picking up the bill. ""I think that's a scandal,"" he said. ""We need to send you back to London. It's only 60 miles."" A small group gathered outside County Hall ahead of the meeting to protest against the cuts, including Alvarez Wilkinson from the Unison union in Northamptonshire. He said: ""We'll be losing a lot of staff and, when you lose a member of staff, you also lose a service. Some messages of protest were chalked outside where the meeting was being held ""I live in the county and as services disappear, I really worry about the welfare of my family."" As it started, a member of the public blasted the Tory councillors who were not present -a total of 15 failed to attend the meeting. Bianca Todd said: ""There are county councillors who are not here today. You have got to be kidding me. We're making national news. ""When people die this winter, because they will die this winter, the blood will be on your hands."" The story behind the cash-crisis council Cash-crisis council: Your thoughts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? Jenny Cotton-Howells from Spectrum, a charity supporting people with learning difficulties, said she was ""worried"" about further cuts to services but ""had faith"" in the council to make ""the right decisions"". She added: ""Any further cuts would be absolutely catastrophic. They cannot cut an already cut service to the bone."" Summarising the debate, Mr Golby vowed to ""not put people at risk"". ""That's not what we're about. We're not going to give up,"" he said. ""We have got to make sure that we provide the services we can. We will meet our statutory duties and I'm happy to say that. ""Do we understand the implications? Yes."" This video can not be played New mother Rachael Ball says she worries over plans to close 21 libraries in Northamptonshire Chief finance officer Mark McLaughlin told the meeting the council ""cannot continue to spend money it doesn't have"" and admitted some previous actions were ""clearly wrong"", but he said the challenge could be ""turned into a success"". Labour group leader Bob Scott said past decisions had been ""catastrophic"" and his group would not vote to harm the people of Northamptonshire, while Lib Dem group leader Chris Stanbra said there were ""unanswered questions"" about ""who knew what and when"" during the crisis. Speaking after the meeting, Northampton South MP Andrew Lewer said it was vital to ""change the relationship between Westminster, Whitehall and local government"" in future. He recognised ""local mismanagement"" was to blame for the council's situation but said it should serve as ""a warning not just for Northamptonshire, but for the rest of the country"". In Tory mythology it is free-spending ""loony left"" Labour councils that get into financial difficulties, not prudent Conservative ones. The reality has never been quite like that. The last time a council went bankrupt, in Hackney, East London, in 2000, it was run by a Labour/Tory coalition. But there is more to the Northamptonshire County Council crisis than embarrassment for Theresa May's government - although that is acute enough, given that the council stuck rigidly to the government's spending guidelines. Local councils have borne the brunt of austerity, with central government funding falling by about half since 2010. If, as some predict, it is not the last council to go under, this will become a national crisis, not a local one, something Labour has been predicting for a long time.

These reserves are sometimes seen as ""rainy day"" funds. They are there for unplanned expenses or planned one-off costs. They do not get topped back up again unless the council finds the money from somewhere else. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""The financial challenges facing Northamptonshire council are clearly serious and reinforce how important it was that we took swift action to appoint commissioners.

"This video can not be played Lucy McHugh was seen at Tesco Express half an hour after she left home Murder detectives investigating the death of teenager Lucy McHugh have asked Facebook to ""preserve"" information on some users' accounts. The 13-year-old's body was found in woodland near Southampton Sports Centre early on 26 July. Facebook said it was ""working directly with Hampshire police on this case"". As a US-based company, access to private information on the social network must be requested through the US courts system. Last week a 24-year-old man was charged with withholding information relating the case by allegedly failing to disclose his Facebook password to police. Hampshire Constabulary said that in a move separate to the charge, it had asked the social media website to save information on ""relevant accounts"". Lucy left her home in Mansel Road East on 25 July but did not return home The Crimestoppers charity has offered a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for Lucy's death. Spokeswoman Emily van der Lely said: ""I can't even begin to imagine what Lucy went through and the suffering her family are currently experiencing. ""This is why our charity is putting up this money, in the hope we can bring the person or people to justice."" Police aresifting through 15,000 hours of CCTV footage. On Tuesday, images were released showing Lucy passing a Tesco Express store on the corner of Coxford Road and Lordswood Road at 09:30 BST on 25 July. The footage was captured half an hour after she left her home in Mansel Road East for the final time, and half a mile from where her body was found. Police released images of clothing worn by Lucy McHugh when she went missing A 24-year-old man arrested last week on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child was bailed on the condition he did not enter Southampton. The same man appeared in court on 31 July charged with withholding information relating to the murder investigation.

"Bonobos are the non-human primates with the most extensive vocal repertoire Our primate cousins have surprised and impressed scientists in recent years, withrevelations about monkeys' tool-using abilitiesand chimps'development of complex sign language. But researchers are still probing the question: why are we humans the only apes that can talk? That puzzle has now led to an insight into how different non-human primates' brains are ""wired"" for vocal ability. A new study has compared different primate species' brains. It revealed that primates with wider ""vocal repertoires"" had more of their brain dedicated to controlling their vocal apparatus. That suggests that our own speaking skills may have evolved as our brains gradually rewired to control that apparatus, rather than purely because we're smarter than non-human apes. Humans and other primates have very similar vocal anatomy - in terms of their tongues and larynx. That's the physical machinery in the throat which allows us to turn air into sound. So, as lead researcher Dr Jacob Dunn from Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge explained, it remains a mystery that only human primates can actually talk. ""That's likely due to differences in the brain,"" Dr Dunn told BBC News, ""but there haven't been comparative studies across species."" That comparison is exactly what Dr Dunn and his colleague Prof Jeroen Smaers set out to do. They ranked 34 different primate species based on their vocal abilities - the number of distinct calls they are known to make in the wild. They then examined the brain of each species, using information from existing, preserved brains that had been kept for research. ""It turns out there's this signature within the brains of primates that relates directly to their vocal repertoire,"" said Dr Dunn. Proboscis monkeys have only four known vocalisations Bottom of his ranked list of primates was the proboscis monkey, with four known distinct calls. The apes - led by the bonobo - were at the top; bonobos make 38 distinct calls and it has been suggested that theiruse of vocalisations are a glimpse of the early evolution of language. These more vocally adept apes, the study revealed, had relatively large areas of the brain known as cortical association areas - essentially brain regions which receive sensory input and decide what to do with it. ""They're a kind of filter to control the decision-making process,"" explained Dr Dunn. Also, and perhaps most importantly, bonobos and the other more vocal apes - including chimpanzees - had much larger parts of the brain dedicated to control of the tongue. This suggests, the researchers say, that while our primate cousins may well be sufficiently smart to develop and understand complex ways of communicating, the voluntary control of their ""vocal apparatus"" - rather than their intelligence - is the limiting factor. Since we cannot study our extinct human ancestors, scientists all over the world still look to our closest primate cousins to fill the gaps in our knowledge about the evolution of something as complex and crucial to humanity as language. Understanding how the brain is wired in these different primate species and how that relates to vocal ability, could, suggested Dr Dunn, ""go some way to helping us understand how the complex voluntary control over vocal production may have evolved in humans,"" ultimately leading to our own ability to speak. But researchers studying the origins of speech and language still have questions. Prof Zanna Clay from Durham University is currently in Congo continuing her extensive study of bonobos. She told BBC News that this particular study was interesting, but cautioned that a much more basic understanding of how exactly primates themselves use and understand their vocalisations was needed before conclusions like these could be confirmed. ""We do not even really understand how the primates themselves classify their own vocal repertoires - this needs to come first before correlations are made,"" she said.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 aims to make it easier to take good snaps Samsung's new high-end smartphone alerts owners to problems with their photos as soon as they are snapped. The Galaxy Note 9 uses software to identify if the images are blurry or whether the subject is blinking, among other issues. The innovation is one of several artificial intelligence-enhanced abilities the handset offers that do not rely on remote computer servers. Analysts say this should help tackle increasing competition from Huawei. The Chinese rival made much of itsown flagship phone's machine learning abilitieswhen it launched in March. The Note 9's other new features include a stylus that wirelessly communicates with the phone to act as a remote control. Its display and battery are also bigger than earlier models. The stylus now works as a remote control It goes on sale on 24 August. The basic model will cost Â£899, while a version with more storage and memory will be Â£1,099. Note 9's S Pen doubles as a selfie stick Why is Samsung's Galaxy S9 struggling? Huawei P20 Pro 'sees in the dark' The New York launch comes just over a week after Samsung revealed that sales of its other high-end smartphone - the Galaxy S9 - had disappointed. It acknowledged at the time that the Note 9's release had beenbrought forward as a consequence,external. ""Samsung will be mindful to criticism that the S9 offered iterative improvements to the S8,"" commented Shaun Collins, chief executive of the CCS Insight consultancy. ""For existing Note users - who are fiercely loyal to the devices - the upgrades will be seen as compelling. ""But the jury is still out on whether people considering an alternative product, such as the iPhone or P20 Pro, will feel this is different enough to bring them across."" Samsung also revealed that a tie-up with games developer Epic meant thatexisting Galaxy phones,externalare the first Android devices to get access to the hit game Fortnite. Note 9 owners are promised access to an exclusive Fortnite outfit They can download a beta version of the game now ahead of it rolling out to other devices later this week. A Galaxy Home smart speaker powered by the firm's virtual assistant Bixby was also unveiled, in addition to a 4G-enabled smartwatch powered by the firm's Tizen operating system. Samsung has shipped nearly 143 million Galaxy Note handsets since the product line launched in 2011, according to market research firm IDC. That represents about 7% of all the smartphones it has delivered over the period, but their premium prices mean they have accounted for 10% of revenues. Source: IDC * Based on preliminary data for April-to-June 2018 Photo review The Note 9 makes use of a rear dual aperture camera - which adjusts how much light gets in - in a similar manner to the S9. But its software is now smarter. The Note 9 was unveiled at an event in New York The Flaw Detection facility warns when: images appear out of focus it detects a smudge on the lens the lighting is bad the subject has their eyes shut In addition, Scene Optimiser algorithms attempt to identify the contents of the scene. If they succeed,  one of 20 sets of adjustments are made to tweak the contrast, colour and other settings. A on-screen alert will warn users if there is a problem with an image None of this requires an internet connection. ""It was really important that Samsung did this on the device because it makes it faster and more secure,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC. ""But I was expecting to see even greater use of AI, and to me this seems like Samsung is catching up with Huawei rather than going beyond."" Samsung did, however, demo new capabilities for its smart assistant Bixby. These included the ability to handle follow-up questions during a conversation, and integration with Google Maps. The new S Pen is the first to include Bluetooth connectivity. This means that in addition to being a stylus, it acts as a remote control. The new S Pen can be recharged by putting it back in the phone It can be used to trigger selfies, play and pause YouTube clips, and move along PowerPoint slides. In addition, Samsung is making it possible for other app developers to make use of the functionality. Mr Jeronimo was more positive about the impact this would have. ""The targeted corporate and professional users will appreciate being able to control presentations remotely,"" he explained. ""Many will now be able to do without a laptop."" Samsung says the S Pen will make it easier to take selfies Although the device looks similar to its predecessor,  the Note 9 is slightly wider and thicker. This allows it to have a slightly bigger 6.4in (16.3cm) display and a 4,000mAh battery - representing 21% more capacity than the Note 8. A more expensive variant is also offered this time round, with 8 gigabytes rather than 6GB of RAM (random-access memory) and 512GB instead of 128GB of internal storage. The firm added that its proprietary CPU (central processing unit) was 33% faster than before. This is likely to appeal to hardcore gamers and other power users if they can justify the cost. Samsung also provided a brief first look at the forthcoming Galaxy Home smart speaker. Samsung has promised to reveal more details about the Galaxy Home at a later event It said the voice-controlled device would direct audio at owners via a technology it called SoundSteer, and added that the device included eight microphones to detect voices - more than Amazon's Echo, Google's Home Max or Apple's HomePod. Samsung said that it had partnered with Spotify to provide a streamed music service but did not reveal if other options would be available. Allow Twitter content?

"Protesters gathered in Uxbridge, Mr Johnson's constituency, on Thursday Boris Johnson is facing a possible investigation into breaches of the Conservative Party code of conduct. The party has received dozens of complaints about the ex-foreign secretary's comments about Muslim women wearing burkas. The complaints will be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. The party declined to comment on the details of the investigation. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""The code of conduct process is strictly confidential.""  A source close to Mr Johnson offered no comment. Meanwhile more than 30 protesters have gathered in Mr Johnson's constituency of Uxbridge, calling for his resignation. Mr Johnson has rejected calls to apologise for saying people wearing burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"", ina Daily Telegraph column,externalin which he also argued against a ban on full-face veils. Critics have accused him of stoking Islamophobia to boost his Tory leadership ambitions but his supporters have said he was speaking up for ""liberal values"". It comes as a watchdog which advises ex-ministers on taking new jobs ruled that Mr Johnson broke ministerial rules by taking up his weekly column at the Telegraph without consulting it first. Johnson's Telegraph contract broke rules Criticism grows of Johnson's burka jibe Why some Muslim women wear the veil The Conservative Party has been accused of not doing enough to tackle anti-Muslim prejudice in its ranks, despite an initiative to boost tolerance and diversity. Theparty's code of conduct,externalstates that Tory officials and elected representatives must ""lead by example to encourage and foster respect and tolerance"" and not ""use their position to bully, abuse, victimise, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others"". The independent panel will decide whether to refer Mr Johnson to the party's board. Possible action includes suspension of membership or expulsion from the party among other, lesser sanctions. Cressida Dick: Johnson did not commit an offence Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and leader Theresa May have both called on Mr Johnson to apologise for his comments. The founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Lord Sheikh, has written to Mr Lewis demanding ""serious action"", while former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became prime minister. A hundred Muslim women who wear the niqab or burka have signed a letter to Mr Lewis, calling on him to withdraw the Conservative whip from Mr Johnson and launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. ""We are not forced to make these clothing choices, nor are we oppressed,"" the women write in their letter, which has been issued to the media by the Muslim Council of Britain. They say Mr Johnson's words will ""inflame tensions in a way that makes it easier for bigots to justify hate crimes against us"". Azmat Parveen, who attended the protest in Uxbridge on Thursday, called Mr Johnson's comments ""painful"". ""This is a way of life, I want to choose this way and somebody remarks on it, I can't bear it, it is very, very rude,"" the 68-year-old said. ""I want him to leave his seat."" Earlier, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said that while many have found Mr Johnson's remarks offensive, officers had decided that he did not commit an offence. She also confirmed that police have not received any criminal complaint against the former foreign secretary. ""I also know that many other people believe strongly that in the whole of the article, what Mr Johnson appears to have been attempting to do was to say that there shouldn't be a ban and that he was engaging in a legitimate debate,"" she added. Asked what she made of the language used by the ex-cabinet minister, Ms Dick told the BBC Asian Network: ""Some people have clearly found it offensive. ""I spoke last night to my very experienced officers who deal with hate crime and, although we have not yet received any allegation of such a crime, I can tell you that my preliminary view having spoken to them is that what Mr Johnson said would not reach the bar for a criminal offence. He did not commit a criminal offence."" She added: ""I am proud to police in a liberal democracy in which people have the right to express their opinions. ""What Mr Johnson said, if it is not criminal, is a matter for Mr Johnson and his friends and colleagues and indeed for the Conservative Party."" The police and Crown Prosecution Service define a hate crime as ""any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, based on a person's disability or perceived disability; race or perceived race; or religion or perceived religion; or sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation or transgender identity or perceived transgender identity"".

"This video can not be played Heavy floods hit southern France Heavy floods have forced the evacuation of 1,600 people - most of them campers - in southern France, officials say. They say a 70-year-old German man who was helping to supervise children at one of the summer camps is missing. The worst-hit areas are Gard, Ardeche and Drome. More than 400 firefighters and police - as well as four helicopters - have been deployed. The storms which caused the floods come after a period of unusually hot weather in southern France and much of Europe. According to UK Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna , almost 3in (8cm) of rain fell in a 24-hour period. In a statement (in French), the French interior ministry said six departments had been placed on a flood alert,,externalwhile about 17,000 homes were without power in the south-west and north-east. Tents were destroyed in the Saint-Julien-de-Peyrolas campsite In one summer camp in Saint-Julien-de-Peyrolas, in the Gard region, 119 children were evacuated.One camper told French network BFMTV they could hear the children's cries,external""in the branches"", but were unable to reach them. The missing German was supervising the children at the camp. Trapped by a fast-flowing torrent, he had sought shelter inside his caravan - but the vehicle was swept away, AFP news agency reports. It was later found ""empty and in pieces"", according to police. Divers were called in as the search operation continued. In pictures: Europe heatwave The side effects of the European heatwave Human actions boosted heatwave odds Regional police spokesman JÃ©rÃ´me Tallaron said 10 people had been taken to hospital with hypothermia and minor injuries, according to the news agency. Harry Ollerton, from Shropshire, in the UK, was camping in the Ardeche when he was woken at 05:00 on Thursday to ""the loudest thunder and brightest flashes of lighting"". ""It didn't let up - the lightning was constant and terrifyingly close to our tent and campsite,"" he told the BBC. ""It passed straight over us, knocking out the power to our pitch and our phone signal suddenly went dead."" A woman surveys the damaged campsite After realising a nearby drainage ditch was overflowing, Mr Ollerton decided it was no longer safe to stay - but even the drive to the nearest town was difficult. ""Village streets had turned into rivers and the rain was so hard that we couldn't barely see out of the window,"" he said. ""Some of the roads were so flooded that they were barely passable. We were lucky to make it out of the area, soaked through but unharmed, by the sound of things."" Rachel Buchanan, from Oxford in the UK, was also camping in the Ardeche when flooding hit. ""We knew a storm was imminent and couldn't believe the ferocity of last night's storm,"" she told the BBC. ""The level and speed of the river today was extraordinary - we woke up in about a foot of water. ""Driving in our camper van was very frightening as the road by the river was completely under water and waterfalls had appeared from nowhere crashing down the gorge.""

Pat NevinFormer Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 live I'm so excited to see Andriy Yarmolenko in the Premier League. It is the weirdest thing, he is so left footed and a 6'3 player who plays on the right. But when you get him on that left foot he is just about unstoppable. If you haven't watched him before he's absolutely brilliant. West Ham are adding a lot to the squad, it is a totally different team, I thought they would push for seventh before all the deadline day deals, but they will be top half, no doubt about it. Crystal Palace More from Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Iâm very happy with our business. We set out to sign players to replace the ones we lost, and get players of the right type. We all agreed very early there are profiles of players we wanted, we got the keeper we wanted to add and happy with Vicente
Guaita. ""We had to replace the midfielders we lost and add a different type of forward
to the one we had. We pursued these players for a while, it took a while to get
Jordan Ayew over the line, so delighted with the players we brought in. It gives us the same strength as the end of last season, perhaps maybe increased and that best you can hope for."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 Everyone thinking Mina will be a good player clearly only watched the World Cup. Good at attacking set pieces but defensively no better than Keane or Jagielka. By the time he left Palmeiras in Brazil he was often not starting and wasn't popular among the fans.

Pat NevinFormer Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 live I'm so excited to see Andriy Yarmolenko in the Premier League. It is the weirdest thing, he is so left footed and a 6'3 player who plays on the right. But when you get him on that left foot he is just about unstoppable. If you haven't watched him before he's absolutely brilliant. West Ham are adding a lot to the squad, it is a totally different team, I thought they would push for seventh before all the deadline day deals, but they will be top half, no doubt about it. Crystal Palace More from Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Iâm very happy with our business. We set out to sign players to replace the ones we lost, and get players of the right type. We all agreed very early there are profiles of players we wanted, we got the keeper we wanted to add and happy with Vicente
Guaita. ""We had to replace the midfielders we lost and add a different type of forward
to the one we had. We pursued these players for a while, it took a while to get
Jordan Ayew over the line, so delighted with the players we brought in. It gives us the same strength as the end of last season, perhaps maybe increased and that best you can hope for."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 Everyone thinking Mina will be a good player clearly only watched the World Cup. Good at attacking set pieces but defensively no better than Keane or Jagielka. By the time he left Palmeiras in Brazil he was often not starting and wasn't popular among the fans.

"This video can not be played The video game that's actually dementia research Men are better at navigating than women, according to a massive study, but there's not much for men to be proud about. Scientists at University College London say the difference has more to do with discrimination and unequal opportunities than any innate ability. The findings come from research into a test for dementia. But it has also given an unprecedented insight into people's navigational ability all around the world. The experiment is actually a computer game,Sea Hero Quest,external, that has had more than four million players. It's a nautical adventure to save an old sailor's lost memories and with a touch of a smartphone screen, you chart a course round desert islands and icy oceans. The game anonymously records the player's sense of direction and navigational ability. One clear picture, published in the journal Current Biology, was that men were better at navigating than women. But why? Prof Hugo Spiers thinks he has found the answer by looking at data from the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index - which studies equality in areas from education to health and jobs to politics. He told the BBC: ""We don't think the effects we see are innate. ""So countries where there is high equality between men and women, the difference between men and women is very small on our spatial navigation test. ""But when there's high inequality the difference between men and women is much bigger. And that suggests the culture people are living in has an effect on their cognitive abilities."" Women won't have equality for 100 years Sea Hero Quest has produced a raft of other findings. Denmark, Finland and Norway have the world's best navigational skills - possibly down to their ""Viking blood"" Sense of direction is in constant decline after you emerge from your teenage years People in wealthier countries also tend to be the best navigators The deeper the colour, the stronger the country's navigational ability The popularity of the game has turned it into the world's biggest dementia research experiment. Being lost or disoriented is one of the first signs of the disease. The next step in the research is to see if catching sudden declines in navigational ability could be used to test for dementia. Tim Parry, the director of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The data from Sea Hero Quest is providing an unparalleled benchmark for how human navigation varies and changes across age, location and other factors. ""This really is only the beginning of what we might learn about navigation from this powerful analysis."" This project was funded by Deutsche Telekom and the game was designed by Glitchers.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 aims to make it easier to take good snaps Samsung's new high-end smartphone alerts owners to problems with their photos as soon as they are snapped. The Galaxy Note 9 uses software to identify if the images are blurry or whether the subject is blinking, among other issues. The innovation is one of several artificial intelligence-enhanced abilities the handset offers that do not rely on remote computer servers. Analysts say this should help tackle increasing competition from Huawei. The Chinese rival made much of itsown flagship phone's machine learning abilitieswhen it launched in March. The Note 9's other new features include a stylus that wirelessly communicates with the phone to act as a remote control. Its display and battery are also bigger than earlier models. The stylus now works as a remote control It goes on sale on 24 August. The basic model will cost Â£899, while a version with more storage and memory will be Â£1,099. Note 9's S Pen doubles as a selfie stick Why is Samsung's Galaxy S9 struggling? Huawei P20 Pro 'sees in the dark' The New York launch comes just over a week after Samsung revealed that sales of its other high-end smartphone - the Galaxy S9 - had disappointed. It acknowledged at the time that the Note 9's release had beenbrought forward as a consequence,external. ""Samsung will be mindful to criticism that the S9 offered iterative improvements to the S8,"" commented Shaun Collins, chief executive of the CCS Insight consultancy. ""For existing Note users - who are fiercely loyal to the devices - the upgrades will be seen as compelling. ""But the jury is still out on whether people considering an alternative product, such as the iPhone or P20 Pro, will feel this is different enough to bring them across."" Samsung also revealed that a tie-up with games developer Epic meant thatexisting Galaxy phones,externalare the first Android devices to get access to the hit game Fortnite. Note 9 owners are promised access to an exclusive Fortnite outfit They can download a beta version of the game now ahead of it rolling out to other devices later this week. A Galaxy Home smart speaker powered by the firm's virtual assistant Bixby was also unveiled, in addition to a 4G-enabled smartwatch powered by the firm's Tizen operating system. Samsung has shipped nearly 143 million Galaxy Note handsets since the product line launched in 2011, according to market research firm IDC. That represents about 7% of all the smartphones it has delivered over the period, but their premium prices mean they have accounted for 10% of revenues. Source: IDC * Based on preliminary data for April-to-June 2018 Photo review The Note 9 makes use of a rear dual aperture camera - which adjusts how much light gets in - in a similar manner to the S9. But its software is now smarter. The Note 9 was unveiled at an event in New York The Flaw Detection facility warns when: images appear out of focus it detects a smudge on the lens the lighting is bad the subject has their eyes shut In addition, Scene Optimiser algorithms attempt to identify the contents of the scene. If they succeed,  one of 20 sets of adjustments are made to tweak the contrast, colour and other settings. A on-screen alert will warn users if there is a problem with an image None of this requires an internet connection. ""It was really important that Samsung did this on the device because it makes it faster and more secure,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC. ""But I was expecting to see even greater use of AI, and to me this seems like Samsung is catching up with Huawei rather than going beyond."" Samsung did, however, demo new capabilities for its smart assistant Bixby. These included the ability to handle follow-up questions during a conversation, and integration with Google Maps. The new S Pen is the first to include Bluetooth connectivity. This means that in addition to being a stylus, it acts as a remote control. The new S Pen can be recharged by putting it back in the phone It can be used to trigger selfies, play and pause YouTube clips, and move along PowerPoint slides. In addition, Samsung is making it possible for other app developers to make use of the functionality. Mr Jeronimo was more positive about the impact this would have. ""The targeted corporate and professional users will appreciate being able to control presentations remotely,"" he explained. ""Many will now be able to do without a laptop."" Samsung says the S Pen will make it easier to take selfies Although the device looks similar to its predecessor,  the Note 9 is slightly wider and thicker. This allows it to have a slightly bigger 6.4in (16.3cm) display and a 4,000mAh battery - representing 21% more capacity than the Note 8. A more expensive variant is also offered this time round, with 8 gigabytes rather than 6GB of RAM (random-access memory) and 512GB instead of 128GB of internal storage. The firm added that its proprietary CPU (central processing unit) was 33% faster than before. This is likely to appeal to hardcore gamers and other power users if they can justify the cost. Samsung also provided a brief first look at the forthcoming Galaxy Home smart speaker. Samsung has promised to reveal more details about the Galaxy Home at a later event It said the voice-controlled device would direct audio at owners via a technology it called SoundSteer, and added that the device included eight microphones to detect voices - more than Amazon's Echo, Google's Home Max or Apple's HomePod. Samsung said that it had partnered with Spotify to provide a streamed music service but did not reveal if other options would be available. Allow Twitter content?

Two firefighters have been treated for heat-related injuries in the Holy Fire. Officials say that fire is only 5% contained as temperatures continue to stay above 90F (32C). But they are hopeful that weather conditions will improve when temperatures fall over the weekend. Meanwhile, evacuations continued on Wednesday as the Holy Fire flames approached within half a mile of homes. The Mendocino Complex Fire in northern California, which is made up of two separate fires, has burned at least 302,086 acres since it began on 27 July.

"Protesters gathered in Uxbridge, Mr Johnson's constituency, on Thursday Boris Johnson is facing a possible investigation into breaches of the Conservative Party code of conduct. The party has received dozens of complaints about the ex-foreign secretary's comments about Muslim women wearing burkas. The complaints will be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. The party declined to comment on the details of the investigation. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""The code of conduct process is strictly confidential.""  A source close to Mr Johnson offered no comment. Meanwhile more than 30 protesters have gathered in Mr Johnson's constituency of Uxbridge, calling for his resignation. Mr Johnson has rejected calls to apologise for saying people wearing burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"", ina Daily Telegraph column,externalin which he also argued against a ban on full-face veils. Critics have accused him of stoking Islamophobia to boost his Tory leadership ambitions but his supporters have said he was speaking up for ""liberal values"". It comes as a watchdog which advises ex-ministers on taking new jobs ruled that Mr Johnson broke ministerial rules by taking up his weekly column at the Telegraph without consulting it first. Johnson's Telegraph contract broke rules Criticism grows of Johnson's burka jibe Why some Muslim women wear the veil The Conservative Party has been accused of not doing enough to tackle anti-Muslim prejudice in its ranks, despite an initiative to boost tolerance and diversity. Theparty's code of conduct,externalstates that Tory officials and elected representatives must ""lead by example to encourage and foster respect and tolerance"" and not ""use their position to bully, abuse, victimise, harass or unlawfully discriminate against others"". The independent panel will decide whether to refer Mr Johnson to the party's board. Possible action includes suspension of membership or expulsion from the party among other, lesser sanctions. Cressida Dick: Johnson did not commit an offence Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and leader Theresa May have both called on Mr Johnson to apologise for his comments. The founder of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Lord Sheikh, has written to Mr Lewis demanding ""serious action"", while former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became prime minister. A hundred Muslim women who wear the niqab or burka have signed a letter to Mr Lewis, calling on him to withdraw the Conservative whip from Mr Johnson and launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. ""We are not forced to make these clothing choices, nor are we oppressed,"" the women write in their letter, which has been issued to the media by the Muslim Council of Britain. They say Mr Johnson's words will ""inflame tensions in a way that makes it easier for bigots to justify hate crimes against us"". Azmat Parveen, who attended the protest in Uxbridge on Thursday, called Mr Johnson's comments ""painful"". ""This is a way of life, I want to choose this way and somebody remarks on it, I can't bear it, it is very, very rude,"" the 68-year-old said. ""I want him to leave his seat."" Earlier, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said that while many have found Mr Johnson's remarks offensive, officers had decided that he did not commit an offence. She also confirmed that police have not received any criminal complaint against the former foreign secretary. ""I also know that many other people believe strongly that in the whole of the article, what Mr Johnson appears to have been attempting to do was to say that there shouldn't be a ban and that he was engaging in a legitimate debate,"" she added. Asked what she made of the language used by the ex-cabinet minister, Ms Dick told the BBC Asian Network: ""Some people have clearly found it offensive. ""I spoke last night to my very experienced officers who deal with hate crime and, although we have not yet received any allegation of such a crime, I can tell you that my preliminary view having spoken to them is that what Mr Johnson said would not reach the bar for a criminal offence. He did not commit a criminal offence."" She added: ""I am proud to police in a liberal democracy in which people have the right to express their opinions. ""What Mr Johnson said, if it is not criminal, is a matter for Mr Johnson and his friends and colleagues and indeed for the Conservative Party."" The police and Crown Prosecution Service define a hate crime as ""any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, based on a person's disability or perceived disability; race or perceived race; or religion or perceived religion; or sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation or transgender identity or perceived transgender identity"".

"The three clay cones are identified as coming from a temple in southern Iraq Eight 5,000-year-old artefacts looted from Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein will be returned after being identified by the British Museum.

"Apple has taken a tougher stance on gambling apps recently Apple has been accused of accidentally removing apps from the App Store in a crackdown on gambling content. Several developers complained via social media that their apps, which they said had nothing to do with gambling, were taken down. The affected apps included a Polish magazine, a gif-sharing service and a platform for sending clips of Xbox games to friends. The BBC has contacted Apple for comment. A message sent to affected developers said that Apple was removing gambling-related apps made by individuals in an effort to ""reduce fraudulent activity... and comply with government requests to address illegal online gambling activity"". Recently, Norway succeeded in getting Apple to ban all gambling apps from its App Store in the country, although the recent removals appear to have been effected worldwide. Some of the removed apps are now coming back online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Apple says these apps contain gambling but they don't reveal how they have detected this,"" said Simon Stovring, a Copenhagen-based developer behind a gif-sharing app called Gifferent. ""It seems like an unfortunate but honest mistake,"" he told the BBC. Mr Stovring said about 10 fellow-developers had contacted him to say that they too had been hit by the ban. Wojtek Pietrusiewicz, co-owner of the Polish app iMagazine, said it had also been ""caught in the crossfire"". He said he thought the removal might have occurred because the app contains access to the wider internet, which allows users to potentially click through to gambling content. The app, which has thousands of users, was down for a total of 15 hours. While it didn't cause any serious issues, Mr Pietrusiewicz said it did result in ""one angry comment from a reader and a lot of stress for our team"". Another developer, Niall Watchorn, also watched as his app for sharing Xbox game footage was reinstated after several hours. ""It was very frustrating though, as my app has just started gaining traction,"" he told the BBC.

"Northamptonshire County Council approved an action plan for ""radical"" cuts to services A cash-strapped council has approved massive cuts to jobs and services in a bid to tackle a Â£70m funding shortfall. Northamptonshire County Council backed theaction plan to reduce spendingduring a crisis meeting. Children's services, road maintenance and waste management are among the areas facing ""radical"" cuts. Council leader, Conservative Matt Golby, described it as ""the most challenging thing me and my colleagues have ever been faced with"". All but one of the Conservative councillors backed the action plan earlier, while opposition groups voted against. Reality Check: What do councils have to do? The council will now work out what impact this will have on individual services and jobs. The governmentsent in commissioners to oversee Northamptonshirein April after the authority revealed a projected overspend of Â£21m for 2017-18. However, the authority was forced to issue a second spending control order to stave off a projected budget shortfall of Â£60m-Â£70m this financial year. About 20 people gathered outside County Hall to protest against cuts Liberal Democrat councillor Dennis Meredith criticised the fact the Whitehall commissioners are being paid Â£1,500 a day - with the cash-strapped council allegedly picking up the bill. ""I think that's a scandal,"" he said. ""We need to send you back to London. It's only 60 miles."" A small group gathered outside County Hall ahead of the meeting to protest against the cuts, including Alvarez Wilkinson from the Unison union in Northamptonshire. He said: ""We'll be losing a lot of staff and, when you lose a member of staff, you also lose a service. Some messages of protest were chalked outside where the meeting was being held ""I live in the county and as services disappear, I really worry about the welfare of my family."" As it started, a member of the public blasted the Tory councillors who were not present -a total of 15 failed to attend the meeting. Bianca Todd said: ""There are county councillors who are not here today. You have got to be kidding me. We're making national news. ""When people die this winter, because they will die this winter, the blood will be on your hands."" The story behind the cash-crisis council Cash-crisis council: Your thoughts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? Jenny Cotton-Howells from Spectrum, a charity supporting people with learning difficulties, said she was ""worried"" about further cuts to services but ""had faith"" in the council to make ""the right decisions"". She added: ""Any further cuts would be absolutely catastrophic. They cannot cut an already cut service to the bone."" Summarising the debate, Mr Golby vowed to ""not put people at risk"". ""That's not what we're about. We're not going to give up,"" he said. ""We have got to make sure that we provide the services we can. We will meet our statutory duties and I'm happy to say that. ""Do we understand the implications? Yes."" This video can not be played New mother Rachael Ball says she worries over plans to close 21 libraries in Northamptonshire Chief finance officer Mark McLaughlin told the meeting the council ""cannot continue to spend money it doesn't have"" and admitted some previous actions were ""clearly wrong"", but he said the challenge could be ""turned into a success"". Labour group leader Bob Scott said past decisions had been ""catastrophic"" and his group would not vote to harm the people of Northamptonshire, while Lib Dem group leader Chris Stanbra said there were ""unanswered questions"" about ""who knew what and when"" during the crisis. Speaking after the meeting, Northampton South MP Andrew Lewer said it was vital to ""change the relationship between Westminster, Whitehall and local government"" in future. He recognised ""local mismanagement"" was to blame for the council's situation but said it should serve as ""a warning not just for Northamptonshire, but for the rest of the country"". In Tory mythology it is free-spending ""loony left"" Labour councils that get into financial difficulties, not prudent Conservative ones. The reality has never been quite like that. The last time a council went bankrupt, in Hackney, East London, in 2000, it was run by a Labour/Tory coalition. But there is more to the Northamptonshire County Council crisis than embarrassment for Theresa May's government - although that is acute enough, given that the council stuck rigidly to the government's spending guidelines. Local councils have borne the brunt of austerity, with central government funding falling by about half since 2010. If, as some predict, it is not the last council to go under, this will become a national crisis, not a local one, something Labour has been predicting for a long time. September 2017: The council launches an appeal for fairer funding from central government as a Local Government Association (LGA) peer review group says it is ""running out of time"" November 2017: Council staff are told they must take a day's unpaid leave January: Secretary of State for local government Sajid Javid orders a probe into the council's finances 2 February: The council bans almost all new spending for 2017/18 20 February: Auditor KPMG says the council's 2018/19 budget may be unlawful 28 February: The council agrees a revised budget, involving nearly Â£40m in cuts 15 March: Government-appointed inspector Max Caller outlines his findings - recommending Northamptonshire should have two new unitary authorities by 2020 15 March: Council leader Heather Smith resigns following the report's publication 21 March: Chief executiveDamon Lawrenson leaves post 16 April: Matthew Golby elected new leader 16 May: Commissioners drafted in by government begin work 12 July:Theresa Grant named new chief executive 24 July:County council issues second S114 notice 26 July:KPMG says public health funds 'misappropriated' 2 August:Council proposes ""radical service reductions"" 3 August: Former council leader Heather Smith quits Conservative Party 8 August: Northampton South MP Andrew Lewer says ""national drivers"" also causing Northamptonshire's problems, warns other local authorities at risk Northamptonshire County Council, which has an annual budget of Â£441m, is the only authority so far to have formally declared itself at risk of spending more than the money it has available. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) has warnedas many as one in 10 larger local authorities in England with responsibility for social care,externalare draining their reserves and will have exhausted them completely in three years unless something changes. Vulnerable children facing 'catastrophe' Commissioners take over troubled council Cash-strapped council to sell Â£53m HQ It projected that another one in 10 would run out within five years. These reserves are sometimes seen as ""rainy day"" funds. They are there for unplanned expenses or planned one-off costs. They do not get topped back up again unless the council finds the money from somewhere else. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""The financial challenges facing Northamptonshire council are clearly serious and reinforce how important it was that we took swift action to appoint commissioners. ""These commissioners will continue to work closely with the council as it takes the necessary steps to rebalance its finances.""

"Bill Hybels seen as he announced his resignation to shocked churchgoers The leaders at one of the biggest megachurches in the US have quit over a sexual misconduct scandal that has already claimed its founder. A statement from elders at the Willow Creek church said a ""new start"" was needed, and that they should have handled the allegations better. Bill Hybels stepped down earlier this year after accusations of inappropriate conduct emerged. He has denied the allegations but said he had become a distraction. With more than 25,000 members and locations in Chicago, Willow Creek is thought to bethe fifth largest megachurch in the US,external. Megachurches are defined as congregations with regular weekly attendance of at least 2,000 persons. Several women have come forward with accusations against Mr Hybels dating back to the 1990s. Earlier this year, the Chicago Tribune and Christianity Today bothdetailed allegations that he had made unwanted advances and suggestive comments,externalto church members. Church leaders were reportedly told four years ago that Mr Hybels was having an affair with one woman and was accused of harassment by others. An internal investigation cleared him of wrongdoing. What has #MeToo actually changed? But in April, after the allegations went public, Mr Hybels said he would step down, months ahead of his planned retirement date in October this year. His announcement brought gasps from his congregation. New allegations emerged over the weekend,with a former assistant alleging he groped her repeatedly,external. The latest claims prompted the resignation of one of Mr Hybels' successors Steve Carter, who quit over the church's handling of the misconduct allegations. It appears the rest of the church leaders also felt compelled to act. In their statement, church elders said investigations had been ""flawed"",externaland that their trust in Willow Creek's founder had ""clouded our judgement"". ""We, as a board, know Willow needs and deserves a fresh start, and the entire board will step down to create room for a new board,"" it said. The church's lead pastor, Heather Larson. who also stepped down, said trust had been broken and there was an urgency to ""move in a better direction"". The announcement comes as it is due to host a summit of hundreds of churches, but scores have dropped out. Willow Creek has appointed Steve Gillen as a new lead pastor and has promised an independent review of its governance. Leaving the church after learning the news, churchgoerLisa Dudley told the New York Times: ""I never had a personal relationship with any of those pastors,external, but I have a personal relationship with God.""

"Caroline Montague in her 20s and her son Thomas Tozer, 25 They are often said to be the best years of your life, but how different is it to be in your 20s now, than 10 or 20 years ago? Thomas Tozer is 25 and lives in London. His twin brother also lives in the city. They meet up every week but he would not consider him one of his closest friends. And Thomas is not alone. A new index which looks at people's wellbeing,externalhas found that 20 to 29-year-olds today are feeling more distant from their family and close friends than 20-somethings were in the previous two decades. They are also less likely to feel a sense of belonging in their community and wider society. Originally from Devon, Thomas says his closest friends now are ones he's met in the last five years. He lives with one of them and another he's in touch with every day via Whatsapp. ""Unless social media is backed up by seeing each other, it kind of peters out and starts to feel a bit hollow,"" the York graduate said. Young adults in 2015 were 80% less likely to say one of their three closest friends was a relative than those in 1995. This was used by the index to measure the quality of family relationships. ""If I had a problem, or was upset, I wouldn't go to my parents, I'd speak to my friends,"" Thomas said. Thomas's mother, Caroline Montague, has a different experience. ""My father was definitely my best friend. He was always there,"" the 64-year-old said, thinking back to her 20s. Caroline spent her 20s living in Bristol, before moving to Bath. At 20, she had got a job as a trainee travel clerk and lived above the travel agents - about two miles from her father's house. ""My life was basically work,"" she said. ""I had a mortgage but worked seven days a week to pay for it - with a bar job at the weekend. I had a lot of responsibility from the word go. I got myself from the bottom to management."" 'Generation Sensible' in five charts Are young people going cool on cars? Place and family were crucial to her sense of belonging at that time. ""I loved where I lived and definitely felt I belonged. For me, I never properly left home until I was in my 30s,"" she said. For Thomas, belonging comes from his practice of Buddhism. ""It's an important part of my life and identity. It defines a lot of who I am,"" he said. ""Without that I wouldn't feel explicitly connected to London or home (Devon)."" So-called ""belonging wellbeing"" declined by 32% between 2005 and 2015. The index puts this down to falls in volunteering, being part of a religion and an interest in politics, which the foundation says are activities associated with a sense of belonging. The Intergenerational Foundation - an independent think tank focused on fairness between generations - has used data from largepanel surveys,externalto create an Index of Wellbeing. Five different wellbeing areas were taken into account -relationships,economics,health,personal environmentandbelonging- at three different snap-shots in time:1995,2005and2015for people aged 20 to 29 at each of these points. More than 1,500 people in each wave were then scored on their wellbeing. The index also found close friendships declined between the 2005 and 2015 cohorts of 20-somethings - falling 6% in 10 years, despite rises in social media in the same period. This was measured by asking how often people are in touch with their three closest friends. Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said the cracks appearing in this generation's closest relationships and sense of belonging should be of concern to everyone. But the index doesn't tell everyone's story. The Hayman family now and Anne Hayman in her 20s at home in Newport Will Hayman would count his older brother among his closest friends. ""That's something that's changed as we've got older,"" the 27-year-old from Newport, south Wales, said. The pair speak almost every day and he's in touch with his other friends most days through text or Whatsapp. These friendships are ""really important to everyday life"", the secondary school teacher said. ""Most of them are old friends from childhood. I would consider them almost family friends. That feeling that you go back so long with the same interests and backgrounds."" Will has recently moved from nearby Cardiff back in with his parents in Newport to save money. ""Moving back home means I can do more than just pay rent. I was lucky they were just down the road,"" he said. Bucking the trend for his age group, Will said he does feel like he belongs. He doesn't participate in a religion or volunteer, but he knows and socialises with lots of likeminded people in his community and plays tennis in a local club. Beyond Newport, he said he feels part of UK society: ""I'm engaged with politics, I have lots of friends in London and spent five years living in Liverpool."" ""My 20s so far have been about putting my interests, hobbies and socialising first and finding out about who you really are,"" he said. Will Hayman, 27, and his mother Anne - seen here in her 20s By contrast, Will's mother, Anne Hayman, had had her first child, bought a house and was preparing to get married by his age. Having left school at 16, Anne lived in her family home in Newport until she was 26 and worked in the town centre's reference library. ""I had a big circle of friends - we'd be out all the time at gigs, pubs or the cinema,"" Anne, now 57, said. ""I was always skint but I had enough to go out and go on holidays."" The security of family and close friends instilled a sense of belonging, with Anne adding that her sister was definitely counted as one of her closest friends. ""I was always politically aware and part of the Young Socialists in my 20s. When I joined the trade union, I would go to Labour party meetings - that was a community to which I belonged,"" she said. ""I think we had a fantastic 20s."" Elsewhere, the index found a decline in health wellbeing of 11% between the 1995 and 2015 cohorts, which points to a deterioration in how 20-somethings assess their own physical health. Report author David  Kingman said this ""could be due to an increase in obesity or it could be due to greater exposure to social media and anxiety over body image since younger generations are drinking less, taking drugs less, and exercising more than previous generations did at the same age"".

"The heatwave is being blamed for record numbers of people going to A&E in England in July. As temperatures soared, attendances reached more than 2.1 million - the highest since records began in 2010. The number of patients waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery also rose to their highest point in more than six years, at 3,517. This is despite a pledge in 2014 by the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to end the ""unacceptable"" waits. The figures are part of a raft of data released on Thursday by NHS England. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Health bodies said the heatwave had added to existing pressures on the NHS, with reports of more people turning up with dehydration, heart failure and kidney problems related to the unusually high temperatures. Prof John Appleby, chief economist of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""July 2018 was the most pressured summer month for A&E departments in recent history, showing that there's no doubt this summer's heatwave has caused severe strain on the NHS."" A&E attendances reached 2,176,022 in July - up from 2,091,318 in June - although attendances have steadily climbed since 2010. The NHS England data also shows,externalthere were 530,000 emergency admissions to A&E, a figure only surpassed once - in May this year - since 2010. The number of patients waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks for routine surgery in June was also at the highest level in a decade, at more than 500,000. The NHS is meant to see 90% of patients who need such operations within 18 weeks, but only 87.8% of patients were seen in that time. The Society for Acute Medicine said the summer was usually a time for frontline staff to ""recharge the batteries"" but that had not happened this year. Dr Nick Scriven, the society's president, said: ""Last year NHS leaders admitted it took until October to recover from winter 2017 and we are now only a few months away from the next onslaught... ""On the plus side, this may have triggered alarm bells earlier than normal and lead to some positive actions being put in place to help us contend with the inevitable winter pressures we will face."" The Royal College of Nursing said the heatwave had placed winter-like strains on the health service. Donna Kinnair, director of nursing policy and practice at the RCN, said nurses were seeing more cases of heart failure, renal failure and dehydration, with older people being particularly at risk. An NHS England spokesman added that there had been an ""unprecedented summer surge"" in July. ""Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in 10 people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours,"" the spokesman said. Separately,a survey,externalof 760,000 people across England on their views of their GP practices showed nearly 40% of patients were unable to get an appointment at the time they wanted. It also found that just 66% of patients who wanted a same-day appointment said they managed to get one. However, nearly 84% described their overall experience of their surgery as very or fairly good. And 68.6% rated their overall experience of making an appointment as good. About a third (35.6%) of patients who wanted to see a GP but found their practice was closed said they ended up going to A&E. The survey of patients in England has been redesigned and now includes 16 to 17-year-olds for the first time, so results cannot be compared to previous years, NHS England said. NHS England also released data on waiting times for young people being treated for eating disorders. In 2016 it introduced waiting time targets to ensure fast treatment for under-19s with eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. NHS England's figures showed that the proportion of routine cases being seen within the four-week target has risen from 79.9% to 81.2% on the previous quarter. That means 1,243 children and young people out of a total of 1,530 were seen within the target. But the number of urgent cases seen within the target of one week fell from 78.9% to 74.7% - equivalent to 219 young people out of a total of 293. Andrew Radford, chief executive of Beat, the eating disorder charity, said there was still a postcode lottery on how long children and young people were waiting for treatment. An NHS England spokesman said there had been a significant improvement in treatment times for NHS care. ""An extra Â£30m is going into children's eating disorder services every year, with 70 new and improved treatment centres set up in 2017, covering the whole of the country to ensure more young people get the right care, at the time, closer to home,"" he said. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The history of the NHS in charts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Boris Johnson broke ministerial rules when he took on his Daily Telegraph column after quitting as foreign secretary, a watchdog says. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) said Mr Johnson did not observe a minimum three-month waiting period for taking up new jobs. The watchdog said it was ""unacceptable"" Mr Johnson had not sought its advice before signing the contract. Labour accused Mr Johnson of showing ""utter contempt"" for democracy. Mr Johnson's office has not responded to a request for a comment. The committee advises ex-ministers on taking new jobs after they quit. Johnson to be investigated over burka row It does this based on rules aimed at avoiding the risk of a former minister ""improperly exploiting privileged access to contacts in government"" and the suspicion that a new job is ""a reward for past favours"". In aletter to Mr Johnson,external, the committee quoted the ministerial code which says ministers must seek its advice about ""any appointments or employment"" they want to take on within two years after leaving office. ""The committee considers it to be unacceptable that you signed a contract with The Telegraph and your appointment was announced before you had sought and obtained advice from the committee, as was incumbent on you leaving office under the government's business appointment rules,"" it said. It says Mr Johnson has agreed not to use ""privileged information"" in the role and says his contract should be amended to reflect this. Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon Trickett said: ""Boris Johnson's flagrant breach of the rules shows the utter contempt he has for democracy and ridding politics of vested interests, and raises serious questions about why he was so desperate to start writing for the Telegraph again. ""The system is clearly not working when the former foreign secretary can simply ignore the official body that oversees appointments seemingly without any consequences. ""A drastic overhaul of this toothless body is urgently needed so we can put an end to politicians and the establishment working only for the interests of themselves."" His comments echoa report by a cross-party committee of MPs,external, in April, which described Acoba as ""a toothless regulator which has failed to change the environment around business appointments"". The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs committee called for urgent reform of the watchdog to improve public trust. Mr Johnson resigned from the government over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy on 9 July, signed the contract on 12 July and referred himself to the committee on 26 July, the letter says. The former London mayor has previously worked as a journalist, and earned almost Â£23,000 a month writing for the Daily Telegraph before being appointed as foreign secretary last year.

"Boris Johnson said he did not want to see full-face coverings banned, but said it was ""ridiculous"" women chose to wear them Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is facing growing criticism over his remark that Muslim women wearing the burka ""look like letter boxes"". Dominic Grieve, the ex-attorney general, said he would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader. Ex-Tory chairwoman Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks could trigger a rise in hate crime. Senior Tories have urged him to apologise but he has not done so, and has stood by his comments. Johnson burka 'letter box' jibe sparks anger Why do Muslim women wear the veil? The Islamic veil across Europe Ina Daily Telegraph article,external, he said full-face veils should not be banned, but it was ""absolutely ridiculous"" women chose to ""go around looking like letter boxes"". He also compared them to looking like ""bank robbers"". A source close to the former London mayor has said: ""We must not fall into the trap of shutting down the debate on difficult issues. ""We have to call it out. If we fail to speak up for liberal values then we are simply yielding ground to reactionaries and extremists."" But, speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Grieve - a former Remain campaigner who has previously clashed with Mr Johnson over Brexit - said his behaviour was ""very embarrassing"". Mr Grieve said he would ""without the slightest doubt"", quit the Tories if Mr Johnson became leader, ""because I don't regard him as a fit and proper person to lead a political party"". This video can not be played ""There's no reason to insult people in that way,"" one woman told the BBC's Asian Network The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has also backed calls for an apology over what she called ""gratuitously offensive"" comments. Speaking at an event in North Berwick, East Lothian, she said: ""This wasn't an off-the-cuff slip, he wrote a column, he knew exactly what he was doing and I think it crossed from being provocative and starting a debate and actually it became rude and gratuitous. ""It's also not been shown through history that when men make sweeping statements about what women should or shouldn't wear that it goes well for them. ""I think he should apologise for them."" This video can not be played ""He now does things which are embarrassing to the image of the party"" - Dominic Grieve tells World at One about Boris Johnson Earlier Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said there was no reason not to have a ""robust conversation"" about the subject, but added: ""We're not talking to our friends in the pub. We are public figures and we have an additional obligation to be careful."" A former Tory chairman, Lord Pickles, said Mr Johnson, who was foreign secretary until resigning last month over Brexit, risked ""closing down"" the debate with his ""illiberal language"". Supporters of Mr Johnson say the row is politically-motivated and that other senior Tories have made similar remarks without such criticism. By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent By saying what he did, in the way he said it, Boris Johnson was guaranteed to provoke a reaction. The question of what Muslim women choose to wear in public is a sensitive one, around which most politicians tread very carefully. But Boris Johnson is not most politicians. And by using language you rarely hear in the normal course of political debate, the former foreign secretary has attracted attention and criticism. If it was his intention to remind everyone that Boris is still Boris, not afraid to say what he thinks, despite being out of government and away on holiday, it was not without risk. Figures show a rise in Islamophobic attacks and the Conservative party faces criticism for not addressing anti-Muslim prejudice in its own ranks. In this context, many feel he has picked the wrong time to tackle the wrong issue. But as ever, being outspoken is at once appealing to Boris Johnson's supporters and distasteful to his detractors. Mr Johnson, who is the current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, has long been seen as a potential candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He fronted the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, and resigned as foreign secretary last month in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plans. Writing in the Guardian,external, Baroness Warsi said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""indefensible"" and ""have no place in the modern Conservative Party"". She said, although he was setting out a liberal position on the burka, he was doing it in an ""alt-right"" way, and using Muslim women as ""political fodderâ¦ to stake out a leadership bid"". ""Johnson's wordsâ¦ send out a message that Muslim women are fair game,"" she wrote. Baroness Warsi was the first Muslim woman to sit in a British cabinet But mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, said it was ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments showed a ""lack of knowledge"". Shetold BBC Radio 5 Live: ""In today's day and age, the majority of the women who wear the burka are born and brought up in this country, are educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters and none of them wears a burka, adding: ""It's not a must, it's not an obligation."" Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, who wears the niqab, told BBC News: ""I absolutely have no problem with anyone disagreeing with my choice to wear it and criticising it. ""But when you demonise and dehumanise a minority, who happen to be women of colour, I have a problem with this. ""It's not for the state, it's not for the government and it's definitely not for middle-aged white men to tell me what to wear and what not to."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'has caused offence', PM says Tory MP for Mansfield, Ben Bradley, said it was not the language he would have used, but added: ""Ultimately he is a journalist... and journalists want their pieces to be read. ""They want people to talk about what they have written [and] I would say that is probably the motivation."" Mr Johnson's former adviser Munira Mirza said Mr Johnson's views on the burka had been ""entirely consistent"" and other Conservative politicians had expressed the same view, without being called Islamophobic. In 2013 former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke - who also opposed a ban on the public wearing of burkas - said they should not be worn while giving evidence in court. He referred to burkas as a ""peculiar costume"" and a ""kind of bag"". Ms Mirza added: ""The reality is there is a political fight here. People who frankly couldn't care less about the issues that Muslim women face are piling into Boris because Boris said it."" Conservative MP Conor Burns also defended Mr Johnson, accusing his political colleagues of ""bandwagon jumping"". The member for Bournemouth West tweeted those who criticised the former foreign secretary ""clearly didn't understand"" his comments. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Last year,Zaynab Hussein, a mother from Leicester, was left fighting for her lifeafter a man she didn't know smashed into her with his car - and then ran over her again. She was attacked because she was a Muslim. Tell Mama, the national organisation that collects anti-Muslim attack statistics, says that the majority of street victims of such abuse and violence are women, for the same reason that Mrs Hussein was singled out: some Muslim women are easily identifiable by their mode of dress - and therefore easy to target. Seven years ago Baroness Warsi said prejudice against Muslims had passed the ""dinner table test"". And Mr Johnson's critics regard his ""letter box"" and ""bank robber"" comments as part of the problem the peer defined: normalising prejudice and dehumanising women, rather than calmly debating the complexities of the veil in an open society. Since Baroness Warsi's warning, there has been the launch of a cross-departmental working group to tackle anti-Muslim hate. But it has been criticised as toothless, not least because the government can't agree a definition for Islamophobia. In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson - who last month quit the government in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy - was commenting on the introduction of a burka ban in Denmark. He said he felt ""fully entitled"" to expect women to remove face coverings when talking to him at his MP surgery - and schools and universities should be able to take the same approach if a student ""turns up... looking like a bank robber"". ""If you tell me that the burka is oppressive, then I am with you,"" he said. ""If you say that it is weird and bullying to expect women to cover their faces, then I totally agree - and I would add that I can find no scriptural authority for the practice in the Koran. ""I would go further and say that it is absolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letter boxes."" He said businesses and government agencies should be able to ""enforce a dress code"" that allowed them to see customers' faces. But he said: ""Such restrictions are not quite the same as telling a free-born adult woman what she may or may not wear, in a public place, when she is simply minding her own business."" He said a total ban on face-covering veils would give a boost to radicals who said there was a ""clash of civilisations"" between Islam and the West, and could lead to ""a general crackdown on any public symbols of religious affiliation"".

"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised for saying Muslim women wearing burkas ""look like letter boxes"" and for comparing them to ""bank robbers"" - prompting calls for him to apologise andbe expelled from the Conservative Party. But Mr Johnson's comments, which some believe will aggravate Islamophobic tensions in the UK, have also highlighted some confusion about what a burka is - as the veil revealing just the eyes is, in fact, known as a niqab. So what actually are the differences between the various types of Islamic dress for women and what governs their choices? The Koran, Islam's holy book, tells Muslims - men and women - to dress modestly. Male modesty has been interpreted to be covering the area from the navel to the knee. For women it is generally seen as covering everything except their face, hands and feet when in the presence of men they are not related or married to. However, there has been much debate within Islam as to whether this goes far enough. This has led to a distinction between the hijab (literally ""covering up"" in Arabic) and the niqab (meaning ""full veil""). Thehijabis typically a scarf that covers the hair and neck, whereas theniqabis a veil for the face that leaves the area around the eyes clear. It is worn with an accompanying headscarf or anabaya, a full-length robe, and sometimes with a separate transparent eye veil. Theburkais the most concealing - covering the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through. This video can not be played Four Muslim women discuss their relationship with the veil UK mother-of-seven Tahira Noor, who has been wearing a burka for 20 years, says it's ""100% my choice"" and Mr Johnson's comments show a ""lack of knowledge"". The ""majority of the women who wear the burka"" she says, are born and brought up in Britain. They are ""educated in this country, they've been to colleges, universities, and have understood why they want to do what they're doing,""she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're under no oppression, they're not doing it because their husbands want them to or their fathers want them to."" Ms Noor has four daughters none of whom wear a burka. ""I haven't forced my daughters into it because I don't have to,"" she said. ""It's not a must. It's not an obligation. However... [it] gets you closer to God. It's a spiritual thing more than anything else."" She is ""not under an obligation"" to cover her face but does so because it is ""emulating"" the Prophet Muhammad. So, how does she respond if asked to remove her covering for security reasons? ""I'm happy to take my veil off,"" she said, citing the example of being asked to at a bank. ""When I travel, and I do travel, sometimes I don't even wear [it] because I think it's a lot easier not to [for] security reasons. ""To make comments that they (women who wear burkas) look like bank robbers, I don't think it's fair."" Sahar Al-Faifi said she has experienced verbal abuse for wearing a niqab Sahar Al-Faifi, from Cardiff, wears the niqab but told BBC News she sometimes gets verbal abuse from others for her choice of veil. ""A week ago someone abused me and said 'you're an ugly terrorist' when I tried to park my car near where I live,"" she said. ""Two years ago, when I was passing by one department to another at Heath Hospital, someone passed by and said 'don't cut off my head you're ISIS'. It's quite painful [to hear]."" In 2014, BBC News' Shaimaa Khalil wrote about why shestopped wearing her headscarf, only to put it back on againwhen she became the Pakistan correspondent. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a British-American Muslim doctor who lives in New York, does not wear a face veil and supports a ban on them. She said the number of women wearing them in the West is increasing in part because girls begin to wear them before they reach puberty and many were not given a choice. The burka completely covers a woman's body Muslim scholars have long debated whether it is obligatory to wear the burka or niqab, or whether it is just recommended. There have also been more liberal interpretations which say any headscarf is unnecessary, as long as women maintain the sartorial modesty stipulated in the Koran. That holy text addresses ""the faithful women"" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment ""except what is apparent of it"". Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means. Does it refer to the outer surface of a woman's garments, necessitating that she cover every part of her body - ie don the full niqab? Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets and make-up? The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favour the hijab - headscarf - option. There are additional Koranic instructions - seen as ambiguous and therefore much debated - for women to draw the ""khimar"" (scarf) to cover the ""jayb"" (bosom/upper chest), and for ""the wives and daughters of the Prophet and the women of the believers to draw their ""jalabib"" (cloaks) close round them"". Two women wearing niqabs leave a polling station in Luton When contacted by BBC Reality Check, both the Women's Muslim Council and Faith Matters (an organisation which promotes integration) said accurate numbers weren't available for the UK. But there does seem to be consensus that the figure is likely to be low. Dr Omar Khan, director at the Runnymede Trust, a think tank that deals with race equality, said that it is likely to be ""less than 1% [of the Muslim female population] - how much less is difficult to know"". Sunder Katwala, director of think tank British Future,acknowledged a lack of a ""robust methodology"",external, but said there was a ""ballpark estimate in region of 3,000-5,000"" with it ""very unlikely to be as high as 1-2%"" of the female Muslim population. These are both estimates by experts working in relevant fields, but until specific research is carried out, it will be difficult to know how prevalent the full-face veil is. What we do know is that in the 2011 census, Muslims represented 4.8% of the population of England and Wales. Using the most recent population estimates, this would mean there are roughly 1.43 million Muslim women living in the two nations. If the number of Muslim women wearing the niqab were to be as high as 1% - this would equate to just over 14,000 women - but, again, the 1% figure is just an estimate. In other European countries, the figure also appears to be low. Denmark woman fined for wearing veil In 2009, a French Interior Ministry report estimated that just 0.1% of French Muslim women wore full-face veils which, at the time, equated to 1,900 women. In Austria, a ban of full face veils in public spaces was said to affect just 0.03% of the Muslim population, according to Nilufar Ahmed, asenior lecturer in public health,externalat Swansea University. In Belgium between 150 and 200 women wore the niqab before a ban came into force, says Michael Privot, director of the European Network Against Racism. Between 150 and 200 women in Demark - which banned face veils in public this month - wore a niqab or burqa on a daily basis. That's 0.1% ofMuslim women,externalin the country, according to the Guardian. Women in Denmark protested against the country's new law that says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"" WhileBoris Johnson's comments,externalabout Islamic face veils have provoked consternation among some, his defenders have said they were made as part of an argument against banning such garments. Other countries though, have taken this step. Francewas the first European country to ban full-face veils - ie burkas and niqabs - in public places in April 2011, seven years after it introduced a law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in state schools. It was followed a few months later byBelgium, which banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public on the grounds of security. Full or partial bans on full-face veils have since been in place inAustria,Bulgaria, the southern German state ofBavariaand, since 1 August,Denmark. There have been protests against Denmark's new law, which does not mention burkas and niqabs by name, but says ""anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine"". Repeat offenders could be fined 10,000 ($1,500; Â£1,200) kroner. The Islamic veil across Europe Iran jails woman for removing headscarf Iranian women threw off the hijab - then what? By contrast, inIranthe law requires women to wear modest ""Islamic"" clothing. In practice, this means women must wear a chador, a full-body cloak, or a headscarf and a manteau (overcoat) that covers their arms. There are posters in cities and towns comparing unveiled women to unwrapped candy and lollipops attracting unwanted attention from flies. Recently, some Iranian women have protested against this law by taking off their headscarf in public. One woman was jailed for two years in March for doing this.

"The heatwave is being blamed for record numbers of people going to A&E in England in July. As temperatures soared, attendances reached more than 2.1 million - the highest since records began in 2010. The number of patients waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery also rose to their highest point in more than six years, at 3,517. This is despite a pledge in 2014 by the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to end the ""unacceptable"" waits. The figures are part of a raft of data released on Thursday by NHS England. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Health bodies said the heatwave had added to existing pressures on the NHS, with reports of more people turning up with dehydration, heart failure and kidney problems related to the unusually high temperatures. Prof John Appleby, chief economist of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""July 2018 was the most pressured summer month for A&E departments in recent history, showing that there's no doubt this summer's heatwave has caused severe strain on the NHS."" A&E attendances reached 2,176,022 in July - up from 2,091,318 in June - although attendances have steadily climbed since 2010. The NHS England data also shows,externalthere were 530,000 emergency admissions to A&E, a figure only surpassed once - in May this year - since 2010. The number of patients waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks for routine surgery in June was also at the highest level in a decade, at more than 500,000. The NHS is meant to see 90% of patients who need such operations within 18 weeks, but only 87.8% of patients were seen in that time. The Society for Acute Medicine said the summer was usually a time for frontline staff to ""recharge the batteries"" but that had not happened this year. Dr Nick Scriven, the society's president, said: ""Last year NHS leaders admitted it took until October to recover from winter 2017 and we are now only a few months away from the next onslaught... ""On the plus side, this may have triggered alarm bells earlier than normal and lead to some positive actions being put in place to help us contend with the inevitable winter pressures we will face."" The Royal College of Nursing said the heatwave had placed winter-like strains on the health service. Donna Kinnair, director of nursing policy and practice at the RCN, said nurses were seeing more cases of heart failure, renal failure and dehydration, with older people being particularly at risk. An NHS England spokesman added that there had been an ""unprecedented summer surge"" in July. ""Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in 10 people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours,"" the spokesman said. Separately,a survey,externalof 760,000 people across England on their views of their GP practices showed nearly 40% of patients were unable to get an appointment at the time they wanted. It also found that just 66% of patients who wanted a same-day appointment said they managed to get one. However, nearly 84% described their overall experience of their surgery as very or fairly good. And 68.6% rated their overall experience of making an appointment as good. About a third (35.6%) of patients who wanted to see a GP but found their practice was closed said they ended up going to A&E. The survey of patients in England has been redesigned and now includes 16 to 17-year-olds for the first time, so results cannot be compared to previous years, NHS England said. NHS England also released data on waiting times for young people being treated for eating disorders. In 2016 it introduced waiting time targets to ensure fast treatment for under-19s with eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. NHS England's figures showed that the proportion of routine cases being seen within the four-week target has risen from 79.9% to 81.2% on the previous quarter. That means 1,243 children and young people out of a total of 1,530 were seen within the target. But the number of urgent cases seen within the target of one week fell from 78.9% to 74.7% - equivalent to 219 young people out of a total of 293. Andrew Radford, chief executive of Beat, the eating disorder charity, said there was still a postcode lottery on how long children and young people were waiting for treatment. An NHS England spokesman said there had been a significant improvement in treatment times for NHS care. ""An extra Â£30m is going into children's eating disorder services every year, with 70 new and improved treatment centres set up in 2017, covering the whole of the country to ensure more young people get the right care, at the time, closer to home,"" he said. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The history of the NHS in charts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Pat NevinFormer Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 live I'm so excited to see Andriy Yarmolenko in the Premier League. It is the weirdest thing, he is so left footed and a 6'3 player who plays on the right. But when you get him on that left foot he is just about unstoppable. If you haven't watched him before he's absolutely brilliant. West Ham are adding a lot to the squad, it is a totally different team, I thought they would push for seventh before all the deadline day deals, but they will be top half, no doubt about it. Crystal Palace More from Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Iâm very happy with our business. We set out to sign players to replace the ones we lost, and get players of the right type. We all agreed very early there are profiles of players we wanted, we got the keeper we wanted to add and happy with Vicente
Guaita. ""We had to replace the midfielders we lost and add a different type of forward
to the one we had. We pursued these players for a while, it took a while to get
Jordan Ayew over the line, so delighted with the players we brought in. It gives us the same strength as the end of last season, perhaps maybe increased and that best you can hope for."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 Everyone thinking Mina will be a good player clearly only watched the World Cup. Good at attacking set pieces but defensively no better than Keane or Jagielka. By the time he left Palmeiras in Brazil he was often not starting and wasn't popular among the fans.

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties At least 29 children have been killed and 30 wounded in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in Yemen, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The children were travelling on a bus that was hit at a market in Dahyan, in the northern province of Saada. The health ministry run by the rebel Houthi movement put the death toll at 43, and said 61 people were wounded. The coalition, which is backing Yemen's government in a war with the Houthis, said its actions were ""legitimate"". It insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. Meanwhile the new UN special envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, is planning to invite the warring parties to Geneva in September to discuss a framework for negotiations. This video can not be played UN envoy Martin Griffiths says that if peace efforts in Yemen fail, the world could be looking at âSyria-plus"". He told the BBC's Lyse Doucet that if the conflict is left unresolved, Yemen could collapse and the international community could be looking at ""Syria-plus"" in the years to come. ""The war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even more than it is now."" Yemeni tribal elders told the Associated Press that the bus was hit as it passed through Dahyan market,externaland that it was transporting local civilians, including many school children. The charity Save the Children said it had been told by its staff that the children were on their way back to school from a picnic,externalwhen the driver of their bus stopped to get a drink. The vehicle was stationary when the attack happened, it added. The ICRC said it was sending extra supplies to help hospitals deal with the influx The ICRC said a hospital it supported in Saada had received the bodies of 29 children,external, all of them under the age of 15, and 48 injured people, among them 30 children. It sent additional supplies to the hospital to cope with the influx of patients. Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that 47 people were killed and 77 wounded, and broadcast graphic pictures showing the bodies of several young children, some of them wearing school uniform. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam accused the coalition of showing ""clear disregard for civilian life"" by targeting a crowded public place. Allow Twitter content?

The ICRC stressed that ""under international humanitarian law, civilians must be protected during conflict"", whilethe secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland called it a ""grotesque, shameful"" attack,externalthat showed ""blatant disregard for rules of war"". Save the Children described the incident as ""horrific"", and called for a full, immediate and independent investigation into recent attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. It was not immediately clear whether the bus was the target of the air strike, butcoalition spokesman Col Turki al-Malki said the attack was ""a legitimate military action,external, conducted in conformity with international humanitarian law"". Air strikes were reported in the rebel-held capital of Sanaa later on Thursday He said it had hit ""militants responsible for planning and targeting civilians"" in the southern Saudi city of Jizan on Wednesday night, where one Yemeni resident was killed and 11 others were injured by fragments from an intercepted ballistic missile that was launched by the Houthis from neighbouring Amran province. He accused the rebels of using children as ""tools and covers for their terrorist acts"". Later, air strikes were reported in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa. A week ago, at least 55 civilians were killed and 170 others wounded in a series of attacks on the rebel-held Red Sea port city of Hudaydah. The coalition denied that it had carried out air strikes in the area, and blamed the deaths on rebel mortar fire. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

This video can not be played Eddie Mair plays Bring Me Sunshine to end his final BBC Radio show The presenter announced in Julyhe was leaving the BBC after more than 30 years. He has been signed by commercial station LBC. PM presenter Eddie Mair 'offered to take pay cut' The 52-year-old had been a presenter on Radio 4's PM programme since 1998. Paddy O'Connell is guest presenting PM for Thursday and Carolyn Quinn on Friday. Mair's full-time replacement has still to be announced. There will be a number of stand in presenters over the next few weeks including Chris Mason, Sarah Smith and Jonny Dymond with Carolyn Quinn. Mair will join LBC in September.

Hello I'm sorry I'm not in the office today as planned. I seem to have picked up one of those 48 hour bugs. Atishoo. Thank you Paddy for stepping in. Coincidentally, I want to tell you about what happened just after PM finished last night. As you may know, we finished the show with a full rendition by Willie Nelson of 'Bring Me Sunshine'. It was, in keeping with the tradition of PM, a suggestion by a listener. Making the show yesterday had been tortuous for everyone on a quiet news day but in the end, I think we made something pretty good. Eloise and I looked at each other after the meeting and agreed that there was no way to match that for a last Eddie programme. So, that's what it wasâ¦my last PM. It felt right then and it feels right now. No fuss or faff, just as I wanted. Genuinely unplanned, and with its origins in a listener idea. Perfect. Or as close to perfect as we're likely to get. I hate saying goodboo. Sorryâ¦goodbee. Noâ¦goodbiy. Dammit. I still can't say it. What I do say is this. One of the biggest struggles I had in deciding whether to leave is a truth we both understand. Yes I bring something to PM and I have talents and abilities that help the programme. But I also understand completely that the work of all the people on PM make me sound much much better than my own abilities can muster. This is just a truth. And what I wrestled with was, in essence, 'can I manage without them?' I don't know the answer to that but it's high time I tried. Working with you all has been the joy of my professional life. There is a rich deep seam of talent in our department and I've been privileged to be part of it. Thank you for everything you've done for PM, iPM and hundreds of years ago in my case, BH. I am literally missing you already. From what I know of the plans for the department, PM is about to get a brilliant editor. The show, about which I care so much, is about to get even better. So this old fart is buggering off and leaving you to do what you all do brilliantly. Thank you.

"Boris Johnson broke ministerial rules when he took on his Daily Telegraph column after quitting as foreign secretary, a watchdog says. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) said Mr Johnson did not observe a minimum three-month waiting period for taking up new jobs. The watchdog said it was ""unacceptable"" Mr Johnson had not sought its advice before signing the contract. Labour accused Mr Johnson of showing ""utter contempt"" for democracy. Mr Johnson's office has not responded to a request for a comment. The committee advises ex-ministers on taking new jobs after they quit. Johnson to be investigated over burka row It does this based on rules aimed at avoiding the risk of a former minister ""improperly exploiting privileged access to contacts in government"" and the suspicion that a new job is ""a reward for past favours"". In aletter to Mr Johnson,external, the committee quoted the ministerial code which says ministers must seek its advice about ""any appointments or employment"" they want to take on within two years after leaving office. ""The committee considers it to be unacceptable that you signed a contract with The Telegraph and your appointment was announced before you had sought and obtained advice from the committee, as was incumbent on you leaving office under the government's business appointment rules,"" it said. It says Mr Johnson has agreed not to use ""privileged information"" in the role and says his contract should be amended to reflect this. Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon Trickett said: ""Boris Johnson's flagrant breach of the rules shows the utter contempt he has for democracy and ridding politics of vested interests, and raises serious questions about why he was so desperate to start writing for the Telegraph again. ""The system is clearly not working when the former foreign secretary can simply ignore the official body that oversees appointments seemingly without any consequences. ""A drastic overhaul of this toothless body is urgently needed so we can put an end to politicians and the establishment working only for the interests of themselves."" His comments echoa report by a cross-party committee of MPs,external, in April, which described Acoba as ""a toothless regulator which has failed to change the environment around business appointments"". The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs committee called for urgent reform of the watchdog to improve public trust. Mr Johnson resigned from the government over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit policy on 9 July, signed the contract on 12 July and referred himself to the committee on 26 July, the letter says. The former London mayor has previously worked as a journalist, and earned almost Â£23,000 a month writing for the Daily Telegraph before being appointed as foreign secretary last year. His latest weekly Telegraph column has triggered a row over remarks he made about Muslim women wearing the burka.

"Emma's Diary offers free products and discount coupons A parenting advice site has been fined Â£140,000 after it was accused of illegally collecting data and selling it on for use by the Labour Party, which used it to profile new mums. Emma's Diary gathered data on more than a million people, according to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which issued the fine. Labour used the information in the run up to the 2017 General Election. Lifecycle Marketing, which owns Emma's Diary, apologised in a statement. ""We had never previously provided data to a political party and we will never do so again,"" the firm said. ""We have always sought to fully comply with our data protection obligations, which we take extremely seriously, we are sorry that on this isolated occasion our interpretation of the [data protection act] has not been in line with the ICO's."" Political parties commonly buy personal information to target their campaigns, but they must obtain appropriate consent from the providers. A spokesman for Labour said: ""We have neither bought nor used Emma's Diary data since the 2017 General Election and we are in the process of reviewing our approach to acquiring data from third parties."" ""The relationship between data brokers, political parties and campaigns is complex,"" said Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner. ""Even though this company was not directly involved in political campaigning, the democratic process must be transparent."" The ICO said that Emma's Diary originally sold 1,065,200 records to a branch of credit reference agency Experian, specifically for use by Labour. Each record included: the name of the parent who had joined Emma's Diary their home address whether children up to the age of five were present the birth dates of the mother and children Labour used a database created by Experian to profile new mums. Then, women living in areas with marginal seats were targeted with direct mail marketing by Labour. The ICO has notified all of the UK's 11 main political parties that it will audit their data-sharing practices in 2018. Issuing the fine showed that the ICO was ""willing to use its teeth"", said Frederike Kaltheuner at campaign group Privacy International. ""The industry is quite murky,"" she told the BBC, pointing out that consumers may - for example - see statements such as ""data may be shared for marketing purposes"" in all sorts of places but not realise the extent of how their personal information could be used. ""I think the ICO was quite clear in their analysis... You have to be very clear and transparent about what you do with data,"" she said.

"Northamptonshire County Council approved an action plan for ""radical"" cuts to services A cash-strapped council has approved massive cuts to jobs and services in a bid to tackle a Â£70m funding shortfall. Northamptonshire County Council backed theaction plan to reduce spendingduring a crisis meeting. Children's services, road maintenance and waste management are among the areas facing ""radical"" cuts. Council leader, Conservative Matt Golby, described it as ""the most challenging thing me and my colleagues have ever been faced with"". All but one of the Conservative councillors backed the action plan earlier, while opposition groups voted against. Reality Check: What do councils have to do? The council will now work out what impact this will have on individual services and jobs. The governmentsent in commissioners to oversee Northamptonshirein April after the authority revealed a projected overspend of Â£21m for 2017-18. However, the authority was forced to issue a second spending control order to stave off a projected budget shortfall of Â£60m-Â£70m this financial year. About 20 people gathered outside County Hall to protest against cuts Liberal Democrat councillor Dennis Meredith criticised the fact the Whitehall commissioners are being paid Â£1,500 a day - with the cash-strapped council allegedly picking up the bill. ""I think that's a scandal,"" he said. ""We need to send you back to London. It's only 60 miles."" A small group gathered outside County Hall ahead of the meeting to protest against the cuts, including Alvarez Wilkinson from the Unison union in Northamptonshire. He said: ""We'll be losing a lot of staff and, when you lose a member of staff, you also lose a service. Some messages of protest were chalked outside where the meeting was being held ""I live in the county and as services disappear, I really worry about the welfare of my family."" As it started, a member of the public blasted the Tory councillors who were not present -a total of 15 failed to attend the meeting. Bianca Todd said: ""There are county councillors who are not here today. You have got to be kidding me. We're making national news. ""When people die this winter, because they will die this winter, the blood will be on your hands."" The story behind the cash-crisis council Cash-crisis council: Your thoughts Reality Check: What do councils have to do? Jenny Cotton-Howells from Spectrum, a charity supporting people with learning difficulties, said she was ""worried"" about further cuts to services but ""had faith"" in the council to make ""the right decisions"". She added: ""Any further cuts would be absolutely catastrophic. They cannot cut an already cut service to the bone."" Summarising the debate, Mr Golby vowed to ""not put people at risk"". ""That's not what we're about. We're not going to give up,"" he said. ""We have got to make sure that we provide the services we can. We will meet our statutory duties and I'm happy to say that. ""Do we understand the implications? Yes."" This video can not be played New mother Rachael Ball says she worries over plans to close 21 libraries in Northamptonshire Chief finance officer Mark McLaughlin told the meeting the council ""cannot continue to spend money it doesn't have"" and admitted some previous actions were ""clearly wrong"", but he said the challenge could be ""turned into a success"". Labour group leader Bob Scott said past decisions had been ""catastrophic"" and his group would not vote to harm the people of Northamptonshire, while Lib Dem group leader Chris Stanbra said there were ""unanswered questions"" about ""who knew what and when"" during the crisis. Speaking after the meeting, Northampton South MP Andrew Lewer said it was vital to ""change the relationship between Westminster, Whitehall and local government"" in future. He recognised ""local mismanagement"" was to blame for the council's situation but said it should serve as ""a warning not just for Northamptonshire, but for the rest of the country"". In Tory mythology it is free-spending ""loony left"" Labour councils that get into financial difficulties, not prudent Conservative ones. The reality has never been quite like that. The last time a council went bankrupt, in Hackney, East London, in 2000, it was run by a Labour/Tory coalition. But there is more to the Northamptonshire County Council crisis than embarrassment for Theresa May's government - although that is acute enough, given that the council stuck rigidly to the government's spending guidelines. Local councils have borne the brunt of austerity, with central government funding falling by about half since 2010. If, as some predict, it is not the last council to go under, this will become a national crisis, not a local one, something Labour has been predicting for a long time.

However, the National Audit Office (NAO) has warnedas many as one in 10 larger local authorities in England with responsibility for social care,externalare draining their reserves and will have exhausted them completely in three years unless something changes. Vulnerable children facing 'catastrophe' Commissioners take over troubled council Cash-strapped council to sell Â£53m HQ It projected that another one in 10 would run out within five years. These reserves are sometimes seen as ""rainy day"" funds. They are there for unplanned expenses or planned one-off costs. They do not get topped back up again unless the council finds the money from somewhere else. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""The financial challenges facing Northamptonshire council are clearly serious and reinforce how important it was that we took swift action to appoint commissioners. ""These commissioners will continue to work closely with the council as it takes the necessary steps to rebalance its finances.""

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties At least 29 children have been killed and 30 wounded in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in Yemen, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The children were travelling on a bus that was hit at a market in Dahyan, in the northern province of Saada. The health ministry run by the rebel Houthi movement put the death toll at 43, and said 61 people were wounded. The coalition, which is backing Yemen's government in a war with the Houthis, said its actions were ""legitimate"". It insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. Meanwhile the new UN special envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, is planning to invite the warring parties to Geneva in September to discuss a framework for negotiations. This video can not be played UN envoy Martin Griffiths says that if peace efforts in Yemen fail, the world could be looking at âSyria-plus"". He told the BBC's Lyse Doucet that if the conflict is left unresolved, Yemen could collapse and the international community could be looking at ""Syria-plus"" in the years to come. ""The war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even more than it is now."" Yemeni tribal elders told the Associated Press that the bus was hit as it passed through Dahyan market,externaland that it was transporting local civilians, including many school children. The charity Save the Children said it had been told by its staff that the children were on their way back to school from a picnic,externalwhen the driver of their bus stopped to get a drink. The vehicle was stationary when the attack happened, it added. The ICRC said it was sending extra supplies to help hospitals deal with the influx The ICRC said a hospital it supported in Saada had received the bodies of 29 children,external, all of them under the age of 15, and 48 injured people, among them 30 children. It sent additional supplies to the hospital to cope with the influx of patients. Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that 47 people were killed and 77 wounded, and broadcast graphic pictures showing the bodies of several young children, some of them wearing school uniform. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam accused the coalition of showing ""clear disregard for civilian life"" by targeting a crowded public place. Allow Twitter content?

The ICRC stressed that ""under international humanitarian law, civilians must be protected during conflict"", whilethe secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland called it a ""grotesque, shameful"" attack,externalthat showed ""blatant disregard for rules of war"". Save the Children described the incident as ""horrific"", and called for a full, immediate and independent investigation into recent attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. It was not immediately clear whether the bus was the target of the air strike, butcoalition spokesman Col Turki al-Malki said the attack was ""a legitimate military action,external, conducted in conformity with international humanitarian law"". Air strikes were reported in the rebel-held capital of Sanaa later on Thursday He said it had hit ""militants responsible for planning and targeting civilians"" in the southern Saudi city of Jizan on Wednesday night, where one Yemeni resident was killed and 11 others were injured by fragments from an intercepted ballistic missile that was launched by the Houthis from neighbouring Amran province. He accused the rebels of using children as ""tools and covers for their terrorist acts"". Later, air strikes were reported in the rebel-held Yemeni capital, Sanaa. A week ago, at least 55 civilians were killed and 170 others wounded in a series of attacks on the rebel-held Red Sea port city of Hudaydah. The coalition denied that it had carried out air strikes in the area, and blamed the deaths on rebel mortar fire. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

"This video can not be played The moment an aftershock hit Lombok The death toll from a magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday has risen to 259 and may go higher still, officials say. The region has been hit by more than 350 aftershocks, the worst of which struck on Thursday. The latest tremor had a magnitude of 5.9 or 6.2, according to monitors. It brought down some buildings. Rescue workers are still digging through rubble and trying to get aid to survivors of the earlier, larger quake. Officials said of the latest death toll: ""This number will continue increasing as rescue teams continue to find victims under collapsed buildings."" Indonesia's chief security minister had earlier said 319 people had died, while local media have reported figures as high as 347. But national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the BBC that only 259 deaths had been verified. Facebook regrets insensitive quake balloons 'People had shards of glass in their legs' In pictures: Damaged homes and evacuations in Lombok The Red Cross says that Sunday's incident was ""exceptionally destructive"". Some villages had ""completely collapsed"", said a Red Cross official in Lombok, Christopher Rassi. The government says more than 1,400 people were injured and more than 270,000 displaced. The new tremor on Thursday hit off the north-west coast of Lombok, sending people running into the streets in panic. No tsunami warning was issued. By Mehulika Sitepu, BBC News, Mataram More than 350 aftershocks have struck since the quake on Sunday. Usually it feels like the ground is gently swaying. But Thursday's aftershock was different. In my third-floor hotel room in Mataram, the island's capital, windows smashed, walls cracked and the ceiling started to collapse. I ran as fast as I could, barefoot, taking nothing with me. The stairs shook as I ran from the building into the street outside, where people were crying. Their fear was clearly visible. Sturdy buildings such as my hotel, in the north of Lombok and 13km (8 miles) from the epicentre, can withstand such shocks. But the rickety houses where many islanders live cannot. This is why so many people here are now homeless. Mr Sutopo classified it as an aftershock. A British tourist on nearby Bali told the BBC that it had been felt there, causing people to leave their hotel rooms in the southern resort area of Seminyak. Emergency workers are gradually starting to reach more remote areas of Lombok as they continue their rescue missions. But Mr Sutopo said some areas in the north had still not received any aid.

Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. Most people live in basic housing in small communities. Tens of thousands are now sleeping out in the open or in the ruins of their homes. This woman was rescued alive after nearly a week trapped under rubble in Tanjung, North Lombok ""We are still waiting for assessments from some of the more remote areas in the north of the island, but it is already clear that Sunday's earthquake was exceptionally destructive,"" said Mr Rassi. ""I visited villages yesterday that were completely collapsed,"" he added, while other teams in East and North Lombok had reported villages where 75% of homes were damaged. With hospitals and clinics also affected, many of the injured have had to be treated in the open air or in makeshift clinics. This video can not be played Imam stays as quake hits Bali mosque Sunday's quake came only days after a slightly smaller one, which killed at least 16 people. There are growing concerns that the important tourism industry will be badly hit at what should be a busy time. Thousands of tourists visiting Lombok - as well as the nearby Gili Islands and Bali - have been evacuated or have chosen to leave since the weekend. ""We've had light earthquakes in the past, but never anything like this,"" hotel chain owner Marcel De Rijk told Reuters news agency. ""We've lost a lot of bookings and future guests are in wait-and-see mode. I don't think people will choose Lombok anymore this summer."" The quake struck at 19:46 local time (11:46 GMT) on Sunday at a fairly shallow depth of 31km (19 miles). Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

It is the weirdest thing, he is so left footed and a 6'3 player who plays on the right. But when you get him on that left foot he is just about unstoppable. If you haven't watched him before he's absolutely brilliant.

We set out to sign players to replace the ones we lost, and get players of the right type. We all agreed very early there are profiles of players we wanted, we got the keeper we wanted to add and happy with Vicente
Guaita. ""We had to replace the midfielders we lost and add a different type of forward
to the one we had. We pursued these players for a while, it took a while to get
Jordan Ayew over the line, so delighted with the players we brought in.

This video can not be played Eddie Mair plays Bring Me Sunshine to end his final BBC Radio show The presenter announced in Julyhe was leaving the BBC after more than 30 years. He has been signed by commercial station LBC. PM presenter Eddie Mair 'offered to take pay cut' The 52-year-old had been a presenter on Radio 4's PM programme since 1998. Paddy O'Connell is guest presenting PM for Thursday and Carolyn Quinn on Friday. Mair's full-time replacement has still to be announced. There will be a number of stand in presenters over the next few weeks including Chris Mason, Sarah Smith and Jonny Dymond with Carolyn Quinn. Mair will join LBC in September. It hasn't been announced yet which time slot his show will be in. He will continue to present the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Podcast for the BBC until November. Hello I'm sorry I'm not in the office today as planned. I seem to have picked up one of those 48 hour bugs. Atishoo. Thank you Paddy for stepping in. Coincidentally, I want to tell you about what happened just after PM finished last night. As you may know, we finished the show with a full rendition by Willie Nelson of 'Bring Me Sunshine'. It was, in keeping with the tradition of PM, a suggestion by a listener. Making the show yesterday had been tortuous for everyone on a quiet news day but in the end, I think we made something pretty good. Eloise and I looked at each other after the meeting and agreed that there was no way to match that for a last Eddie programme. So, that's what it wasâ¦my last PM. It felt right then and it feels right now. No fuss or faff, just as I wanted. Genuinely unplanned, and with its origins in a listener idea. Perfect. Or as close to perfect as we're likely to get. I hate saying goodboo. Sorryâ¦goodbee. Noâ¦goodbiy. Dammit. I still can't say it. What I do say is this. One of the biggest struggles I had in deciding whether to leave is a truth we both understand. Yes I bring something to PM and I have talents and abilities that help the programme. But I also understand completely that the work of all the people on PM make me sound much much better than my own abilities can muster. This is just a truth. And what I wrestled with was, in essence, 'can I manage without them?' I don't know the answer to that but it's high time I tried. Working with you all has been the joy of my professional life. There is a rich deep seam of talent in our department and I've been privileged to be part of it. Thank you for everything you've done for PM, iPM and hundreds of years ago in my case, BH. I am literally missing you already. From what I know of the plans for the department, PM is about to get a brilliant editor. The show, about which I care so much, is about to get even better. So this old fart is buggering off and leaving you to do what you all do brilliantly. Thank you.

"This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works The Russian rouble has slumped to its lowest level since November 2016, hours after the US announced new sanctions because of the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter in the UK. The dollar-rouble rate reached 66.7 on the Moscow stock exchange. On Tuesday the rate had been 63.4. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in March, though they have now recovered. Russia denies any role in the attack. The share values of major Russian firms, including Aeroflot, Rusal and Sberbank, also fell several percentage points in Moscow on Thursday. The euro also gained against the rouble, which slumped to a rate of 76.8. Speaking at a briefing later on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would be preparing a response to ""this unfriendly act"" by the US. She did not elaborate. Ms Zakharova also accused the US of trying to ""demonise"" Russia. A UK investigation blamed Russia for the Novichok attack. Mr Skripal and his daughter recovered after intensive care in hospital, and their current whereabouts are being kept secret. Parts of the city of Salisbury were sealed off after the nerve agent attack The attack prompted the UK and its Western allies to expel many Russian diplomats - and Russia retaliated with its own expulsions. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the US,externalon Thursday in a tweet. He said nerve agents and other ""horrific"" weapons must not become a new norm, and ""states like Russia that use or condone their use need to know there is a price to pay"". Russia has criticised the new US sanctions as ""draconian"". On Wednesday US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it had been determined that Russia ""has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law, or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals"". What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? Will Salisbury poison suspects face UK trial? What are nerve agents and what do they do? Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury The Russian embassy in the US hit back on Thursday morning. Russia had become ""accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence"", it said, adding: ""We continue to strongly stand for an open and transparent investigation of the crime committed in Salisbury."" The new sanctions will take effect on or around 22 August. They cover exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies that can have military applications. There will also be some further restrictions on Russian access to US financial services. The state department says ""more draconian"" sanctions will follow within 90 days if Russia fails to give reliable assurances that it will no longer use chemical weapons and will allow on-site inspections by the United Nations. The threatened measures include a far-reaching trade embargo on Russia - but excluding food - and a ban on Aeroflot flights to the US. An official said it was only the third time that the US had determined a country had used chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals. Previous occasions were against Syria and against North Korea for the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of leader Kim Jong-un, who died when highly toxic VX nerve agent was rubbed on his face at Kuala Lumpur airport. No. In June the US imposed sanctions on five Russian companies and three Russian individuals in response to alleged Russian cyber-attacks on the US. All are prohibited from any transactions involving the US financial system. The US and EU also have sanctions in place against dozens of Russian state officials and firms accused of involvement in the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and support for the separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Those sanctions restrict travel and financial transactions. Analysis by Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington After pressure from Republican members of Congress, the state department has determined Moscow broke international law by using a military-grade chemical weapon on the Skripals. While the US expelled some five dozen diplomats shortly after the poisoning, the administration stopped short of making a formal determination that Russia had broken international law. But Congress has been pushing for such a decision and now the state department has confirmed Russia's actions contravened 1991 US legislation on the use of chemical weapons.  That breach automatically triggers the imposition of sanctions and places requirements on Russia to avert further restrictions in three months' time. So far President Donald Trump has been silent on this latest move - which could well derail his attempts to develop a new, warmer relationship with Vladimir Putin. Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack. Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate-general in Seattle. Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from the city.Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital. After tests, scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had also been exposed to Novichok. Mr Rowleytold ITV News,externalhe had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and given it to Ms Sturgess, who sprayed the substance on her wrists. What happened to the Skripals?

"Yulia Skripal and her father, Sergei, were poisoned in March It is becoming clear, without any official policing sources confirming it, that significant progress has been made in the Salisbury spy poisoning investigation. Detectives from the South East Counter-Terrorism Unit appear to have got to the stage where they have isolated two people from CCTV images as their prime suspects in the suspected nerve agent poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March. The attack led, three months later,to the subsequent death of Dawn Sturgess, and the accidental contamination of her partner Charlie Rowley. At this stage no-one has confirmed officially that the two suspects have been fully identified by their real names, but a discussion has begun between counter-terrorism officers, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the intelligence agencies as to what is the best way forward. The key question in those discussions is whether the UK should make a formal request to Russia for the two people suspected of carrying out the Novichok attack to be sent to the UK for trial. We know from thecase of Alexander Litvinenko, killed in London in 2006,that such a request would be unsuccessful, because Russia would simply refuse. In the Litvinenko case Russia said it could not, under its constitution, send Russian citizens for trial in the UK. The two Litvinenko suspects - Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - are still both living as free men in Russia, although neither can leave the country, as they know they risk being arrested on behalf of the UK. Andrei Lugovoi has made a successful career as a member of the Duma, the Russian parliament. He has made a virtue of enjoying visiting all the wildest parts of his huge country instead of travelling overseas. On one of the times I met him he was fishing and horse-riding in Kamchatka, a remote volcanic peninsula in the far east of Russia. Daniel Sandford (l) met Andrei Lugovoi (r) on a fishing trip in eastern Russia in 2011 So, making an extradition request will produce a firm ""nyet"" from Moscow, but would at least allow the UK to show that it has identified two suspects. It would not help relations between the UK and Russia although these are at an all-time low anyway since the break-up of the Soviet Union. However, not making a request would leave Russia guessing and mean that the two suspects would not know if they had been fully identified and would leave them permanently worried about leaving Russia. This may seem like quite an attractive option, but would allow Russia to continue to say that the initial British government accusations were baseless, and not supported by any evidence. A third option is to do what ultimately happened in the Litvinenko case, and hold a public inquiry in which as much as possible of the evidence is laid out for everyone to see. Of course, this third option does not rule out making an extradition request initially, and then proceeding to a public inquiry when the request is refused. Whitehall officials continue to say that this is a police investigation, but ultimately some political decisions will have to be made about how to proceed.

"This video can not be played Supporters and opponents of the bill to expand abortion rights clashed in Buenos Aires Argentina's senate has rejected a bill which would have legalised abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. After a marathon debate, 38 senators voted against it and 31 in favour. Its defeat means lawmakers must wait until next year to resubmit legislation. Currently abortion is allowed in Argentina only in cases of rape, or if the mother's health is in danger. Some pro-choice campaigners started fires and lobbed missiles at police in Buenos Aires after the vote. Demonstrators on both sides of the debate had rallied outside parliament as voting took place. No going back in Argentina's abortion debate The women protesting in the Argentina abortion debate The modern face of the 'DIY abortion' Anti-abortion activists have been jubilant. ""It's a joy to see that our society can be based on such an important principle as the defence of the most defenceless, the child,"" said one. Pro-choice campaigners have for years tried to get bills passed in Argentina, where the population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Their efforts gained new impetus when President Mauricio Macri - who opposes abortion - called on Congress to consider a vote on it, and it narrowly passed in the lower house. However, with the Senate leaning conservative, the bill's passage always looked difficult. Among the 30 women in the chamber, the vote was evenly split. The debate lasted more than 16 hours in an often fraught session. Argentine Vice-President Gabriela Michetti, who also opposes abortion, was heard swearing at colleagues without realising her microphone was on One pro-choice Senator, Pedro Guastavino, said he had been lobbied heavily by the Catholic Church, saying he had had to ""dodge crucifixes"" Senator Rodolfo Urtubey, who opposed the bill, sparked controversy by suggesting rape inside marriage did not conform to the ""classic"" definition of rape because - in his view - it did not always involve violence. He later said he had been misinterpreted Former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, who is now a senator and who had refused to back the legalisation of abortion while president, supported the bill, saying her mind had been changed by the thousands who took to the streets Pro-choice campaigners consoled each other after the vote... ... but anti-abortion campaigners were ecstatic For the bill's advocates, legalising abortion is an urgent public health matter. Tens of thousands of women in Argentina are taken to hospital every year after illegal abortions. In 2016, 43 women died. Those that can afford it use drugs to terminate their pregnancies while poorer women turn to far cruder methods. Uruguay and Cuba are the only Latin American nations to have decriminalised abortion. It is largely prohibited across the region except in restricted cases. El Salvador: Where women may be jailed for miscarrying The Supreme Court in Latin America's most populous country Brazil has begun hearing from both sides on whether abortion should be legalised up to 12 weeks. In May, another largely Catholic country, the Republic of Ireland, voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to overturn a ban on abortion. The global trend has been towards legalisation but the debate continues - in the US, for instance, changes to the Supreme Court has led tospeculation abortion could be made illegal in some states. ""This law doesn't obligate, nor does it recommend anyone have an abortion. The only thing this law does is defend the right to choose.""Norma Durango, from the opposition Peronist party ""The message that we wanted to put across is that abortion equals social failure. For a woman to resort to it, many other things need to have failed first.""Camila Duro of the anti-abortion non-governmental organisation Frente Joven ""Women perform abortions with criminalisation or without it.""Sabrina Cartabia Groba, pro-choice lawyer and campaigner ""Abortion always kills a child and it doesn't solve the woman's problem. We believe that this is never the solution. Faced with an unexpected pregnancy abortion is never the solution. There are always other solutions.""Maria Castillo, who campaigned outside parliament The two sides in the debate Women in their own words New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"(Left to right) Robin Stewart from the Reach Project, Michael Stone, Karen Stone, DUP East Belfast Councillor George Dorrian, former DUP MLA Sammy Douglas The brother of a man murdered by a multiple killer said he should have been informed that he is on temporary release. Loyalist Michael Stone was convicted of murdering Roddy Hackett's brother Dermot in 1987. Stone opened a sale of his artwork in east Belfast in July while on overnight leave from Maghaberry Prison. He was convicted of killing six people during the Troubles and is coming to the end of a 30-year sentence. According to the Northern Ireland Prison Service, victims have to register with a special scheme before they receive information about a prisoner's release date or any periods of temporary release. A pair of paintings by loyalist Michael Stone In July, Stone opened an exhibition of 24 of his paintings while out on an unsupervised temporary release day at the Reach Project on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast. Money was raised at the exhibition for Muscular Dystrophy UK but the charity has said it will not accept donations from the event. ""We were not aware that Mr Stone had work on show at the Milestones exhibition,"" a spokesperson for Muscular Dystrophy UK said. ""We understand the sensitivities in Northern Ireland about an exhibition including his paintings. After careful consideration, we will be declining the money raised at the event."" Also present at the launch of his art sale were the Grand Secretary of the Orange Order Mervyn Gibson, former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Sammy Douglas and east Belfast DUP councillor George Dorrian. Mr Gibson told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme he attended the event in his role as a ""local minister and also a community activist who has been involved in peace building for many years"". He said that he supported an Orange Order decision not to meet with Sinn FÃ©in but added there was ""no inconsistency in me, as an individual, going to such an exhibition"". ""Over the years I have met many senior Sinn FÃ©in officials who were terrorists, and I do so in the interests of progress and building peace."" This video can not be played The art of a killer - Michael Stone opens art show during jail release A DUP spokesperson said: ""Councillor Dorrian, like all DUP representatives, condemns all acts of terrorism, including the evil deeds committed by Michael Stone."" As a long-term prisoner, Stone is entitled to one 24-hour temporary release day every four weeks in the run up to his final release. As well as killing three mourners during a gun and grenade attack in Milltown Cemetery in 1988, Stone was convicted of murdering three other Catholics in separate gun attacks, including County Tyrone bread server Dermot Hackett who was found dead in his van between Drumquin and Omagh in 1987. Dermot Hackett was 37 when he was murdered ""We should have been notified,"" his brother Roddy said. ""I would hate to think that some of my immediate family happened to walk up the street in Belfast and see him walking towards them. ""I think it would be an awful shock for them, especially Dermot's family. ""It is only right that they should have let us know,"" he added. Stone opened his exhibition on 9 July and it remained open to the public for two days. Some of the 24 paintings in the display seemed to explore loyalist themes Called Milestones 2018, the programme said it was an exhibition of works by ""east Belfast artists Michael and Karen Stone"". Michael Stone married Karen Stone in a ceremony in Maghaberry Prison two years ago. It is understood some of his paintings were sold, with a sign at the launch saying: ""All small paintings Â£150.00."" The exhibition venue was inside the Reach Project, which was set up by ex-members ofthe loyalist Red Hand Commando paramilitary group. Its mission statement said it aims to help ""move people forward into a more peaceful and equitable society"". Reach chairman Jim Wilson described Michael Stone's paintings as ""very special and very interesting to our people and the people of east Belfast in general"". ""Michael Stone is like any other human being,"" he said. ""He has had a past. He is now hoping to have a different future. ""I think it was [David] Trimble who said, if you have a past it does not mean that you can't have a future. If this man is moving into a new phase in his life, he should be allowed to do so. ""For a guy who has been involved in what he has been involved in, I think he is transforming very well. ""That is the transformation we would like to see from all who are ex-combatants."" Asked if he accepted that some may consider Michael Stone's work as offensive, Mr Wilson said:  ""I understand the hurt and pain Michael may have foisted on other families, but it happened on our side as well. ""It was not just Michael Stone who did things wrong in the past. ""People who are administering this government did things wrong in the past."" On 16 March 1988, Michael Stone murdered three mourners during a solo gun and grenade attack on republican funerals at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast. Thomas McErlean, John Murray and Kevin Brady were killed and dozens more were wounded. Three-and-a-half years previously, in November 1984, he murdered milkman Patrick Brady in south Belfast. The following year he shot Kevin McPolin in Lisburn, County Antrim, before killing Dermot Hackett in 1987. Stone also confessed to a series of plots to kill, including a failed bid to assassinate Sinn FÃ©in leader Martin McGuinness. A selection of paintings by Michael Stone He was given a 30-year jail sentence for the six murders, but was freed on licence for a six-year period under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which gave early release to many paramilitary prisoners. Stone was returned to jail after a botched attack at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in November 2006 when armed with explosives, knives and an axe he tried to get inside and kill Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams. He later denied trying to kill the Sinn FÃ©in politicians andsaid it was simply ""an act of performance art"".,external In 2013, Lord Chief justice Sir Declan Morgan ruled that Stone would have to serve a minimum of 30 years in jail for the Milltown killings. This decision meant that Stone could not be considered for release until 2018. It is believed he was turned down for being given a specific release date earlier this year but is currently on a temporary release scheme where he is allowed to leave the prison unaccompanied overnight as part of his pre-release programme. The Department of Justice said a Prisoner Release Victim Information Scheme is in existence. A spokesperson said: ""It is a scheme which provides for victims of crime or where the victim is deceased, the family of the victim, to register to receive information about a prisoner's sentence, about any periods of temporary release from prison for which a prisoner is being considered and about their release from prison at the end of their period in custody. ""The scheme also provides for the written submission to the Prison Service of any concerns victim's (or) victim's family's have about a prisoner's release.""

"A neighbour had just walked past when an explosion tore through a small, white house in the Spanish coastal town of Alcanar last August. Debris was flung hundreds of metres by the force of the blast and the bodies of two men landed in nearby gardens. A third man who had been on a roof terrace talking on his phone survived. The next day a van attack was launched on pedestrians in Barcelona's central tourist avenue, Las Ramblas. Hours later there was another attack, in Cambrils, a coastal town. Sixteen people died and more than 130 were injured. Catalonia had come under attack from a jihadist gang of 11 people. Youssef Aalla and Younes Abouyaaqoub preparing an explosive belt at a house in Alcanar Investigators believe they had planned to target Barcelona's Sagrada Familia and the Camp Nou stadium, home to Barcelona football club. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was another target. The Alcanar blast late on 16 August had changed all that and the key figure, Abdelbaki Es Satty, lay dead in the rubble. Barcelona attacks: What we know Aftermath of attacks - in pictures Who are the Barcelona suspects? But this is also a story of missed clues and intelligence failings, because Es Satty had been known to the authorities for years. And the BBC has learned that his gang of extremists was plugged into a network that, according to a surviving cell member, could have included another imam with a second cell of eight or nine young men in France. A year on, investigators in France have requested information from 10 countries and are still trying to break up that network and identify a possible French cell. Catalonia's head of counter-terrorism believes the plot could have been masterminded by someone outside Spain. As neighbours emerged from the destroyed buildings in Alcanar, no-one considered an extremist link. The bodies of Es Satty, 44, and 22-year-old Youssef Aallaa were identified. The house in Alcanar was all but destroyed by the explosion ""The strongest hypothesis was that it was a drugs lab,"" said firefighter Jordi Bort, who was among the first on the scene. It was not until emergency services had dug through the rubble the next day that the full picture emerged. There was a second blast, almost as large as the first. Nine firefighters were injured. They had stumbled on a bomb factory containing more than 200kg (440lb) of explosives. Much of it was extremely unstable, designed to cause multiple deaths. Younes Abouyaaqoub and Youssef Aalla posing as they prepare hand grenades at a house in Alcanar There were canisters, nails, large quantities of acetone, hydrogen peroxide, bicarbonate and detonator switches - all the ingredients to create TATP (triacetone triperoxide) explosive. They also found grenades and suicide vests. Investigators only discovered later, from material recovered from digital cameras, computers and mobile phones, that the men had planned to use these explosives at some of Europe's biggest landmarks. It was on the afternoon of 17 August that 22-year-old Younes Abouyaaqoub jumped into a rented white van and zig-zagged down Las Ramblas at high speed, careering into pedestrians along the packed avenue. Witnesses said the driver had tried to hit as many people as possible. Many were knocked to the ground while others fled for cover in nearby shops and cafes. Abouyaaqoub killed 13 people and injured more than 130 before fleeing on foot. He then hijacked a white Ford Focus, killing the driver. A German woman injured on Las Ramblas later died, taking the death toll to 15. Eight hours later, in the early hours of 18 August, five men drove to Cambrils, 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. They were the Barcelona attacker's brother, Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, along with Moussa Oukabir, Said Aallaa and brothers Mohamed and Omar Hychami. Their black Audi A3 car ploughed into pedestrians at the seaside resort and overturned before the gang got out wielding knives and an axe.  A Spanish woman was killed and several others wounded. Who were the victims? Written on the trees of the Ramblas The attackers were wearing fake suicide vests adorned with plastic bottles to create panic. The vests also ensured they would be shot by police and, in their eyes, die as martyrs. Barcelona attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub was still on the run. His journey finally came to an end on 21 August in a field west of Barcelona. Police were tipped off by the public and Abouyaaqoub, wearing a fake explosives belt, was shot dead. The young men behind the attacks had claimed 16 lives. Who was behind these murders? Ninety minutes' drive inland from Barcelona, on the edge of the Pyrenees, lies the picturesque town of Ripoll. Surrounded by pine trees and mountain rivers, this is where most of the Catalan terror cell grew up. They were all first- or second-generation immigrants from Morocco and most were childhood friends who went to the same school. They included four sets of brothers. By all accounts they were normal kids who played in the local football teams, went to after-school clubs and took part in hiking trips. Cambrils attacker Houssaine Abouyaaqoub was known as Houssa and was part of the local football team. When they were boys they played football together Social worker Nuria Perpinya helped some of them at a school homework club. ""They would go there after school to use the computers because they didn't have a computer or any internet connection at home,"" she said. ""They were like all the kids,"" wrote Raquel Rull, the mother of one of Houssa's friends, in an emotional letter published after the attacks. ""Like the one you see playing in the square, or the one who carries a big school bag filled with books, or the one who says 'Hi' and lets you go first in the supermarket queue, or the one who gets nervous when a girl smiles at him."" The youngest member of the cell, Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, was known to friends as Houssa Apart from the older Es Satty, only Driss Oukabir, the eldest of the boys, was known to the authorities. He had a criminal record for robbery, sexual assault and domestic violence, but even then his conduct had attracted little attention. Driss Oukabir ""enjoyed life"" with his girlfriend and his dog On leaving school, most of them had gone to work in local factories, cafes and restaurants. Then Abdelbaki Es Satty arrived and started working at one of the town's two mosques, saying he was an imam. Born in Morocco's Rif mountain region, he had come to Spain in the early 2000s and had been in and out of prison until he was brought to Ripoll by a Moroccan woodcutter during the spring of 2015. Abdelbaki Es Satty arrived in Ripoll in 2015 For Ibrahim Aallaa, whose sons Said and Youssef were killed at Alcanar and Cambrils, Es Satty was a ""bad influence"" and he did not like him. He had twice visited the house uninvited when he thought Ibrahim was not at home. Said had been working in a local cafe and Es Satty said he should stop as it served alcohol and pork. Youssef had been told to stop working during Ramadan. Es Satty's flat overlooked Ripoll ""Es Satty's belief was too strict,"" Ibrahim said. ""It was an interpretation of Islam that I didn't like. I told my boys too. I didn't want them to go to the mosque and I didn't talk to Es Satty."" By January 2016, Es Satty had left Ripoll in search of new opportunities. He went to Belgium to preach at a mosque in Diegem, outside Brussels. He had told leading members of the community he was an informant for the Spanish intelligence services. Hans Bonte, mayor of Vilvoorde in Belgium, has spoken of intelligence failings related to the case ""They didn't trust him, they asked him for some papers to convince them that he actually was an imam,"" said Hans Bonte, mayor of Vilvoorde. ""But he didn't have a record, so he couldn't give them."" The head of the mosque went to the police and Es Satty's details were put on a national database by a local police officer. The case was due to be discussed by local and national security services, but the officer heard nothing back. The Belgian officer also approached a Catalan counterpart he knew but nothing came of that either. Despite local authorities twice flagging up their concerns, Es Satty returned to Ripoll in April 2016, soon after the Brussels bombings. ""There was a lack of information exchange between Catalan police and the federal Spanish police and that gave a lot of tension between Catalan and Spanish authorities,"" Mayor Bonte said. Es Satty was to return to Brussels several times. Back in Ripoll, Es Satty began work at the town's second mosque. A year before the events in Barcelona, friends of the Ripoll cell members began to notice a change in their behaviour. They stopped wearing branded clothing and visited the mosque more frequently. ""They closed themselves up a little,"" said one. This video can not be played ""They were missing something - a spiritual void, a religious void"" They also made regular trips to the bomb factory in Alcanar. One of the most frequent visitors was Younes Abouyaaqoub, the Barcelona attacker. The house was registered in his name and in Youssef Aalla's. In documents seen by the BBC, the cell searched online for chemistry manuals, various IS leading figures, bomb-making manuals and possible targets to attack. In order to fund the purchase of explosives and their travelling, they stole money from their places of work, and sold gold and jewellery in small towns on the coast. By now, older members of the Ripoll gang were travelling abroad and material found on computers and phones has revealed how the cell was linked to people known to authorities across Europe. There were various trips to Morocco to visit friends and family, especially ahead of the attacks, and one visit to Austria. Es Satty repeatedly travelled to Belgium too, and was last seen there two months before the Catalonia attacks. But there were two other trips that investigators found particularly interesting. In December 2016 Youssef Aallaa and Mohamed Hychami flew to Basel in Switzerland and stayed at the Olympia Hotel in Zurich. Their aim was likely to discuss logistics or financing with figures connected to a controversial An'Nur mosque. The mosque in Winterthur, which has since shut, denies such claims. One week later, those two men joined Younes Abouyaaqoub - who would eventually become the Ramblas attacker - in Brussels. Omar Hychami beside the Eiffel Tower in Paris And days before the Ramblas attack, the man who carried it out, Younes Abouyaaqoub, went to Paris with Omar Hychami. They took the Audi which Hychami was in when it rammed pedestrians in Cambrils. On 11 and 12 August the men's phones were tracked to central Paris as well as the city's Malakoff and Saint-Denis areas. They called contacts who were using pay-as-you-go Sim cards. Investigators believe the Paris trip was part of a mission to find targets for a second cell of jihadists. That target was to be the Eiffel Tower. The question is whether Es Satty and the Ripoll cell were part of something much larger and linked to wider extremist networks and plots in Europe. ""We think there is some brain outside Spain,"" says Manel Castellvi, head of counter-terrorism in Catalonia, ""maybe in Europe, or maybe in a conflict zone, who convinced them to carry out this attack."" This video can not be played Senior police officials believe an outside mastermind was involved. While the TATP explosives they amassed in Alcanar were relatively easy to get hold of, Mr Castellvi believes the quantity they had, as well as their ability to make the explosives, suggests ""someone with important knowledge could have given information to the cell"". The BBC has also learned that Es Satty had booked a flight from Barcelona to Brussels for October 2017 - suggesting Es Satty was not planning to kill himself like the others. Es Satty had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but decisive action was never taken. When the alarm was raised in Brussels in 2016, there was a failure to communicate between Belgium and Spain, and within Spain itself. But the failings go back much further than that. Es Satty was on their radar for links to jihadists as early as 2005. He was living in Vilanova i la Geltru, a coastal town near Barcelona, and spent time with an Algerian man called Belgacem Belil. The pair were connected to a network known as the Vilanova cell. Abdelbaki Es Satty's phone was tapped twice by Spanish authorities Belil became a suicide bomber in Iraq, killing 28 people in November 2003. Members of the cell were investigated for sending people to Syria and Iraq and were connected to people involved in the 2004 Madrid bombings. However, initial convictions handed down to them were quashed. Then, in 2005, Spanish authorities sought approval to tap Es Satty's phone. They believed he could be acting as an intermediary with individuals connected to militant group Ansar al Islam. Not finding enough evidence, the phone tap was lifted but, at some point, his name was added to a European database of people who support terrorism. In 2010 he was jailed in Castellon, south of Barcelona, for transporting cannabis between Morocco and Spain. While in prison, he was approached by Spain's National Intelligence Centre (CNI), most probably as a possible informant, but he was deemed unreliable. However, he was considered interesting enough for his phone to be tapped when he left prison, the BBC has learned. The CNI wanted to know if he was still in touch with extremists, but again the wire-tap was halted because a judge decided it had failed to yield relevant results. The warning signs were there and opportunities were missed. Abdelbaki Es Satty took several years to move from the fringes of extremist Islam to become the ringleader of a murderous cell in rural northern Spain. Lessons have to be learned about exchanging information, says Manuel Navarrete, Europol's head of counter-terrorism.

"The heatwave is being blamed for record numbers of people going to A&E in England in July. As temperatures soared, attendances reached more than 2.1 million - the highest since records began in 2010. The number of patients waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery also rose to their highest point in more than six years, at 3,517. This is despite a pledge in 2014 by the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to end the ""unacceptable"" waits. The figures are part of a raft of data released on Thursday by NHS England. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Health bodies said the heatwave had added to existing pressures on the NHS, with reports of more people turning up with dehydration, heart failure and kidney problems related to the unusually high temperatures. Prof John Appleby, chief economist of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""July 2018 was the most pressured summer month for A&E departments in recent history, showing that there's no doubt this summer's heatwave has caused severe strain on the NHS."" A&E attendances reached 2,176,022 in July - up from 2,091,318 in June - although attendances have steadily climbed since 2010. The NHS England data also shows,externalthere were 530,000 emergency admissions to A&E, a figure only surpassed once - in May this year - since 2010. The number of patients waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks for routine surgery in June was also at the highest level in a decade, at more than 500,000. The NHS is meant to see 90% of patients who need such operations within 18 weeks, but only 87.8% of patients were seen in that time. The Society for Acute Medicine said the summer was usually a time for frontline staff to ""recharge the batteries"" but that had not happened this year. Dr Nick Scriven, the society's president, said: ""Last year NHS leaders admitted it took until October to recover from winter 2017 and we are now only a few months away from the next onslaught... ""On the plus side, this may have triggered alarm bells earlier than normal and lead to some positive actions being put in place to help us contend with the inevitable winter pressures we will face."" The Royal College of Nursing said the heatwave had placed winter-like strains on the health service. Donna Kinnair, director of nursing policy and practice at the RCN, said nurses were seeing more cases of heart failure, renal failure and dehydration, with older people being particularly at risk. An NHS England spokesman added that there had been an ""unprecedented summer surge"" in July. ""Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in 10 people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours,"" the spokesman said. Separately,a survey,externalof 760,000 people across England on their views of their GP practices showed nearly 40% of patients were unable to get an appointment at the time they wanted. It also found that just 66% of patients who wanted a same-day appointment said they managed to get one. However, nearly 84% described their overall experience of their surgery as very or fairly good. And 68.6% rated their overall experience of making an appointment as good. About a third (35.6%) of patients who wanted to see a GP but found their practice was closed said they ended up going to A&E. The survey of patients in England has been redesigned and now includes 16 to 17-year-olds for the first time, so results cannot be compared to previous years, NHS England said. NHS England also released data on waiting times for young people being treated for eating disorders. In 2016 it introduced waiting time targets to ensure fast treatment for under-19s with eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. NHS England's figures showed that the proportion of routine cases being seen within the four-week target has risen from 79.9% to 81.2% on the previous quarter. That means 1,243 children and young people out of a total of 1,530 were seen within the target. But the number of urgent cases seen within the target of one week fell from 78.9% to 74.7% - equivalent to 219 young people out of a total of 293. Andrew Radford, chief executive of Beat, the eating disorder charity, said there was still a postcode lottery on how long children and young people were waiting for treatment. An NHS England spokesman said there had been a significant improvement in treatment times for NHS care. ""An extra Â£30m is going into children's eating disorder services every year, with 70 new and improved treatment centres set up in 2017, covering the whole of the country to ensure more young people get the right care, at the time, closer to home,"" he said. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The history of the NHS in charts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"This video can not be played The Red Cross said a hospital it supports in Saada had received dozens of casualties At least 29 children have been killed and 30 wounded in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in Yemen, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The children were travelling on a bus that was hit at a market in Dahyan, in the northern province of Saada. The health ministry run by the rebel Houthi movement put the death toll at 43, and said 61 people were wounded. The coalition, which is backing Yemen's government in a war with the Houthis, said its actions were ""legitimate"". It insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. Meanwhile the new UN special envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, is planning to invite the warring parties to Geneva in September to discuss a framework for negotiations. This video can not be played UN envoy Martin Griffiths says that if peace efforts in Yemen fail, the world could be looking at âSyria-plus"". He told the BBC's Lyse Doucet that if the conflict is left unresolved, Yemen could collapse and the international community could be looking at ""Syria-plus"" in the years to come. ""The war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even more than it is now."" Yemeni tribal elders told the Associated Press that the bus was hit as it passed through Dahyan market,externaland that it was transporting local civilians, including many school children. The charity Save the Children said it had been told by its staff that the children were on their way back to school from a picnic,externalwhen the driver of their bus stopped to get a drink. The vehicle was stationary when the attack happened, it added. The ICRC said it was sending extra supplies to help hospitals deal with the influx The ICRC said a hospital it supported in Saada had received the bodies of 29 children,external, all of them under the age of 15, and 48 injured people, among them 30 children. It sent additional supplies to the hospital to cope with the influx of patients. Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV reported that 47 people were killed and 77 wounded, and broadcast graphic pictures showing the bodies of several young children, some of them wearing school uniform. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam accused the coalition of showing ""clear disregard for civilian life"" by targeting a crowded public place. Allow Twitter content?

A week ago, at least 55 civilians were killed and 170 others wounded in a series of attacks on the rebel-held Red Sea port city of Hudaydah. The coalition denied that it had carried out air strikes in the area, and blamed the deaths on rebel mortar fire. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. Almost 10,000 people - two-thirds of them civilians - have been killed and 55,000 others injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition has also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected a million people.

"Shares in Card Factory have fallen 10% after it said weak consumer spending and ""extreme"" weather had caused a fall in sales and would mean lower profits. The greeting cards company has struggled over the past year, and its shares have fallen by a third. It now expects underlying earnings to be between Â£89m and Â£91m this year, below analysts' expectations of Â£93.5m. Despite this, Card Factory is expanding its 900-strong store network and plans to open 50 outlets this year. Card Factory said,externallike-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - had fallen 0.2% in the first half of its financial year, compared with a 3.1% rise a year ago. Chief executive Karen Hubbard said: ""We continue to experience a weak consumer environment, made all the more challenging by the impact of this year's extreme weather conditions on high street footfall. ""Our key fourth quarter trading period will of course be critical in determining the final result for the year, but we believe we are well positioned to deliver a good performance in our important Christmas trading season. ""The performance our seasonal ranges has been strong, with our best ever Father's Day in terms of volume and value, although we recognise there has to be more focus on our everyday ranges, which have lagged the seasonal performance,"" she added. Card Factory's shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250 index, and were down 21.6p at 189.3p by early afternoon. For the first six months of its financial year, to the end of July 2018, Card Factory said total sales were up 3.2%. But within its store network, like-for-like sales were down 0.7%, although there had been a ""marginal improvement"" in the second quarter. Analysts at Liberum said: ""While the overall [like-for-like sales] performance for the [first half] is clearly disappointing, we note that in the wider context of the retail environment and reporting, this could have been worse"". In June, calculations by accountants EY showedthere were 20 profit warnings by retailers in the first half of 2018, double the number issued a year earlier.

"The Hollywood couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014 US actor Brad Pitt has rebutted claims made by his estranged wife Angelina Jolie that he has failed to support their children. In a court filing on Wednesday, the star's legal team said he had paid more than $1.3m (Â£1m) in costs and loaned $8m to Jolie to help her buy a house. On Tuesday, Jolie's lawyer said Pitt had paid ""no meaningful child support"" since she filed for divorce in 2016. The couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014. In the documents, Pitt's lawyers also said Jolie's claims regarding child support were a ""thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage"". Angelina Jolie 'not enjoying being single' Brad Pitt reveals therapy after divorce How Brad Pitt fixed his image problem Her lawyer said in the filing on Tuesday: ""[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [he] has paid no meaningful child support since separation. ""Given that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained... for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file... for the establishment of a retroactive child support order,"" the documents stated. Responding to Pitt's rebuttal, Jolie's lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean said she hoped the dispute could be resolved ""without further delay or posturing"". ""A loan is not... child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate,"" she said. ""Angelina is asking Brad to pay 50% of the children's expenses. He has not. ""Angelina has had to shoulder the majority of those without his contribution for the past two years. Child support is not optional in California."" Jolie cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when she filed to end the marriage, and the pair became embroiled in a bitter child custody battle in the months following the announcement. Pitt was investigated for possible child abuseafter losing his temper in front of some of the children, but was later cleared of the allegations. The couple were known as ""Brangelina"" by fans and met on the set of the 2005 film Mr and Mrs Smith. The marriage was Pitt's second, having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.

"The heatwave is being blamed for record numbers of people going to A&E in England in July. As temperatures soared, attendances reached more than 2.1 million - the highest since records began in 2010. The number of patients waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery also rose to their highest point in more than six years, at 3,517. This is despite a pledge in 2014 by the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to end the ""unacceptable"" waits. The figures are part of a raft of data released on Thursday by NHS England. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Health bodies said the heatwave had added to existing pressures on the NHS, with reports of more people turning up with dehydration, heart failure and kidney problems related to the unusually high temperatures. Prof John Appleby, chief economist of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""July 2018 was the most pressured summer month for A&E departments in recent history, showing that there's no doubt this summer's heatwave has caused severe strain on the NHS."" A&E attendances reached 2,176,022 in July - up from 2,091,318 in June - although attendances have steadily climbed since 2010. The NHS England data also shows,externalthere were 530,000 emergency admissions to A&E, a figure only surpassed once - in May this year - since 2010. The number of patients waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks for routine surgery in June was also at the highest level in a decade, at more than 500,000. The NHS is meant to see 90% of patients who need such operations within 18 weeks, but only 87.8% of patients were seen in that time. The Society for Acute Medicine said the summer was usually a time for frontline staff to ""recharge the batteries"" but that had not happened this year. Dr Nick Scriven, the society's president, said: ""Last year NHS leaders admitted it took until October to recover from winter 2017 and we are now only a few months away from the next onslaught... ""On the plus side, this may have triggered alarm bells earlier than normal and lead to some positive actions being put in place to help us contend with the inevitable winter pressures we will face."" The Royal College of Nursing said the heatwave had placed winter-like strains on the health service. Donna Kinnair, director of nursing policy and practice at the RCN, said nurses were seeing more cases of heart failure, renal failure and dehydration, with older people being particularly at risk. An NHS England spokesman added that there had been an ""unprecedented summer surge"" in July. ""Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in 10 people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours,"" the spokesman said. Separately,a survey,externalof 760,000 people across England on their views of their GP practices showed nearly 40% of patients were unable to get an appointment at the time they wanted. It also found that just 66% of patients who wanted a same-day appointment said they managed to get one. However, nearly 84% described their overall experience of their surgery as very or fairly good. And 68.6% rated their overall experience of making an appointment as good. About a third (35.6%) of patients who wanted to see a GP but found their practice was closed said they ended up going to A&E. The survey of patients in England has been redesigned and now includes 16 to 17-year-olds for the first time, so results cannot be compared to previous years, NHS England said. NHS England also released data on waiting times for young people being treated for eating disorders. In 2016 it introduced waiting time targets to ensure fast treatment for under-19s with eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia. NHS England's figures showed that the proportion of routine cases being seen within the four-week target has risen from 79.9% to 81.2% on the previous quarter. That means 1,243 children and young people out of a total of 1,530 were seen within the target. But the number of urgent cases seen within the target of one week fell from 78.9% to 74.7% - equivalent to 219 young people out of a total of 293. Andrew Radford, chief executive of Beat, the eating disorder charity, said there was still a postcode lottery on how long children and young people were waiting for treatment. An NHS England spokesman said there had been a significant improvement in treatment times for NHS care. ""An extra Â£30m is going into children's eating disorder services every year, with 70 new and improved treatment centres set up in 2017, covering the whole of the country to ensure more young people get the right care, at the time, closer to home,"" he said. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble The history of the NHS in charts Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war Visa row fuels anxiety for Indians eyeing American dream 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Parts of the city of Salisbury were sealed off after the nerve agent attack The US has said it will impose fresh sanctions on Russia after determining it used nerve agent against a former Russian double agent living in the UK. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left seriously ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury in March, though they have now recovered. A UK investigation blamed Russia for the attack, but the Kremlin has strongly denied any involvement. Russia has criticised the new sanctions as ""draconian"". In a statement released on Wednesday, the US State Department confirmed it was implementing measures against Russia over the incident. Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it had been determined that the country ""has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law, or has used lethal chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals"". What happened to the Skripals? Who is Sergei Skripal? What are nerve agents and what do they do?. The British government has welcomed the move. ""The strong international response to the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury sends an unequivocal message to Russia that its provocative, reckless behaviour will not go unchallenged,"" a UK Foreign Office statement said. The Russian embassy in the US hit back on Thursday morning, criticising what it called ""far-fetched accusations"" from the US that Russia was behind the attack. Russia had become ""accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence"", it said, adding: ""We continue to strongly stand for an open and transparent investigation of the crime committed in Salisbury."" The new sanctions will take effect on or around 22 August, and relate to the exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies. The State Department said ""more draconian"" sanctions will follow within 90 days if Russia fails to give reliable assurances it will no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury An official said it was only the third time that the US had determined a country had used chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals. Previous occasions were against Syria and against North Korea for the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of leader Kim Jong-un, who died when highly toxic VX nerve agent was rubbed on his face at Kuala Lumpur airport. No. In June the US imposed sanctions on five Russian companies and three Russian individuals in response to alleged Russian cyber-attacks on the US. All are prohibited from any transactions involving the US financial system. Will Russian suspects face UK trial? Poisoning area gets economy funding Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the measures were to counter ""malicious actors"" working to ""increase Russia's offensive cyber-capabilities"". Analysis by Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington After pressure from Republican members of Congress, the State Department has determined Moscow broke international law by using a military grade chemical weapon on the Skripals. While the US expelled some five dozen diplomats shortly after the poisoning, the administration stopped short of making a formal determination that Russia had broken international law. But Congress has been pushing for such a decision and now the state department has confirmed Russia's actions contravened 1991 US legislation on the use of chemical weapons.  That breach automatically triggers the imposition of sanctions and places requirements on Russia to avert further restrictions in three months' time. Those requirements could include opening up sites in Russia for inspection - a move Moscow would probably resist. So far President Donald Trump has been silent on this latest move - which could well derail his attempts to develop a new, warmer relationship with Vladimir Putin. Following the incident, the British government said the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, of a type developed by Russia, had been used in the attack. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Relations between Russia and the West hit a new low. More than 20 countries expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, including the US. Washington ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. Three months after the Salisbury attack, two other people fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from the city.Dawn Sturgess later died while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital. After tests, scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had also been exposed to Novichok. Mr Rowleytold ITV News,externalhe had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and given it to Ms Sturgess, who sprayed the substance on her wrists. What happened to the Skripals?

"A fireball exploding during an Israeli air strike Three Palestinians have reportedly been killed in Gaza, as Israel carried out dozens of air strikes in response to a barrage of rocket fire by militants. Gaza health officials said a pregnant woman and her daughter, aged one, were killed in the Jaafari area. A Hamas militant also died in the north. At least seven civilians were injured by rocket fire in southern Israel. The violence came as the UN and Egypt tried to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which dominates Gaza. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said he was ""deeply alarmed"",external. ""Our collective efforts have prevented the situation from exploding until now. If the current escalation, however, is not contained immediately, the situation can rapidly deteriorate with devastating consequences for all people,"" he warned. This is the third serious flare-up in violence in the past month. On Monday, two militants were killed after an Israeli tank shelled a Hamas border post in northern Gaza. The Hamas rockets were pictured as streaks of light in photographs taken in Sderot The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the tank had responded to shots fired at soldiers from the post. But Hamas said its fighters had been taking part in a live-fire exercise and that Israel would pay for their deaths. On Wednesday afternoon, the IDF said militants had fired shots at civilians constructing an underground barrier,externalalong the border fence, damaging a vehicle. In response, a tank targeted a Hamas post in northern Gaza, it added. After sunset, militants in Gaza launched rockets and mortars at Sderot and other towns in southern Israel, triggering sirens and sending civilians running for shelters. The IDF said that approximately 180 projectiles were fired towards Israeli territory in total overnight. The Iron Dome aerial defence system intercepted more than 30 of them, while most of the others landed in open fields, causing no damage, it added.

A man was also lightly injured. Five Israeli civilians were reportedly wounded elsewhere, while dozens were treated for shock.

The Israeli military said it had hit ""military and strategic targets"" in Gaza Gaza's health ministry said pregnant 23-year-old Inas Khammash and her 18-month daughter Bayan were killed in one of the air strikes. Her husband was reportedly injured. At least 12 other people were injured in other strikes, two of them critically, according to the ministry. The IDF said its air strikes had represented a ""significant blow to Hamas"" and warned the group that it would ""bear the consequences for its terrorist activities against the citizens of Israel"". Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri tweeted that Israel bore ""full responsibility for the current round of escalation"", and called on the international community to ""shoulder its responsibilities towards Israel's aggression and siege"". Who are Hamas? Life in the Gaza strip A Palestinian official at a joint command centre for militant factions in Gaza told Reuters news agency that they had been ""responding to crimes"" by Israel - an apparent reference to the incident on Monday. But he added that this round of fighting was now ""over as far as we are concerned"". The calm only lasted a few hours, however, before a long-range Grad rocket landed in an open area on the outskirts of the southern Israeli city of Beersheba - setting off sirens there for the first time since the last Gaza war in 2014. Shortly afterwards, an Israeli air strike hit a multi-storey cultural building in Gaza City,reducing it to rubble,externaland injuring 18 people, Gaza health officials said. There was no immediate confirmation from the IDF, but Israeli media said the building was believed to have served as a Hamas headquarters. There has been an upsurge in violence since the end of March. More than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces - most during protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel.

"(Left to right) Robin Stewart from the Reach Project, Michael Stone, Karen Stone, DUP East Belfast Councillor George Dorrian, former DUP MLA Sammy Douglas The brother of a man murdered by a multiple killer said he should have been informed that he is on temporary release. Loyalist Michael Stone was convicted of murdering Roddy Hackett's brother Dermot in 1987. Stone opened a sale of his artwork in east Belfast in July while on overnight leave from Maghaberry Prison. He was convicted of killing six people during the Troubles and is coming to the end of a 30-year sentence. According to the Northern Ireland Prison Service, victims have to register with a special scheme before they receive information about a prisoner's release date or any periods of temporary release. A pair of paintings by loyalist Michael Stone In July, Stone opened an exhibition of 24 of his paintings while out on an unsupervised temporary release day at the Reach Project on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast. Money was raised at the exhibition for Muscular Dystrophy UK but the charity has said it will not accept donations from the event. ""We were not aware that Mr Stone had work on show at the Milestones exhibition,"" a spokesperson for Muscular Dystrophy UK said. ""We understand the sensitivities in Northern Ireland about an exhibition including his paintings. After careful consideration, we will be declining the money raised at the event."" Also present at the launch of his art sale were the Grand Secretary of the Orange Order Mervyn Gibson, former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Sammy Douglas and east Belfast DUP councillor George Dorrian. Mr Gibson told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme he attended the event in his role as a ""local minister and also a community activist who has been involved in peace building for many years"". He said that he supported an Orange Order decision not to meet with Sinn FÃ©in but added there was ""no inconsistency in me, as an individual, going to such an exhibition"". ""Over the years I have met many senior Sinn FÃ©in officials who were terrorists, and I do so in the interests of progress and building peace."" This video can not be played The art of a killer - Michael Stone opens art show during jail release A DUP spokesperson said: ""Councillor Dorrian, like all DUP representatives, condemns all acts of terrorism, including the evil deeds committed by Michael Stone."" As a long-term prisoner, Stone is entitled to one 24-hour temporary release day every four weeks in the run up to his final release. As well as killing three mourners during a gun and grenade attack in Milltown Cemetery in 1988, Stone was convicted of murdering three other Catholics in separate gun attacks, including County Tyrone bread server Dermot Hackett who was found dead in his van between Drumquin and Omagh in 1987. Dermot Hackett was 37 when he was murdered ""We should have been notified,"" his brother Roddy said. ""I would hate to think that some of my immediate family happened to walk up the street in Belfast and see him walking towards them. ""I think it would be an awful shock for them, especially Dermot's family. ""It is only right that they should have let us know,"" he added. Stone opened his exhibition on 9 July and it remained open to the public for two days. Some of the 24 paintings in the display seemed to explore loyalist themes Called Milestones 2018, the programme said it was an exhibition of works by ""east Belfast artists Michael and Karen Stone"". Michael Stone married Karen Stone in a ceremony in Maghaberry Prison two years ago. It is understood some of his paintings were sold, with a sign at the launch saying: ""All small paintings Â£150.00."" The exhibition venue was inside the Reach Project, which was set up by ex-members ofthe loyalist Red Hand Commando paramilitary group. Its mission statement said it aims to help ""move people forward into a more peaceful and equitable society"". Reach chairman Jim Wilson described Michael Stone's paintings as ""very special and very interesting to our people and the people of east Belfast in general"". ""Michael Stone is like any other human being,"" he said. ""He has had a past. He is now hoping to have a different future. ""I think it was [David] Trimble who said, if you have a past it does not mean that you can't have a future. If this man is moving into a new phase in his life, he should be allowed to do so. ""For a guy who has been involved in what he has been involved in, I think he is transforming very well. ""That is the transformation we would like to see from all who are ex-combatants."" Asked if he accepted that some may consider Michael Stone's work as offensive, Mr Wilson said:  ""I understand the hurt and pain Michael may have foisted on other families, but it happened on our side as well. ""It was not just Michael Stone who did things wrong in the past. ""People who are administering this government did things wrong in the past."" On 16 March 1988, Michael Stone murdered three mourners during a solo gun and grenade attack on republican funerals at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast. Thomas McErlean, John Murray and Kevin Brady were killed and dozens more were wounded. Three-and-a-half years previously, in November 1984, he murdered milkman Patrick Brady in south Belfast. The following year he shot Kevin McPolin in Lisburn, County Antrim, before killing Dermot Hackett in 1987. Stone also confessed to a series of plots to kill, including a failed bid to assassinate Sinn FÃ©in leader Martin McGuinness. A selection of paintings by Michael Stone He was given a 30-year jail sentence for the six murders, but was freed on licence for a six-year period under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which gave early release to many paramilitary prisoners. Stone was returned to jail after a botched attack at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in November 2006 when armed with explosives, knives and an axe he tried to get inside and kill Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams. He later denied trying to kill the Sinn FÃ©in politicians andsaid it was simply ""an act of performance art"".,external In 2013, Lord Chief justice Sir Declan Morgan ruled that Stone would have to serve a minimum of 30 years in jail for the Milltown killings. This decision meant that Stone could not be considered for release until 2018. It is believed he was turned down for being given a specific release date earlier this year but is currently on a temporary release scheme where he is allowed to leave the prison unaccompanied overnight as part of his pre-release programme. The Department of Justice said a Prisoner Release Victim Information Scheme is in existence. A spokesperson said: ""It is a scheme which provides for victims of crime or where the victim is deceased, the family of the victim, to register to receive information about a prisoner's sentence, about any periods of temporary release from prison for which a prisoner is being considered and about their release from prison at the end of their period in custody. ""The scheme also provides for the written submission to the Prison Service of any concerns victim's (or) victim's family's have about a prisoner's release.""

"Rents could rise 15% by 2023 as the supply of new rental properties dries up, according to a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). It said small scale landlords are pulling out of the market. It blamed tax changes brought in last year which have made buy-to-let investments less profitable. RICS said it was time that the government looked again at the way the private rented sector was regulated. It said its members have seen the supply of new rental property falling consistently for two years. Meanwhile, the majority of its members are seeing steady increases in the number of people looking to rent, although the numbers are levelling off. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: ""The risk... is that a reduced pipeline of supply will gradually feed through into higher rents."" A Treasury spokesperson said the reasoning behind the tax changes was to make more houses available to homebuyers. ""We want to realise the dream of home ownership for a new generation, and that's why we introduced a cut to stamp duty for first time buyers, and have built 1.1m additional homes since 2010,"" the spokesperson said. But Labour's shadow housing secretary said the government was responsible for ""eight years of failure"". John Healey said: ""It's staggering that Conservative ministers still have no answer to the increasing pressures private renters face. ""Labour in government will fix this broken market with bold new rights for renters including an end to no fault evictions and controls on rents."" Changes to the buy-to-let tax regime brought in last year mean that mortgage tax relief for landlords will be restricted to the basic rate of income tax by 2020. RICS said the full impact of the changes and increases in stamp duty have yet to be felt. Abdul Choudhury, RICS policy manager, said: ""Withdrawing tax breaks that small landlords relied on, placing an extra 3% on second home stamp duty, and failing to stimulate the corporate build-to-rent market, has understandably [had an impact on] supply. ""[The] government must urgently look again at the private rented sector as a whole, including ways to encourage good landlords. ""Ultimately, [the] government must consider the impact of its policies, and if the wish is to move away from the private rented sector, it must provide a suitable alternative."" RICS said its survey suggested that East Anglia and the South West of England were likely to see the sharpest growth in rents from now until 2023. James Farrance, director of residential lettings at Braxton estate agents in Maidenhead, said: ""Stock levels [are] declining as some landlords are reducing their holdings due to [the] tax and cost burden from the government increasing. [Buy-to-let] investors are also thin on the ground, put-off by the crippling levels of stamp duty."" Simon Cooper, managing partner of the Exeter office of Stags estate agents, said: ""[There is] incredibly strong tenant demand and a definite lack of instructions to satisfy demand. I can see rents increasing as a result."" Edinburgh property is enjoying a ""mini-boom"" RICS reported little change in house prices, with just a small majority of its members saying that they were rising. Many of those were in the northern regions of England and in Scotland. Most of its members in London reported lower prices. John Brown, group managing director at chartered surveyors John Brown and Company in Edinburgh, said: ""Edinburgh and East of Scotland is experiencing a mini boom [for properties] below Â£500,000. ""The market is very positive, explained by lack of stock and continued interest in the city from other areas. [The] top end is very short of good quality homes.""

"A fireball exploding during an Israeli air strike Three Palestinians have reportedly been killed in Gaza, as Israel carried out dozens of air strikes in response to a barrage of rocket fire by militants. Gaza health officials said a pregnant woman and her daughter, aged one, were killed in the Jaafari area. A Hamas militant also died in the north. At least seven civilians were injured by rocket fire in southern Israel. The violence came as the UN and Egypt tried to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which dominates Gaza. UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said he was ""deeply alarmed"",external. ""Our collective efforts have prevented the situation from exploding until now. If the current escalation, however, is not contained immediately, the situation can rapidly deteriorate with devastating consequences for all people,"" he warned. This is the third serious flare-up in violence in the past month. On Monday, two militants were killed after an Israeli tank shelled a Hamas border post in northern Gaza. The Hamas rockets were pictured as streaks of light in photographs taken in Sderot The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the tank had responded to shots fired at soldiers from the post. But Hamas said its fighters had been taking part in a live-fire exercise and that Israel would pay for their deaths. On Wednesday afternoon, the IDF said militants had fired shots at civilians constructing an underground barrier,externalalong the border fence, damaging a vehicle. In response, a tank targeted a Hamas post in northern Gaza, it added. After sunset, militants in Gaza launched rockets and mortars at Sderot and other towns in southern Israel, triggering sirens and sending civilians running for shelters. The IDF said that approximately 180 projectiles were fired towards Israeli territory in total overnight. The Iron Dome aerial defence system intercepted more than 30 of them, while most of the others landed in open fields, causing no damage, it added. But some hit houses, cars, factories and a playground. Cars, homes and factories were damaged by rockets and mortars that hit Israeli towns A Thai woman was seriously injured when a rocket hit her home in the Eshkol Region Council, the Times of Israel said,external. A man was also lightly injured. Five Israeli civilians were reportedly wounded elsewhere, while dozens were treated for shock. The IDF said it responded by carrying out air strikes on more than 150 ""military and strategic targets"" in Gaza, including Hamas compounds, training camps, a weapons storage facility, a naval complex, a building site being used to make weapons and tunnel components, and two tunnels along the Gaza coast. The Israeli military said it had hit ""military and strategic targets"" in Gaza Gaza's health ministry said pregnant 23-year-old Inas Khammash and her 18-month daughter Bayan were killed in one of the air strikes. Her husband was reportedly injured. At least 12 other people were injured in other strikes, two of them critically, according to the ministry. The IDF said its air strikes had represented a ""significant blow to Hamas"" and warned the group that it would ""bear the consequences for its terrorist activities against the citizens of Israel"". Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri tweeted that Israel bore ""full responsibility for the current round of escalation"", and called on the international community to ""shoulder its responsibilities towards Israel's aggression and siege"". Who are Hamas? Life in the Gaza strip A Palestinian official at a joint command centre for militant factions in Gaza told Reuters news agency that they had been ""responding to crimes"" by Israel - an apparent reference to the incident on Monday. But he added that this round of fighting was now ""over as far as we are concerned"". The calm only lasted a few hours, however, before a long-range Grad rocket landed in an open area on the outskirts of the southern Israeli city of Beersheba - setting off sirens there for the first time since the last Gaza war in 2014. Shortly afterwards, an Israeli air strike hit a multi-storey cultural building in Gaza City,reducing it to rubble,externaland injuring 18 people, Gaza health officials said. There was no immediate confirmation from the IDF, but Israeli media said the building was believed to have served as a Hamas headquarters. There has been an upsurge in violence since the end of March. More than 160 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces - most during protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force at the protests, but the military said they only opened fire in self-defence or on people trying to infiltrate its territory. One Israeli soldier has been shot dead by a Palestinian sniper during the same period, while incendiary devices attached to balloons and kites launched by Palestinians have sparked hundreds of fires in southern Israel.

"The New York Taxi Workers Alliance has described it as a ""historic victory"" New York has become the first major US city to approve a cap on ride-hail car licences and set minimum pay conditions for drivers. The bill will impact popular app-based services like Uber and Lyft, who have both spoken out against it. Yellow cab drivers and anti-congestion campaigners have pushed for regulation after the number of app-based cars soared in recent years. About 80,000 now operate throughout the city, versus just 13,500 yellow cabs. Taxi drivers demonstrated in support of the bill outside the headquarters of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) this week, holding signs with the names and faces of six taxi drivers who had taken their lives since December. Campaign and union groups directly linked the financial pressures caused by the growth of ride-hail car services to the driver suicides. The number of app-based cars in New York now dwarf traditional Yellow cabs The bill passed on Wednesday approves a year-long moratorium on new ride-hail vehicle licences for 12 months, with the exception of wheelchair accessible cars. It also gives the TLC the power to regulate minimum rates of fares, minimum pay for drivers and create a new rulebook for app companies. The legislation was supported by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said it would help ""stop the influx of cars"" causing congestion in the city. However, ride-hail services have criticised the bill and argued it will hurt consumers. Uber said in a statement: ""The city's 12-month pause on new vehicle licenses will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion."" Uber ruled as a cab firm in Europe Uber applies for drunk passenger patent Lyft said the move would ""bring New Yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of colour and in the outer boroughs."" New York is the biggest US market for app Uber. A study last month estimated that app-based drivers now complete over 17 million trips a month in New York,external. The study, commissioned for the TLC, recommended a minimum hourly wage for drivers of $17.22 per hour - and found that 85% of app-based drivers currently net below that amount. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance celebrated the vote, describing it on its website as a historic victory for its 18,000-member strong union.
