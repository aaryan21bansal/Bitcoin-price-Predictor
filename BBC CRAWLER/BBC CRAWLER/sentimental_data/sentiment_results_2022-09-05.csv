"Prime Minister Liz Truss is understood to be planning to borrow billions to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500 with full details expected on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. The government's plans to subsidise bills means that customers will not be expected to repay the support. It is unclear how long the government support will last, but the overall government support package is expected to total around Â£100bn. The  ultimate figure will depend on gas and energy price movements in the highly volatile international energy markets as well as how much additional support is offered to the most vulnerable. Ms Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with details expected to be announced on Thursday. Energy bosses have insisted for some time that a government-backed superfund from which they could borrow to subsidise bills ""is the only game in town"". However, the government is understood to be reluctant to see money added to customer bills for up to 20 years so energy companies could pay back the loans. It is also thought to be reluctant to add the cost to general taxation, given their pledges to be a tax cutting government. What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? New PM Liz Truss expected to freeze energy bills Warning firms will close this winter without help What cost-of-living payments will I get? Kwasi Kwarteng - tipped to be the new chancellor - has already indicated the government is prepared to borrow to support the economy. This would be consistent with Ms Truss' position that the UK needs to break free of the Treasury's strict spending rules. Nevertheless, the estimated Â£100bn is a sizeable sum to borrow at the same time as cutting taxes and boosting spending on defence and it could end up costing more than that, given the fluctuating price of wholesale gas. ""One of the dangers here is that it could even be more expensive than Â£100bn,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, contrasting it with the Covid-prompted furlough scheme, which cost Â£60bn-Â£70bn. ""There has to be a risk that energy prices stay high for a long time, perhaps even up to three or four years,"" he said. ""Then this starts being baked into public spending long-term."" The cost of UK government borrowing hit its highest level for eight years on Tuesday, with the yield on ten-year bonds rising above 3%. That reflects the market's expectation that the government will have to borrow more and means any future borrowing will be more expensive. Mr Johnson said the plan to borrow to support energy bills was only one you would adopt ""if you can't think of anything else"" because it amounted to subsidising everybody's gas use, when the higher price suggested there was not enough gas available. That could lead to rationing, he suggested, and would mean high-income households would benefit by a much larger amount than those at the lower end. How is the rising cost of living affecting you?

Businesses are also expected to be offered some relief in the plan set to be announced on Thursday. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more. Thousands would go bust or cut their wage bills by firing staff. The precise mechanism to help business may be more complicated and would be reviewed more frequently but reports suggest it could see the government mandate energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy businesses use. Including businesses could easily push the cost of the government's energy plan over Â£100bn. Alex Veitch of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""It is encouraging that the government is seriously considering the support it can give to businesses during these very difficult times. ""But it remains to be seen whether these plans will go far enough in offering the help that many firms so desperately need."" Craig Beaumont from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""This commitment looks very promising, and arguably the best reassurance that small businesses need that some form of help with bills will follow - not just for households. ""The scope and reach of the help is going to be absolutely crucial to save hundreds of thousands of small businesses this winter."" What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills?

"Rishi Sunak will establish a series of firsts when he becomes prime minister - including becoming the first British Asian person to hold the office, and being the first prime minister appointed by King Charles III. But much of the process of the next few days will follow choreography set by decades of tradition. So what happens now and what can he expect when he does formally become prime minister? Liz Truss will hold her final Cabinet meeting at 09:00 BST on Tuesday. As Rishi Sunak is not currently in the Cabinet, he will not be present. Like many a departing prime minister, she will then deliver a final speech outside 10 Downing Street at about 10:15. Ms Truss will then be driven to Buckingham Palace to offer her resignation to the King. This means Ms Truss will miss out on her chance of a goodbye in the House of Commons, as she announced her departure after last week's Prime Minister's Questions, but is being replaced before this week's takes place at noon on Wednesday. In the past that has provided an opportunity for a standing ovation or a tearful farewell from supporters. Last monthit gave Boris Johnson the chanceto tell the Commons ""Hasta la vista, baby"". Once Ms Truss has departed the scene - and the UK is temporarily without a prime minister - Mr Sunak, as leader of the largest party in the Commons, will be invited to Buckingham Palace by the King. The King will ask Mr Sunak if he believes he can form a new government, before the politician is  appointed through a tradition called ""kissing hands"". In his autobiography, Tony Blair - who was operating on only one hour's sleep following his election victory - admitted to being a bit confused when a royal official told him: ""You don't actually kiss the Queen's hands in the ceremony of kissing hands. You brush them gently with your lips."" David Cameron gave his first speech as prime minister in dying light Having been formally appointed as prime minister, the new leader will head to 10 Downing Street - his new workplace and (usually) his new home - although in the past, Tony Blair swapped with the living quarters above No 11 to accommodate his family more comfortably. Here, at about 11:35, Mr Sunak will make his first prime ministerial speech with the aim of explaining what he wants to do in government. Margaret Thatcher promised to bring ""harmony... where there is discord"", Gordon Brown vowed to ""try his utmost"", Theresa May spoke of tackling ""burning injustices"" in society, while Boris Johnson warned that ""the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters"" would ""lose their shirts"". The plans are for the speech to be outside No 10 - but becoming prime minister in October means there is a persistent risk of rain, so Mr Sunak's team might be anxiouslychecking the weather. Downing Street staff greet a new boss with applause, but they will have just bid farewell to a predecessor The new prime minister will then enter through the famous black door to be greeted by Downing Street staff, who traditionally line up to applaud their new boss. Usually it is all smiles, but not always. When he arrived, Mr Blair noticed one of the secretaries was in tears. Lord Robin Butler - the most senior civil servant at the time - recalls that Mr Blair asked if she was OK. ""Well, Mr Blair, you are welcome,"" she replied ""but I did so like that nice Mr Major [Mr Blair's predecessor]."" There is not much time for anxious introspection as a prime minister must immediately begin appointing senior ministers, some of whom can prove to be surprisingly elusive, just at the moment the party leader wants to sound them out about accepting a promotion. Dealing with angry or even eager colleagues is to be expected for a prime minister on their first day. Mr Sunak has yet to set out how he plans to bring together a party riven into factions that have driven out two prime ministers in three months. Tony Blair made it into Downing Street - but his team struggled to get pizza in Civil servants -  government workers who are not politically appointed so do not change with a new prime minister - will have been monitoring the candidates' various policy pronouncements throughout the leadership campaign and preparing advice. Mr Sunak has not publicly updated his policy platform since the summer, when he last ran for leader. Since then the economic picture has changed. Government borrowing costs have increased following weeks of market turmoil set off by Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. On his first day in the job, Mr Sunak will be presented with briefs from civil servants setting out how his policy plans can be put into action. ""It is a very big pile of paper,"" says Lord Robin Butler, who led the civil service under Ms Thatcher, John Major and Mr Blair. ""You want them [the new prime minister] to feel that everything has been thought of."" At some point during his first few days, the prime minister will have to do something that will put everything else into perspective. He will sit down and write letters to the four commanders of the UK Trident submarines with instructions about whether he should retaliate in the event the UK suffers a nuclear attack. The letters are stored in a safe on board the submarines, and only opened if contact with the UK is lost. James Callaghan - prime minister from 1976-1979 - is the only former leader to reveal what he would have done in the event of a nuclear attack. ""If we had got to that point where it was, I felt, necessary to do it - then I would have done it,"" he told a BBC documentary in 1988. ""I've had terrible doubts of course about this. And I say to you that if I had lived after having pressed that button, I would never, never have forgiven myself."" In 2013, political historianLord Peter Hennessy told BBC Radio Four:""This is the moment they know what being prime minister is all about - no other job can prepare you for this."" The first days of the prime minister's term are normally filled with phone calls from foreign dignitaries. President Biden is looking forward to speaking with Mr Sunak in the coming days, the White House Press Secretary said. But they added that it was ""protocol for the president to wait until after an incoming British prime minister has met with the monarch and been invited to form a new government to offer his congratulations"". The congratulations have already started rolling in, though. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted ""Special Diwali wishes"" to Mr Sunak and ""the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership"".

"Liz Truss on a visit to Brussels in March It's polite, of course, to congratulate the new leader of a neighbour and ally. But the tone of EU leaders' messages to Liz Truss - seen here in Brussels as a hardliner on Brexit, and a hawk when it comes to Russia - reveals a lot more than a superficial ""well done"". Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission chief, tweeted that the UK and EU were partners, facing current challenges together - but that she hoped as prime minister, Liz Truss would be ""constructive"", respecting agreements previously reached between the two sides. MEP Nathalie Loiseau, France's former Europe minister, was more direct, tweeting: ""I hope she will refrain from making things more difficult between the EU and the UK."" Politicians in Eastern Europe, meanwhile, who openly applaud the UK for its tough stance towards the Kremlin, were unreservedly warm. Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted a photo of her alongside Liz Truss during her time as British foreign secretary, saying: ""I'm confident our partnership will only grow."" But does Liz Truss actually need to worry about what EU leaders think of her? The answer is very much yes. EU relations are a pressing issue for the incoming prime minister. The reason: despite the political separation of Brexit, pressing events in the rest of Europe can have, and are having, a considerable real-time impact back in the UK. When countries with a big economy like Germany, in its current hurried attempt to find alternatives to Russian energy, bids aggressively for Norwegian gas - a source the UK already relies on - that affects prices, and potentially even UK access to supplies. The EU as a whole is now trying to find a common means of stabilising energy prices across the bloc. Analysts predict that will have quite an impact on the energy market - at least if EU countries, with their contrasting priorities, ever manage to reach an agreement. Then there's migration. As foreign secretary, Liz Truss promised to be ""robust"" with the French authorities to stop the rising number of refugees and other migrants trying to reach the UK across the English Channel. But being too assertive, or combative vis-Ã -vis Paris, is unlikely to guarantee that French co-operation needed from Calais. Relations weren't helped this summer when Liz Truss retorted that the ""jury was out"" on French President Emmanuel Macron, after she was asked if he was a friend or a foe to the UK. Liz Truss: From teenage Lib Dem to Tory PM Truss vows to deal with energy crisis as next PM How Liz Truss won the Tory leadership contest France's Europe Minister Laurence Boone recently commented that the next UK prime minister would need to be judged by their actions in office, rather than their words on the campaign trail. But - off the record - European politicians view Ms Truss's words as a political gaffe, ""ill-befitting the future leader of one of the world's most powerful nations"", as a senior EU figure said to me. ""Here in Europe, the jury is out on Liz Truss,"" he added. Conflict over the post-Brexit agreement with the EU on Northern Ireland is another likely flashpoint for the UK's incoming prime minister, with potentially huge and immediate consequences. The issue is complex, but the impact can be summed up in three simple words. Looming. Trade. War. Essentially, 10 days from now, we could see the introduction of costly trade barriers, imposed by the EU on the UK. Something Liz Truss's rival Rishi Sunak warned loudly against, because of the huge pressure the UK economy is already under. On 15 September, all eyes in Brussels will be firmly fixed on Liz Truss. That's the day by which the UK is legally obliged to respond to infringement proceedings launched by the EU - alleging that the UK has failed to honour its commitments under the Brexit treaty on Northern Ireland signed by Boris Johnson and the EU - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. If Liz Truss turns up the heat much further, the EU says it will respond first with targeted sanctions against the UK, eventually looking at suspending the entire post-Brexit trade deal, if no negotiated agreement can be found. So, how might the UK's brand-new prime minister respond? She could attempt to dial down the temperature with Brussels. But many EU figures I've spoken to are cynical. Take this blunt comment from a high-level diplomat from one of the EU's most influential countries: ""Ms Truss has shown she's keen to play to the political gallery at home. She cleverly utilised opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol and to the EU itself in the Eurosceptic right of her [Conservative] party, to garner support to become leader. ""Of course, as you say in English, the proof will be in the pudding once she settles into 10 Downing Street. But we Europeans are pragmatists, not political fantasists. Brexit was politicised from the start. That's unlikely to stop with Liz Truss."" The concern in Brussels is that within days of becoming UK prime minister, Liz Truss could choose to temporarily suspend parts of the protocol by triggering Article 16 of the Treaty. That article may be triggered if either side believes the protocol is provoking ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"" in Northern Ireland or diversion of trade. Liz Truss and the Johnson government she served have long said there were fundamental problems with the protocol, adversely affecting politics and society in Northern Ireland. They often threatened to trigger Article 16, and this summer they provoked outrage in Brussels and very much in Dublin when they introduced a bill in the UK parliament to override most of the core parts of the protocol unilaterally. That bill is now going to the House of Lords - where it's expected to have a bumpy reception. Many in the EU suspect Ms Truss could be tempted to use Article 16 as a stop gap until the bill becomes law in the UK. Given it is an international treaty agreed by both sides, Brussels says unilateral action to change the protocol is unacceptable. This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government's proposed Northern Ireland Protocol changes are ""within international law"". The EU's chief negotiator, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, said on Friday that the EU would never walk away from the negotiating table. But he accused the UK of ""not engaging in any meaningful way"" with Brussels since February and of dismissing proposals and compromises the EU had offered to address issues with the protocol in Northern Ireland. Ireland's prime minister, Taoiseach MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin, says he'd welcome a meeting with Liz Truss early in her premiership: ""I think relationships are very important and I've always in my political life worked to build relationships with people. And the Irish-British relationship is particularly important."" Liz Truss's team insists she prefers a negotiated outcome with the EU. The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill has been described by UK government figures as ""an insurance policy"". EU leaders say they view it as a loaded gun on the negotiating table. The mood in Brussels and across European capitals is not optimistic. ""Germany is far more impatient with the UK under [Chancellor Olaf] Scholz than with [Angela] Merkel,"" a senior EU diplomat said to me. Berlin is also concerned about Liz Truss and her position on the crisis in Ukraine. To date, European countries and the UK have worked well together over targeted sanctions against Moscow and sending weapons to help the Ukrainian military. But splits have surfaced inside the EU as to how far military support should go and to what extent the aim should be to ""humiliate"" Russia into an unconditional surrender. Liz Truss has been more outspoken publicly than even the Ukrainians, suggesting back in April that Russia should be driven back to its pre-2014 borders. As I mentioned at the start of this blog, EU members Poland and the Baltic States - geographically so close to Russia and feeling threatened by Russian President Vladimir Putin - agree wholeheartedly with Liz Truss's ""teach-Russia-a-lesson sentiment"", as one diplomat put it to me. But big EU powers France, Germany and Italy say they are concerned that a cornered Vladimir Putin could lash out, possibly resorting to nuclear or biological weapons. ""I hope Liz Truss will be mindful and measured,"" a seasoned European figure told me. ""She hopefully won't fan the flames of European allies with extremist positions.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Moment Liz Truss announced as new Tory leader A heavy burden of responsibility falls immediately upon the shoulders of any new prime minister, often causing a silent quiver of nerves. For Liz Truss, self doubt does not form part of her lexicon. People who have met her in recent days say she is relishing the ride and is brimming with self-confidence. But even the UK's new prime minister might admit in private that what she describes as ""eye-watering"" energy bills will present her with a hefty challenge, unprecedented since her hero Margaret Thatcher assumed office nearly half a century ago. When Lady Thatcher moved into Downing Street in 1979, the country had a good idea of their new prime minister. She had been leader of the opposition for four years. While Truss has been a cabinet minister for eight years, she has had a lower profile than Thatcher. And even those who know the foreign secretary are wondering what instincts she will follow. Will we see the return to the fore of the pragmatist who moved seamlessly from the Remain camp to the warm embrace of the Brexiteers? Or will she govern in the mode of her leadership campaign - a lady not for turning, in the words of Thatcher, who will focus on tax cuts? Chris Mason: No honeymoon period for next PM Liz Truss: From teenage Lib Dem to Tory PM Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss Over the past few days, BBC Newsnight has been speaking to people who know Truss to assess whether her past can tell us about her future. The consensus seems to be that we will see Liz Truss turning to both sides of her political past to guide her thinking. Over the weekend Truss announced that within a week of taking office, she will outline an emergency plan to help people with those energy bills. But in a ""fiscal event"" later this month, her new chancellor will outline a ""broader package"" that will hold fast to her campaign pledges. Baroness Morgan of Cotes, who entered parliament with Truss in 2010 and who served with her in cabinet, says we will see the two sides of the new prime minister's character in response to the energy crisis. ""I think that there'll be a combination of approaches,"" Baroness Morgan tells Newsnight. ""I think people are going to find it's quite hard to pigeonhole Liz in many ways."" Paul Goodman, editor of the ConservativeHome website and someone who knew Truss during his time as an MP, says the new PM will need to put the UK on a war footing to both meet the energy crisis and to shore up her political support. ""The key to Liz Truss over many years has been her adaptability,"" he says. ""So although she has this reputation as an ideologue and she has very clear ideological roots - originally as a Liberal Democrat - she is somehow the darling of Leavers who in the referendum was a Remainer. ""She is the champion now of the Tory right, having once been a Liberal Democrat. And she's presented herself in this election as the new kid on the block when she's actually been in cabinet for the best part of 10 years. So she has extraordinary powers of reinvention and recovery."" Liz Truss campaigned for Remain during the EU referendum, but quickly backed Brexit after the vote But there could be political trouble in embracing strong state support to help people with energy bills. ""The difficulty for her would be this: among the people who elected her are a large body of people who want a different approach,"" Goodman says. ""So she would have to fall back for support on the body in the Conservative party that didn't vote for her, while irritating, if not angering, some of those that did. And that's going to be a very difficult political horse to ride."" An unlikely political mentor sees a more ideological figure. Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, the former Labour defence secretary, encouraged Truss to pursue a political career when she was head of government relations at Cable & Wireless, where he served as a board member. ""Liz is somebody who gets on well with people,"" Robertson said. ""She has become much more ideological since the days when I would meet her occasionally in the House of Commonsâ¦ I think she's going to turn out to be quite an ideological fixed-view person in No 10."" Robertson knew her as a conventional budding politician who had attended Oxford and who would soon enter the world of Westminster think tanks. That conventional path was pursued in parliament when Truss followed David Cameron's lead in supporting Remain in the referendum. The careers of many Tory Remainers were destroyed by that referendum. But it was the making of Truss. In the aftermath of the referendum she intuited what would happen at the time when it was a genuinely open question about what sort of Brexit we'd end up with. ""The Leavers will win because they care more,"" she told friends. That was a political judgment which led her to make an emotional commitment - she would throw her lot in with that side, lock stock and barrel. Mr Goodman says her change of tack is more complicated than a simple case of a pivoting politician. ""My memory of the time is of a certain vibe emanating from Liz Truss which is: 'What's all this got to do with me? I'm trying to get on my with my job as [environment secretary] and this referendum seems to me a massive distraction from it.'"" He added: ""So I don't feel it was just about pleasing the powers that be. But what happened then shows her powers of adaptability."" Changing her mind is constant theme for Truss, who was an active Liberal Democrat at university. But her passion for politics, influenced by her left-wing activist parents as a child, has also been constant. Truss's success has led to something of a family split. Her mother Priscilla has put family ties before politics and is enthusiastically supporting her daughter. But her father John, a maths professor, is less reconciled to the idea of his daughter as a Tory prime minister, according to her friends. But Liz Truss does take one core gift from her father into Downing Street: a passion for maths. And anyone invited to an interview with the prime minister had better expect a tricky maths challenge.

"Various arrests have been made in connection with the shooting death of Olivia Pratt-Korbel Police will identify those responsible for the murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel with the help of the local community, an assistant chief constable has said. Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green said already ""the community has stepped forward"". Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother tried to stop a gunman entering their house in Liverpool on 22 August. A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murderin the early hours of Sunday. He remains in custody and police were granted a further 36 hours on Monday night to continue questioning him. The same extension was also granted regarding two men, aged 29 and 41, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. A fourth man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Sunday night is also being questioned. Olivia's death was one of three fatal shootings within a week in the city. Appealing for information, Mr Green said: ""The community's been rocked and shocked by what has happened. Our thoughts and prayers go the families of the three people who have been killed over the last two weeks. ""But the community has stood strong and stepped forward. ""The response we have seen, whether it's providing information or just being resolute in a collective ambition to make sure that those individuals in our communities who are engaged in organised crime - the intimidation, the violence, the use of firearms - they've got no place in our society. ""The community has stepped forward and together we'll identify those responsible."" A tribute was paid to Olivia on the big screen at Goodison Park on Saturday He said dashcam footage, CCTV and other pieces of intelligence had been submitted by members of the public. Mr Green continued to appeal for information but said community support had already allowed officers to ""make investigative decisions and take action"" Police previously arrested two men, aged 33 and 36, on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder beforereleasing them on bail. The child was shot in the chest by a gunman who had chased convicted burglar Joseph Nee into her home on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at about 22:00 BST. Neither of the men who entered the home had any links to her family. Her mother Cheryl Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door on the shooter. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston 30 August, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. Merseyside Police has appealed for the public to come forward with information But she was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. A minute's applausewas held nine minutes into the Everton v Liverpool gameon Saturday. An anti-knife and gun crime banner was unfurled in the Bullens Road stand at the Premier League game stretching across both Everton and Liverpool supporters. Olivia's funeral is due to take place at St Margaret Mary's Church in Dovecot on 15 September and her family has asked mourners to wear a ""splash of pink"" for the service.

"Various arrests have been made in connection with the shooting death of Olivia Pratt-Korbel Police will identify those responsible for the murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel with the help of the local community, an assistant chief constable has said. Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green said already ""the community has stepped forward"". Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother tried to stop a gunman entering their house in Liverpool on 22 August. A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murderin the early hours of Sunday. He remains in custody and police were granted a further 36 hours on Monday night to continue questioning him. The same extension was also granted regarding two men, aged 29 and 41, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. A fourth man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Sunday night is also being questioned. Olivia's death was one of three fatal shootings within a week in the city. Appealing for information, Mr Green said: ""The community's been rocked and shocked by what has happened. Our thoughts and prayers go the families of the three people who have been killed over the last two weeks. ""But the community has stood strong and stepped forward. ""The response we have seen, whether it's providing information or just being resolute in a collective ambition to make sure that those individuals in our communities who are engaged in organised crime - the intimidation, the violence, the use of firearms - they've got no place in our society. ""The community has stepped forward and together we'll identify those responsible."" A tribute was paid to Olivia on the big screen at Goodison Park on Saturday He said dashcam footage, CCTV and other pieces of intelligence had been submitted by members of the public. Mr Green continued to appeal for information but said community support had already allowed officers to ""make investigative decisions and take action"" Police previously arrested two men, aged 33 and 36, on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder beforereleasing them on bail. The child was shot in the chest by a gunman who had chased convicted burglar Joseph Nee into her home on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at about 22:00 BST. Neither of the men who entered the home had any links to her family. Her mother Cheryl Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door on the shooter. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston 30 August, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. Merseyside Police has appealed for the public to come forward with information But she was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. A minute's applausewas held nine minutes into the Everton v Liverpool gameon Saturday. An anti-knife and gun crime banner was unfurled in the Bullens Road stand at the Premier League game stretching across both Everton and Liverpool supporters. Olivia's funeral is due to take place at St Margaret Mary's Church in Dovecot on 15 September and her family has asked mourners to wear a ""splash of pink"" for the service.

"Susan and Paul Clifton would be ""up the creek without a paddle"" without his disability payments ""If I didn't laugh, I'd cry but there's no point - it's not going to get me anywhere."" This is Susan Clifton's verdict on the coming storm that energy prices and cost of living rises are bringing to many people as the winter approaches. The 67-year-old pensioner has all her costs planned out on a spreadsheet that runs through to next spring, and has to hope no unforeseen emergencies arise. Annual energy billsare predicted to rise by 80% to Â£3,549come October. It follows the raising of theenergy price cap,external, in part because of a cut in the supply of gas from Russia to Europe. Costs could reach Â£6,000 for the average household per annum by April. The new Conservative leader has been announced as Liz Truss and she will take office as PM on Tuesday. Thenew PM is expected to be given a series of optionsthis week by Whitehall to help struggling households cope with the soaring energy bills, one of which includes a freeze on energy bills. Mum starts rationing and trader fears for business Rising costs a national emergency, minister says For Susan, from Crynant, Neath Port Talbot, the rising cost of living means rigidly documenting how much her fuel bill will be each week and budgeting for it all the way through to next spring. ""I'm putting Â£75 a week aside [at the moment] for gas and electric,"" she said. ""When it goes up in October, it will be Â£80, and then I've put it up to Â£110 come January. Then Â£105 in April so that will be a bit less, but the heating will go off then."" Susan lives in a two-bedroom housing association bungalow with her husband Paul, who is also 67, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and needs to use a nebuliser four times a day to help his lungs function. This video can not be played Worried about energy bills? The BBC's Colletta Smith tells you - in a minute - about four discounts and payments that could help As the machine is run off the mains, Susan worries about what will happen if there are power cuts this winter. She has also made plans for this eventuality. ""I'm ordering a bottle gas cooker and extra bottles, and candles and solar and rechargeable batteries. If we get a power cut I'm really worried because he relies on his nebuliser four times a day,"" she explained. ""If he didn't get on it four times a day, he starts filling up with fluid and can get pneumonia which he's had twice. In our old place it was very damp. I nearly lost him last time. ""We were waiting four years [to move]. We got offered this while he was in hospital with the second bout of pneumonia."" The improved housing is a big relief but it has not relieved the strain increased costs are now putting on her budget. When she goes shopping, there is no room for impulse buys. ""Literally everything has to be written down. I have never been so anal,"" she said, managing a laugh. But she added: ""I've stocked up on tins in case there's snow and I can't get to the shops as I need to catch public transport. I've got a barbeque in case the power goes. ""The only thing I can't plan for is his nebuliser."" Families turn off power as bills rocket - charity Middle-aged 'face energy price double whammy' Any emergencies will wipe out her small amount of savings, which she has already had to defer spending because of the fear of not being able to cover bills. She said: ""If we didn't get personal independence payments [for Paul's disability] we'd be up the creek without a paddle. It's being used for food and things like that and it's not supposed to be used for that. It's supposed to be for him, for his [disability] needs."" Jean Davies wonders if her small savings will survive rising costs if she lives for another decade or two Jean Davies, 70, is another retiree who tried to plan ahead as much as possible. A former civil servant from Brecon, Powys, she was made redundant at 58. She downsized a few years back and now lives alone in a two-up, two-down house which she spent a good part of her savings making improvements to in order to be as energy efficient as possible. She explained: ""I moved in here and I renewed everything. I had a new roof, new windows, a back and front door. ""I'm as tight and cosy as can be for saving energy. There's nothing more I can do."" Although she is managing at the moment, she worries what the soaring costs could do to her finances if they persist into the future, with talk of annual bills of Â£6,000. ""I have a small pension of under Â£1,000 a month. I'm 70 - I could live to be 80 or 90. The small nest egg I've got is going to be depleted at that rate."" To keep her costs down, she keeps the radiator in the second bedroom turned off. She shops at budget supermarket Aldi, always cooks two meals at once, doing double helpings of potatoes or peas, and only puts the washing machine on when she has a full load. P'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Hospitality 'struggling to survive' as bills rise She got rid of her car a number of years ago when ""the MOT would have cost more than the car was worth"" and is thankful for her senior bus pass, which at least enables her to visit friends and family for free. ""It's hard to know what to do to cut it down [further]. I am being as careful as I can,"" she said, adding she feels for people with children who have ""multiple loads of washing to do, school uniforms to buy"". ""I wouldn't have the heating on all the time. I'm one of 10 children. I was brought up with no gas or electric heating and I never have the heating above 20C,"" she said, adding she knew how to dress to stay warm in the house. One thing which does worry her is something like a dental emergency arising. Her dentist has moved from the NHS to private practice, and having had one tooth out while it was still an NHS practice she said she would not be able to afford to have similar treatment at the private rates. Gareth Collier has tried to make his house as energy efficient as possible In Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Gareth Collier has long been aware of the need to make his home as energy efficient as possible. After retiring from the merchant navy at the age of 56 in 2015 because he needed knee replacements, he had work done on his three-bedroom semi-detached house including This included a new roof and loft insulation, double-glazed windows and a new porch. For most of the winter, he only has radiators on in the living room and kitchen, and one in a bedroom running on a low setting. He has a smart home heating system and will turn the thermometer down from its usual position at 20C to 13C an hour before he leaves the house and let ""nature take its course"". What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? Energy bills could go up before October price rise Gareth uses smart meters to keep an eye on his energy usage, including one he can see in the kitchen. ""This year I have run a few experiments just to see consumption in certain conditions,"" he said. ""An electric double oven is a very thirsty item. I have a microwave, slow cooker and an air fryer and find these items much more efficient and quicker in the microwave case. ""I do economise where I can. One trick I have found is cooking hard boiled eggs off in the saucepan of my steamer set whilst steaming veg, gas hob cooking. The steamer itself is a very efficient way to cook, only one hob for all veg."" He says because he is currently on a fixed tariff with his energy supplier, he is not so worried for himself as the first round of price rises looms, but is concerned for others. ""It is very worrying for people on state pension and low earners,"" he said. ""Help must be given quickly to these groups.""

"Benjamin Mendy is accused of raping women at his Cheshire mansion A young woman tearfully told detectives how she woke up in bed with Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy raping her, a court has heard. The 28-year-old denies charges of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault. Chester Crown Court was played a police interview in which the woman, who was 19 at the time, said she went to the footballer's house in Cheshire after a night out in Manchester in July 2021. She said she fell asleep alone but ""woke up to find Ben on top of me"". The woman said in the interview played to the jury she had been drinking champagne with Mr Mendy, his friends and other young women at China White night club. She then returned to the footballer's mansion in Mottram St Andrew, near Prestbury. After spending time in the swimming pool, she said she became sleepy and went up to a top floor bedroom. She changed out of the bikini she had brought with her and into her underwear and fell asleep, alone, in the double bed, the court heard. Breaking down in tears, she said: ""I woke up to find Ben on top of me, but I was on my side. It was horrific, I was on my period. ""I remember five seconds of it and him putting a towel under me. ""I remember saying, 'No. I'm on my period'."" Louis Saha Matturie, 41, denies eight counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault The woman, who described herself as ""out of it"" or ""6/10"" drunk, is asked if there was ""any chance"" Mr Mendy could have thought she wanted to have sex with him that night. She replied: ""No, because I don't know him that well."" The woman told how two or three months before the alleged rape she had sex with Mendy ""like a one-night thing"", but that she was sober and it was consensual. Under cross-examination, Eleanor Laws QC, defending, suggested her account of what happened, waking up to find Mr Mendy raping her, was the ""exact same"" allegation made by her friend, who the footballer is also accused of raping the same evening. The witness replied: ""I have not spoken to her."" Mr Mendy denies the rape, in the early hours of 24 July 2021, along with the rape of two other young women over the same 24-hour period. He also denies five other counts of rape, one attempted rape and a sexual assault, all relating to seven young women, between October 2018 and August last year. His co-accused, Louis Saha Matturie, 41, of Eccles, Salford, denies eight counts of rape and four counts of sexual assault, relating to eight young women. Prosecutors have described Mr Mendy as a ""predator"" who they claim turned the pursuit of women for sex into a game. It is alleged Mr Matturie, Mr Mendy's friend and fixer, had the job of finding young women for sex. Both men deny any offences and maintain if any sex did take place with women or girls it was consensual. The trial continues.

"Russia has warned that it will not resume gas supplies along a key pipeline to Europe until sanctions are lifted. Moscow has blamed Western countries for its decision not to reopen the Nord Stream 1 pipeline after it was shut for three days for maintenance. When asked if supplies would resume pumping if sanctions were eased, a Kremlin spokesman said: ""Definitely"". Gas prices soared on Monday due to mounting concerns over energy supplies. The Dutch month-ahead wholesale gas price, a benchmark for Europe, was up as much as 30% in early trading on Monday. Prices in the UK rose as much as 35% before winding back to Â£4.50 per therm. Wholesale prices have been very volatile in recent weeks. They fell sharply last week when Germany announced that its gas storage facilities were filling up faster than expected. Europe has accused Russia of using gas supplies to blackmail European countries because of the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: ""Pumping problems arose because of sanctions imposed against our country and against a number of companies by Western states, including Germany and the UK. ""There are no other reasons that would lead to problems with pumping."" Last week, state energy firm Gazprom said that an oil leak in a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was behind the closure. But this has been disputed by the European Union and Siemens itself, the German firm which maintains the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work,"" Siemens said in a previous statement. No going back to reliance on Russian gas from here G7 agrees to impose price cap on Russian oil How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe While the UK is not reliant on Nord Stream 1 for its gas, the Kremlin's decision to squeeze supplies to Europe has driven up the overall cost of wholesale gas. The overall increase has been behind the spike in the energy bill price cap for consumers in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Peskov criticised European leaders for the surge in bills: ""It is obvious that Europe is getting worse for people, entrepreneurs, companies, to live and work: less money is being earned, the standard of living is falling,"" he said. Liz Truss, who will become the UK's prime minister on Tuesday, has promised to announce a planto deal with high energy bills soon after she enters office. However, UK businesses are not protected by a price cap and, last week, the British Chambers of Commerce warned firms would ""close their doors this winter"" if they were not given support with soaring bills. Energy expert Bill Farren-Price told the BBC's Today programme that the ""crunch moment"" would come later in the year if demand is particularly high for gas and is going to exceed what can be imported. He added that looking at action on energy bills would be the top priority for the incoming prime minister. A number of European governments have revealed plans to help businesses and consumers cope with surging energy costs. On Sunday,Germany announced a â¬65bn (Â£56.2bn) packagewhich includes one-off payments to the most vulnerable and tax breaks to energy-intensive firms. Over the weekend, Sweden and Finland also announced multi-billion pound packages to support energy companies. Other European ministers have accused Russia of using energy supplies as an economic weapon against those supporting Ukraine. Moscow has denied it is deliberately restricting exports in the run-up to winter. European governments are convinced Russia has weaponised the gas markets, by restricting supplies in order to push up prices. This makes life harder for businesses and consumers, and tests their own commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. But we know that Russia makes huge sums from exporting oil and gas, so how can it afford to do this, especially when it has a war to pay for? Well for a start, with prices sky-high, it can make the same amount of money from selling much less gas than would ordinarily be the case. Secondly, gas sales are much less important to Russia financially than oil exports. But Europe really needs Russian gas, because it has limited alternatives. So the gamble Moscow may be making is that while turning off the taps could ultimately hit its own revenues, its opponents will suffer a great deal more. The pipeline had been due to reopen on Saturday but Gazprom made the announcement on shutting the pipeline on Friday shortly afterthe G7 nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil in support of Ukraine. The introduction of a price cap means countries that sign up to the policy will be permitted to purchase only Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap. But Russia says it will not export to countries that participate in the cap. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said that Russia's actions could not only risk leading to a ""war winter"", but could potentially have a knock-on effect on businesses and its wider economy. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline stretches from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany and can carry up to 170 million cubic metres of gas a day. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is Gazprom. This is not the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the pipeline has been closed. In July, Gazprom cut off supplies completely for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again 10 days later, but at a much reduced level. On Monday, the Opec+ group of oil producing nations has announced a small cut to its output at its monthly meeting. Its members, which includes Russia, said production would be reduced by 100,000 barrels per day in October, reversing an increase the group now says was for September only. Analysts said the trim - announced following recent falls in crude oil prices - was largely symbolic.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"Edward Vines wrote to Emily Maitlis and her mother from prison A man who has an ""obsession"" with broadcaster Emily Maitlis has been given an eight-year prison sentence for repeatedly writing to her. Edward Vines was found guilty of attempting to breach a restraining order by writing to Ms Maitlis and her mother from prison. The restraining order was originally made 20 years ago, and the court heard Vines had persistently breached it. Nottingham Crown Court heard he knew Ms Maitlis from university. Judge Mark Watson said Vines had ""made it plain"" he would not stop trying to speak to the journalist. ""You are 52 years of age and you are a highly intelligent and articulate man,"" the judge told Vines. ""You are tortured, in my judgement, by your preoccupation with Emily Maitlis. It is an obsession from which you are unable to escape."" The judge said Edward Vines was ""unable to escape"" his obsession The letters were not read to the court but the judge said they did not contain ""threats or abuse"". ""They were an outpouring of emotions on your behalf,"" the judge said to Vines. He was convicted by a jury of eight counts of attempting to breach a restraining order. The court heard the letters did not actually reach Ms Maitlis and her mother because they were intercepted by staff at Nottingham Prison. ""The restraining order is meaningless to you,"" said the judge. ""The only thing stopping you from contacting Ms Maitlis is the protection given to her by your continued imprisonment."" Vines has allegedly offended again since his trial Prosecution barrister Ian Way said Vines had breached or attempted to breach the restraining order 20 times since it was originally made in 2002. Vines has previously been given prison sentences of four months, 18 months, 45 months, and three years, but his latest sentence is the longest. The judge told Vines that he will serve half of the eight-year sentence in prison before being released on licence. Before sentencing him, the judge asked Vines if he wanted to say anything in mitigation. Vines said that he does not ""cause any nuisance to anybody"" in prison. ""I'm the most innocent and unobtrusive prisoner in prison that there can be, and I'm told that,"" he said. He also said that he ""can't feel guilty"" because there had been no victim personal statements from Ms Maitlis and her mother. ""I'm oblivious to what's going through their minds,"" he said. The court heard that Vines has allegedly offended again since beingconvicted at his most recent trial in July, by writing to Ms Maitlis's mother. He is due to appear at Mansfield Magistrates' Court on 15 September in relation to this. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Liz Truss promised to ""deliver"" a Tory victory at the next general election Liz Truss has promised to deal with surging energy costs and to cut taxes, after she won the Tory leadership contest to become the next PM. Her plan, set to be announced on Thursday, is likely to include a freeze on energy bills - though precisely how it would work is still unclear. Ms Truss will be formally appointed by the Queen at Balmoral Castle later, after a final speech by Boris Johnson. The 47-year-old, the UK's third woman PM, will then appoint her cabinet. In her victory speech, Ms Truss promised a ""bold"" programme of tax cuts to grow the flagging economy and to prevent the UK tipping into recession. She will officially take the reins of power on Tuesday, bringing Mr Johnson's turbulent premiership to an end less than three years after the Conservatives' resounding election victory in 2019. Dorries and Patel to go as Truss takes over as PM Day one as PM: From kissing hands to exploding pizzas Liz Truss: From teenage Lib Dem to Tory PM Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss Ms Truss's most pressing decision as premier will be how best to shield households and businesses from the soaring international price of energy. On Monday, Ms Truss told party activists at London's Queen Elizabeth II conference centre she would ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills and boosting the UK's domestic energy sources. Under her plans, it is understood energy firmswould be able to take out government-backed loans, which they would use to freeze or lower customers' bills. The loans would be repaid from bills over the next 10-20 years. Scottish Power, which proposed government-backed loans, has estimated that freezing bills for two years could cost nearly Â£100bn. Small business are also expected to be offered some energy bill relief, though the details may not be included in Thursday's announcement. There will be very little if any honeymoon period for Liz Truss, as the country clamours for answers to huge questions the caretaker government of Boris Johnson in recent months felt unempowered to take on. As you can read from my colleagues, there is inflation, Ukraine, energy security, the NHS with winter approaching, the contrails of Brexit and... a general election that isn't far away. The Conservatives have consistently been some way behind Labour in the polls all year. And there has to be an election by January 2025 at the latest. Politics is being reset, but it will continue to be competitive, noisy and unpredictable. Read more from Chris Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of the vote, a narrower win than expected. Those predicted to join her top team include Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor, former leadership rival Suella Braverman as home secretary and James Cleverly as foreign secretary. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorriessaid they would step downas senior ministers once Ms Truss becomes prime minister. Mr Johnson congratulated Ms Truss on her victory and said she had the right plan to ""unite our party"". Ms Truss paid tribute to her ""friend"" Mr Johnson in her victory speech, adding he would be ""admired from Kyiv to Carlisle"" for his record in office. ""Boris, you got Brexit done, you crushed Jeremy Corbyn, you rolled out the vaccine and you stood up to Vladimir Putin,"" she said. In a break with tradition, the outgoing and incoming prime ministers are expected totravel to Balmoral Castle in Scotlandfor the handover of power, rather than Buckingham Palace. The Queen has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements. I will stand again as an MP, says Sunak What will Prime Minister Truss mean for Scotland? How has Liz Truss dealt with Northern Ireland? Ms Truss has promised Â£30bn in tax cuts in an emergency Budget later this month, having blamed the tax burden for the UK's sluggish growth. Her proposed cuts include reversing the rise in National Insurance under Mr Johnson's tenure, temporarily ditching green levies on energy bills, and scrapping a planned rise to corporation tax. As well as the domestic agenda, her in-tray also includes continuing to support Ukraine after its invasion by Russia and repairing a fractious relationship with the EU over Northern Ireland. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who attacked her economic plans during the campaign, told the BBC he would offer her his ""full support"". He said he will stand again to be an MP at the next general election, but is not expected to be in Ms Truss's cabinet. Labour has called on Ms Truss to expand the windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to part-fund a six month freeze to domestic prices. The party followed the Liberal Democrats earlier this summer in backing a freeze, along with the SNP. Ms Truss, however, has ruled out further windfall taxes,saying during the campaignit ""sends the wrong message to international investors"". Speaking earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pledged to work with Ms Truss to deliver a freeze, saying there was cross-party agreement on the idea. He criticised her approach on the economy, arguing she had talked more in her campaign about cutting taxes for businesses than the cost of living crisis. ""That shows that not only is she out of touch, but that she's not on the side of working people,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Breakfast Ms Truss's reported plan was not a freeze on energy bills but a loan and said instead energy companies should pay via a one-off tax on profits. ""What they are saying is families and pensioners should be paying for this for years to come,"" he said. SNP leader and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon called for the price freeze to include businesses, which are not normally covered by the UK'senergy price cap, and extra cash support.

"Strike action is expected to affect services in Craigavon, Coleraine and parts of Belfast Maintenance workers at the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) have begun strike action over pay. The trade union Unite said the dispute involves about 300 of its members and would remain in place for four weeks. NIHE said that based on previous experience, the dispute could affect maintenance services in Craigavon, Coleraine and north and west Belfast. It said it hoped to minimise disruption to its tenants and emergency repairs would be carried out. Speaking tothe BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, regional officer for Unite, Michael Keenan, said members are ""among the most vulnerable in society"". ""These people are desperate, this is why they're taking this action. ""Our members are among the lowest paid in Northern Ireland - they're visiting food banks, they just can't afford to work and that's why they've been forced into taking action."" Unite says the strike could have a ""severe impact"" on tenants ""We will contact tenants directly about postponements of scheduled repair works and tenants can continue to report repairs as normal through our usual channels. ""We will monitor the impact on tenants on a daily basis as the strike action continues."" The Housing Executive said pay was subject to national collective bargaining arrangements. It added: ""The pay award of 2021/22 for all Housing Executive staff was collectively agreed at a national level and the pay increases have already been implemented."" It said discussions were ongoing over a local claim submitted by Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (Nipsa) and Unite in June. Mr Keenan, from Unite, said the blame for the strike ""rests entirely with the Housing Executive"".

"The world's second-largest country by surface but relatively small in terms of population, Canada punches above its weight in economic terms. A federation of former British colonies, Canada follows the British pattern of parliamentary democracy. Ties with the US are now vital, especially in terms of trade, but Canada often goes its own way. Both English and French enjoy official status, and mainly French-speaking Quebec - where pressure for full sovereignty has abated in recent years - has wide-ranging cultural autonomy.

Trudeau's personal unpopularity with Canadians had become an increasing drag on his party's fortunes in advance of federal elections later in 2025.

"New Prime Minister Liz Truss used her victory speech to pledge to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills as well as supplies. A freeze on energy bills is understood to be one of a number of options being worked on to help struggling households to cope with soaring costs. It is expected that energy suppliers will be able to take out government-backed loans to subsidise bills. Energy bosses have been meeting with government officials on the matter. A Â£100bn plan to freeze household bills was proposed by energy companies last month. Under the proposal, bills would be subsidised and the current price cap of Â£1,971 for a typical family would be maintained for two years. The BBC understands that a similar scheme will be used to limit the energy price increases being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses. And bigger companies may be offered tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices. Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of party member votes to become the new Conservative leader. Speaking after the announcement, she said: ""I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people's energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply."" In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""There can be no justification for not freezing energy prices. ""There's a political consensus that needs to happen. She needs to ask the question, how she's going to pay for that? Labour made it clear, it needs to be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies."" Ms Truss's team is understood to have been working on a support package for energy bills ""for weeks"". An announcement on what they will do is pencilled in for this Thursday. ""Lots of measures have been considered, some have progressed and some have not,"" a source told the BBC. Business groups welcomed Ms Truss's appointment but urged her to take ""big bold action"" to help firms who, unlike households, are not protected by an energy price cap. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Martin McTague said soaring energy bills ""must be addressed urgently."" And Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said he was ""hopeful"" that businesses would receive help. ""The cliff edge that's coming on new energy contracts [for businesses] are astronomical, and need smoothing,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm pretty hopeful this week that not only will the new prime minister tackle energy bills for households, she'll also look at businesses too."" A freeze of the energy price cap - the limit on how much gas and electricity can cost in England, Scotland and Wales - would not necessarily require upfront government funding. In an article for the Financial Times,external, Ms Truss' close ally Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said a government led by her would borrow more to help people through ""exceptionally difficult times"" during the energy price shock. Mr Kwarteng - tipped to be named chancellor by Ms Truss - suggested he would look at the UK's rules on government borrowing and spending - called fiscal rules - to see if they still worked for the economy. The Treasury is allowed to suspend its fiscal rules in the event of a ""significant negative shock to the UK economy"". However, Mr Kwarteng sought to reassure markets that the UK had space to borrow more and that it would be done in a ""fiscally responsible way"". During the leadership race, Ms Truss said she would reverse a 1.25% rise in National Insurance and would suspend an increase in corporation tax - the measures will cost a combined Â£30bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the National Insurance cut would be of greater benefit to higher earners rather than those on lower income. During an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Truss said it was fair to givehigher earners more money back through tax cuts.and recent Tory policy had failed to grow the economy. A plan to freeze energy bills for households is striking in its simplicity for those facing a tough winter - until you start considering how it can be funded, and other details. It is likely to ultimately cost billions of pounds, and that may need to be paid back either through you paying extra on bills for the next decade, or through taxation if the government picks up the tab, or through extra borrowing. They would seem to be main options, given Liz Truss has been clear that she is not keen on a windfall tax on energy companies' profits. And, remember, the price cap only covers domestic bills in England, Wales, and Scotland. Will there be anything similar for billpayers in Northern Ireland who have also seen the cost of heating and lighting homes rise? What about small businesses, who are also seeing bills surge? We should not expect answers yet. We should wait for a policy announcement first. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said ""simply cutting taxes, cutting National Insurance contributions for example, is not a strategy for growth"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme these measures would come on top of the billions the government would have to spend to help with energy bills. ""We'll have not just extremely high borrowing in the short run but also additional inflationary pressure,"" he said. Last month, Labour said the government should freeze household energy bills, outlining a Â£29bn plan that would stop the energy price cap going up for all homes. At the time, Ms Truss dismissed the proposal as a ""sticking plaster"". Liz Truss beat Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest The Lib Dems have called for a price cap rise in October - which will take the typical household energy bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 - to be scrapped. It proposed that the cost be covered by a windfall tax on energy company profits. Ms Truss did not rule out a freeze during her Sunday interview with Laura Kuenssberg, but there is still a lack of clarity about how it could be funded. Derek Lickorish, chairman of pay-as-you-go energy supplier Utilita, said he and other industry bosses had been calling for a freeze to the energy price cap ""for some time"". ""We recognise it's going to be very expensive but if we don't the economy is going to crash and consumers won't know what to do, they won't know where to turn to for help,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

"Various arrests have been made in connection with the shooting death of Olivia Pratt-Korbel Police will identify those responsible for the murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel with the help of the local community, an assistant chief constable has said. Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green said already ""the community has stepped forward"". Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother tried to stop a gunman entering their house in Liverpool on 22 August. A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murderin the early hours of Sunday. He remains in custody and police were granted a further 36 hours on Monday night to continue questioning him. The same extension was also granted regarding two men, aged 29 and 41, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. A fourth man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Sunday night is also being questioned. Olivia's death was one of three fatal shootings within a week in the city. Appealing for information, Mr Green said: ""The community's been rocked and shocked by what has happened. Our thoughts and prayers go the families of the three people who have been killed over the last two weeks. ""But the community has stood strong and stepped forward. ""The response we have seen, whether it's providing information or just being resolute in a collective ambition to make sure that those individuals in our communities who are engaged in organised crime - the intimidation, the violence, the use of firearms - they've got no place in our society. ""The community has stepped forward and together we'll identify those responsible."" A tribute was paid to Olivia on the big screen at Goodison Park on Saturday He said dashcam footage, CCTV and other pieces of intelligence had been submitted by members of the public. Mr Green continued to appeal for information but said community support had already allowed officers to ""make investigative decisions and take action"" Police previously arrested two men, aged 33 and 36, on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder beforereleasing them on bail. The child was shot in the chest by a gunman who had chased convicted burglar Joseph Nee into her home on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at about 22:00 BST. Neither of the men who entered the home had any links to her family. Her mother Cheryl Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door on the shooter. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston 30 August, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest.

"Russia has warned that it will not resume gas supplies along a key pipeline to Europe until sanctions are lifted. Moscow has blamed Western countries for its decision not to reopen the Nord Stream 1 pipeline after it was shut for three days for maintenance. When asked if supplies would resume pumping if sanctions were eased, a Kremlin spokesman said: ""Definitely"". Gas prices soared on Monday due to mounting concerns over energy supplies. The Dutch month-ahead wholesale gas price, a benchmark for Europe, was up as much as 30% in early trading on Monday. Prices in the UK rose as much as 35% before winding back to Â£4.50 per therm. Wholesale prices have been very volatile in recent weeks. They fell sharply last week when Germany announced that its gas storage facilities were filling up faster than expected. Europe has accused Russia of using gas supplies to blackmail European countries because of the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: ""Pumping problems arose because of sanctions imposed against our country and against a number of companies by Western states, including Germany and the UK. ""There are no other reasons that would lead to problems with pumping."" Last week, state energy firm Gazprom said that an oil leak in a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was behind the closure. But this has been disputed by the European Union and Siemens itself, the German firm which maintains the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work,"" Siemens said in a previous statement. No going back to reliance on Russian gas from here G7 agrees to impose price cap on Russian oil How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe While the UK is not reliant on Nord Stream 1 for its gas, the Kremlin's decision to squeeze supplies to Europe has driven up the overall cost of wholesale gas. The overall increase has been behind the spike in the energy bill price cap for consumers in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Peskov criticised European leaders for the surge in bills: ""It is obvious that Europe is getting worse for people, entrepreneurs, companies, to live and work: less money is being earned, the standard of living is falling,"" he said. Liz Truss, who will become the UK's prime minister on Tuesday, has promised to announce a planto deal with high energy bills soon after she enters office. However, UK businesses are not protected by a price cap and, last week, the British Chambers of Commerce warned firms would ""close their doors this winter"" if they were not given support with soaring bills. Energy expert Bill Farren-Price told the BBC's Today programme that the ""crunch moment"" would come later in the year if demand is particularly high for gas and is going to exceed what can be imported. He added that looking at action on energy bills would be the top priority for the incoming prime minister. A number of European governments have revealed plans to help businesses and consumers cope with surging energy costs. On Sunday,Germany announced a â¬65bn (Â£56.2bn) packagewhich includes one-off payments to the most vulnerable and tax breaks to energy-intensive firms. Over the weekend, Sweden and Finland also announced multi-billion pound packages to support energy companies. Other European ministers have accused Russia of using energy supplies as an economic weapon against those supporting Ukraine. Moscow has denied it is deliberately restricting exports in the run-up to winter. European governments are convinced Russia has weaponised the gas markets, by restricting supplies in order to push up prices. This makes life harder for businesses and consumers, and tests their own commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. But we know that Russia makes huge sums from exporting oil and gas, so how can it afford to do this, especially when it has a war to pay for? Well for a start, with prices sky-high, it can make the same amount of money from selling much less gas than would ordinarily be the case. Secondly, gas sales are much less important to Russia financially than oil exports. But Europe really needs Russian gas, because it has limited alternatives. So the gamble Moscow may be making is that while turning off the taps could ultimately hit its own revenues, its opponents will suffer a great deal more. The pipeline had been due to reopen on Saturday but Gazprom made the announcement on shutting the pipeline on Friday shortly afterthe G7 nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil in support of Ukraine. The introduction of a price cap means countries that sign up to the policy will be permitted to purchase only Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap. But Russia says it will not export to countries that participate in the cap. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said that Russia's actions could not only risk leading to a ""war winter"", but could potentially have a knock-on effect on businesses and its wider economy. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline stretches from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany and can carry up to 170 million cubic metres of gas a day. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is Gazprom. This is not the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the pipeline has been closed. In July, Gazprom cut off supplies completely for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again 10 days later, but at a much reduced level. On Monday, the Opec+ group of oil producing nations has announced a small cut to its output at its monthly meeting. Its members, which includes Russia, said production would be reduced by 100,000 barrels per day in October, reversing an increase the group now says was for September only. Analysts said the trim - announced following recent falls in crude oil prices - was largely symbolic.

"Liz Truss has lost her seat in Parliament in the general election, nearly two years after she resigned as the UK's shortest serving prime minister. Here's what you need to know about her if you don't regularly follow politics. Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as leader and became PM on 6 September then resigned 45 days later. The previous record was set at 119 days by George Canning who died in office in 1827. With her support, finance minster Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled Â£45bn of tax cuts in her third week as PM. But the plans were widely blamed for reducing the value of the pound and panicked financial markets. Almost all of it has now been reversed - and Kwarteng was sacked as chancellor. Dozens of Tories called on her to step down and her Home Secretary Suella Braverman resigned. She had to hire former rivals Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt to plug the gaps in her top team. She had pledged to cut taxes and boost the economy but in her resignation speech outside Downing Street, she said: ""I recognise that I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party."" Only Conservative MPs and party members got to vote to make her leader. After two months of voting between two Tory heavyweights she beat the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the final round. He became PM after she resigned then she lost her seat in the 2024 general election. She lost the race to be MP for South West Norfolk in 2024. She held the seat from 2010, and won by more than 26,000 votes in 2019. Before politics she worked for Shell and Cable & Wireless. She is married and has two daughters.

"The soaring cost of living is one of the big issues facing the new prime minister Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. What do Covid, Ukraine and droughts have to do with my bills? Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS workers have threatened to strike over pay, as the cost of living crisis follows the pandemic NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E. There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places. The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation. Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses. But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine. There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies. As UK counts pennies, we count casualties - Zelenska Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties. If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing. Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies. Boris Johnson's track record as PM Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements. The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont. After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Nicola Sturgeon is proposing to hold a second independence referendum in October 2023 Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023. In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it. In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further. Is indyref2 showdown Nicola Sturgeon's last stand? Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind. Both are currently stymied by the planning process. Could that be simplified to speed up the transition to renewables? Early indications are that the answer will be no. Can the UK afford its net zero policies? Queen to stay at Balmoral to appoint new PM What does the prime minister do? Johnson on his legacy as PM: Only time will tell.

"Various arrests have been made in connection with the shooting death of Olivia Pratt-Korbel Police will identify those responsible for the murder of Olivia Pratt-Korbel with the help of the local community, an assistant chief constable has said. Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green said already ""the community has stepped forward"". Nine-year-old Olivia was killed as her mother tried to stop a gunman entering their house in Liverpool on 22 August. A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murderin the early hours of Sunday. He remains in custody and police were granted a further 36 hours on Monday night to continue questioning him. The same extension was also granted regarding two men, aged 29 and 41, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. A fourth man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender on Sunday night is also being questioned. Olivia's death was one of three fatal shootings within a week in the city. Appealing for information, Mr Green said: ""The community's been rocked and shocked by what has happened. Our thoughts and prayers go the families of the three people who have been killed over the last two weeks. ""But the community has stood strong and stepped forward. ""The response we have seen, whether it's providing information or just being resolute in a collective ambition to make sure that those individuals in our communities who are engaged in organised crime - the intimidation, the violence, the use of firearms - they've got no place in our society. ""The community has stepped forward and together we'll identify those responsible."" A tribute was paid to Olivia on the big screen at Goodison Park on Saturday He said dashcam footage, CCTV and other pieces of intelligence had been submitted by members of the public. Mr Green continued to appeal for information but said community support had already allowed officers to ""make investigative decisions and take action"" Police previously arrested two men, aged 33 and 36, on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder beforereleasing them on bail. The child was shot in the chest by a gunman who had chased convicted burglar Joseph Nee into her home on Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, at about 22:00 BST. Neither of the men who entered the home had any links to her family. Her mother Cheryl Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door on the shooter. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston 30 August, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. Merseyside Police has appealed for the public to come forward with information But she was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. A minute's applausewas held nine minutes into the Everton v Liverpool gameon Saturday. An anti-knife and gun crime banner was unfurled in the Bullens Road stand at the Premier League game stretching across both Everton and Liverpool supporters. Olivia's funeral is due to take place at St Margaret Mary's Church in Dovecot on 15 September and her family has asked mourners to wear a ""splash of pink"" for the service.

"Russia has warned that it will not resume gas supplies along a key pipeline to Europe until sanctions are lifted. Moscow has blamed Western countries for its decision not to reopen the Nord Stream 1 pipeline after it was shut for three days for maintenance. When asked if supplies would resume pumping if sanctions were eased, a Kremlin spokesman said: ""Definitely"". Gas prices soared on Monday due to mounting concerns over energy supplies. The Dutch month-ahead wholesale gas price, a benchmark for Europe, was up as much as 30% in early trading on Monday. Prices in the UK rose as much as 35% before winding back to Â£4.50 per therm. Wholesale prices have been very volatile in recent weeks. They fell sharply last week when Germany announced that its gas storage facilities were filling up faster than expected. Europe has accused Russia of using gas supplies to blackmail European countries because of the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: ""Pumping problems arose because of sanctions imposed against our country and against a number of companies by Western states, including Germany and the UK. ""There are no other reasons that would lead to problems with pumping."" Last week, state energy firm Gazprom said that an oil leak in a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was behind the closure. But this has been disputed by the European Union and Siemens itself, the German firm which maintains the turbine. ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work,"" Siemens said in a previous statement. No going back to reliance on Russian gas from here G7 agrees to impose price cap on Russian oil How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe While the UK is not reliant on Nord Stream 1 for its gas, the Kremlin's decision to squeeze supplies to Europe has driven up the overall cost of wholesale gas. The overall increase has been behind the spike in the energy bill price cap for consumers in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Peskov criticised European leaders for the surge in bills: ""It is obvious that Europe is getting worse for people, entrepreneurs, companies, to live and work: less money is being earned, the standard of living is falling,"" he said. Liz Truss, who will become the UK's prime minister on Tuesday, has promised to announce a planto deal with high energy bills soon after she enters office. However, UK businesses are not protected by a price cap and, last week, the British Chambers of Commerce warned firms would ""close their doors this winter"" if they were not given support with soaring bills. Energy expert Bill Farren-Price told the BBC's Today programme that the ""crunch moment"" would come later in the year if demand is particularly high for gas and is going to exceed what can be imported. He added that looking at action on energy bills would be the top priority for the incoming prime minister. A number of European governments have revealed plans to help businesses and consumers cope with surging energy costs. On Sunday,Germany announced a â¬65bn (Â£56.2bn) packagewhich includes one-off payments to the most vulnerable and tax breaks to energy-intensive firms. Over the weekend, Sweden and Finland also announced multi-billion pound packages to support energy companies. Other European ministers have accused Russia of using energy supplies as an economic weapon against those supporting Ukraine. Moscow has denied it is deliberately restricting exports in the run-up to winter. European governments are convinced Russia has weaponised the gas markets, by restricting supplies in order to push up prices. This makes life harder for businesses and consumers, and tests their own commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. But we know that Russia makes huge sums from exporting oil and gas, so how can it afford to do this, especially when it has a war to pay for? Well for a start, with prices sky-high, it can make the same amount of money from selling much less gas than would ordinarily be the case. Secondly, gas sales are much less important to Russia financially than oil exports. But Europe really needs Russian gas, because it has limited alternatives. So the gamble Moscow may be making is that while turning off the taps could ultimately hit its own revenues, its opponents will suffer a great deal more. The pipeline had been due to reopen on Saturday but Gazprom made the announcement on shutting the pipeline on Friday shortly afterthe G7 nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil in support of Ukraine. The introduction of a price cap means countries that sign up to the policy will be permitted to purchase only Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap. But Russia says it will not export to countries that participate in the cap. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said that Russia's actions could not only risk leading to a ""war winter"", but could potentially have a knock-on effect on businesses and its wider economy. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline stretches from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany and can carry up to 170 million cubic metres of gas a day. It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is Gazprom. This is not the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the pipeline has been closed. In July, Gazprom cut off supplies completely for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again 10 days later, but at a much reduced level. On Monday, the Opec+ group of oil producing nations has announced a small cut to its output at its monthly meeting. Its members, which includes Russia, said production would be reduced by 100,000 barrels per day in October, reversing an increase the group now says was for September only. Analysts said the trim - announced following recent falls in crude oil prices - was largely symbolic.

"Australian liquor store Dan Murphy's is offering on-the-spot job interviews in 10-minute slots because of a staff shortage ahead of Christmas. During the hiring week from Monday until Sunday, the business aims to take on more than 2,200 casual workers. The country is seeing one of its tightest jobs markets in nearly 50 years with the unemployment rate at a record low of 3.5%.

"The soaring cost of living is one of the big issues facing the new prime minister Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. What do Covid, Ukraine and droughts have to do with my bills? Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS workers have threatened to strike over pay, as the cost of living crisis follows the pandemic NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E. There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places. The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation. Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses. But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine. There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies. As UK counts pennies, we count casualties - Zelenska Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties. If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing. Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies. Boris Johnson's track record as PM Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements. The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont. After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Nicola Sturgeon is proposing to hold a second independence referendum in October 2023 Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023. In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it. In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further. Is indyref2 showdown Nicola Sturgeon's last stand? Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"The soaring cost of living is one of the big issues facing the new prime minister Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. What do Covid, Ukraine and droughts have to do with my bills? Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS workers have threatened to strike over pay, as the cost of living crisis follows the pandemic NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E. There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places. The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation. Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses. But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine. There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies.

"Boris Johnson is unlikely to be requiring the services of his local job centre Just three years after leading the Conservatives to their biggest election victory in 30 years, Boris Johnson is stepping down as prime minister. The man who dreamed as a child of being ""world king"" is now planning his next career move. His biographer Andrew Gimson says he is not ""the sort of person who would go to the country and do lots of good work for the local church and live a life of blameless obscurity"". So what could he do next? Mr Johnson had a highly-paid career in journalism before entering politics and continued to write for newspapers and magazines as he climbed the greasy pole at Westminster - only giving it up days before he became PM. This video can not be played Boris Johnson has refused to rule out political comeback He had been paid Â£275,000 a year to write a weekly column for the Daily Telegraph and there could be a media bidding war to secure the former PM's services. He may also be tempted by offers to write his memoirs, a guaranteed earner for former prime ministers.Literary agents have predicted,externalhe could be paid ""north of Â£1m"" for a book on his time in power. Mr Johnson has already written eight books (if you count collections of his newspaper columns), including a best-selling biography of his hero, Winston Churchill, and the political satire Seventy-two Virgins. Laura Kuenssberg: The inside story of Boris Johnson's downfall Five things that led to Boris Johnson's downfall But his first post-Downing Street task will be finally to finish his biography of William Shakespeare, which he has been writing, on and off, for the past seven years. Publishers Hodder & Stoughton bought the rights to ""Shakespeare: The Riddle of Genius"" in 2015, for a reported Â£500,000. The book was due out in 2016. But winning the Brexit vote, becoming foreign secretary and then prime minister derailed Mr Johnson's writing schedule. ""Shakespeare is about power and about when it's right to rebel and kill a king,"" according to Mr Gimson, who has a second volume of his biography on Mr Johnson coming out next month. ""Now his own party will turn against him he may have a ready-made ending to his book."" Mr Johnson's speeches have been the main attraction at Conservative party conference for many years One way former prime ministers can make a large amount of money is through public speaking. Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May has earned Â£715,000 from making nine speeches in 2022 alone. Mr Johnson's talent for comedy made him a favourite on the after-dinner circuit before he gained power. But he can also turn his hand to more heavyweight fare. In March 2019, when he was between government roles, he waspaid more than Â£160,000,externalfor giving two speeches - to a bank and an Indian media group. ""Undoubtedly he will do a lot of writing and speaking,"" says Lord Udny-Lister, a long-time advisor to Mr Johnson. Lord Udny-Lister, who served as Mr Jonson's chief of staff while mayor and again as prime minister, said his old boss ""will speak on subjects close to his heart"" after he stands down. ""Things like Ukraine, where you can already see the western alliance sagging,"" the Conservative peer added. The financial benefits of a speaking career will not be lost on the ex-PM, says Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. ""By all accounts, Boris Johnson is obsessed with money and his lack thereof compared to so many of his friends. He will do whatever he can to put that situation right."" There has been a lot of speculation about whether Mr Johnson will remain as an MP. It seems unlikely that he will be offered a cabinet job by the next PM. So it would mean a return to the backbenches - something he has done before after political setbacks. No matter what happens he will be banned from directly lobbying the government for two years after leaving office, under the Ministerial Code. ""I don't see him walking away from parliament that quickly,"" Lord Udny-Lister said. ""But I don't think he's going to just sit there throwing rocks from the back bench either."" Mr Johnson's hand could be forced if he is found to have misled parliament over parties in Downing Street during lockdown bya committee of MPs, which could lead to him being suspended from the Commons.  And with a majority of 7,100, he is not certain to retain his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat at the next election, if there is a significant swing away from the Conservatives. Removal vans have already been spotted in Downing Street In hisfinal appearance at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson declared ""mission largely accomplished, for now"" before signing-off with ""hasta la vista, baby."" He could only have dropped a heavier hint that he was not finished yet if he had used another catchphrase from the Terminator films: ""I'll be back."" Could he really return, perhaps as leader of the opposition if his successor loses the next general election? Prof Bale, who has written a history of the Conservative Party, said a return can't be ruled out, but he argues the party would have to be ""pretty desperate"". ""It would make me seriously worried about the future of the Conservative Party if they returned to Boris Johnson,"" he added. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a long-time ally of Mr Johnson, who did not want him to quit, recently pointed out no one had come back having lost the leadership since William Gladstone. But Mr Gimson is not concerned about historical comparisons. ""No matter what he does, there will remain a cult of Boris Johnson. Lots of people have been prime minister two or three times with a gap"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson pledges to give his ""full and unqualified support"" to whoever takes over from him in No 10.

"The soaring cost of living is one of the big issues facing the new prime minister Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. What do Covid, Ukraine and droughts have to do with my bills? Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS workers have threatened to strike over pay, as the cost of living crisis follows the pandemic NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E. There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places. The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation. Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses. But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine. There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies. As UK counts pennies, we count casualties - Zelenska Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties. If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing. Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies. Boris Johnson's track record as PM Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements. The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont. After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Nicola Sturgeon is proposing to hold a second independence referendum in October 2023 Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023. In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it. In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further. Is indyref2 showdown Nicola Sturgeon's last stand? Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind. Both are currently stymied by the planning process. Could that be simplified to speed up the transition to renewables? Early indications are that the answer will be no. Can the UK afford its net zero policies? Queen to stay at Balmoral to appoint new PM What does the prime minister do? Johnson on his legacy as PM: Only time will tell.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

As the BBC's Political Editor Chris Masonreports, we can expect Liz Truss's cabinet to include Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, Home Secretary Suella Braverman and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly. While these appointments won't be announced until tomorrow, when Truss formally takes office, here's a quick summary of the trio. Kwasi Kwarteng  Suella Braverman  James Cleverly Help for consumers' energy costs is to be provided by allowing energy suppliers to take out government-backed loans to allow them to subsidise bills. The plan, which had been suggested by the energy industry, is set to be announced on Thursday. The ""deficit reduction scheme"" is expected to form the centrepiece of the government's attempt to tackle the high cost of energy for consumers. Smaller firms are expected to be offered similar help to that of households, although the BBC understands the details of how businesses will be helped may not be ironed out in time to be included in Thursday's energy announcement. It is also understood that bigger companies may be offered bespoke tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices. You can read morehere Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At one stage this summer, Priti Patel considered a leadership bid of her own. At least a dozen colleagues pressed her to do so. But she swithered. And some who would have supported her began to declare for other candidates. She - like the final two in the contest - was one of the most senior members of Boris Johnsonâs government. Insiders suggest she didnât discern any abilities in them that she didnât possess herself. So she endorsed neither of them - a potentially career-limiting move. While she would have been happy to stay at the Home Office, the rumours that Suella Braverman would replace her were solidified by sources close to Liz Truss. At that point, Priti Patel probably decided to jump before she was pushed - though she sent her resignation pointedly to the current prime minister, not his successor. Thus the process of transition in government has begun. And the speculation is whether Sunak supporter Dominic Raab may now follow suit. And now some more reaction from Thetford, a town in Liz Truss' constituency South West Norfolk. Debbie Smith,
39, a lab technician and mother of two currently on maternity leave, says she wants Truss to deal with the cost of energy when she becomes prime minister. âEspecially living in an older house
with the gas, thatâs going to be a killer for us"", says Debbie. ""Weâre going to
have to tighten the belts on everything but weâll get through it, weâll do it,â she says. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The talk of the town here in Belgium isn't the soon-to-be new UK prime minister - although it is being mentioned here and there. It is very much the
energy crisis - especially after theclosure of Nord Stream 1. But if you look at some of the congratulatory words coming
from the European Commission, the message is caveated. Hopes for a constructive relationship are combined with
calls for the UK to ârespectâ or âcomplyâ with Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit treaty, governing trade arrangements for
Northern Ireland, has never been fully implemented. And this year, the UK government worked up plans to
potentially override parts of it altogether - with the architect none other than Liz Truss, as foreign secretary. So Britainâs argument, that problems with the treaty are
baked into the text, isnât likely to change. But one thing to watch for is whether a Truss government
does decide to gives talks with Brussels another whirl. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Energy company bosses met with government ministers today to discuss âtheir partâ in planned interventions by Liz Truss's government. âWe are moving quickly to support the public with the impact of high energy prices, caused by Putinâs weaponisation of energy,"" said a government spokesman. The spokesman said energy company CEOs are clear that they understand the scale of the challenge and the need ""to play their part to ensure the success of the Governmentâs planned intervention"". Mark EastonHome Editor Priti Patelâs letter to Boris Johnson lists what
she regards as her achievements as Home Secretary: more police officers, a
points-based immigration system, asylum reform and her deal with Rwanda. But
whoever takes over at the Home Office will inherit a department with chronic
and profound challenges: David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon wants good relationship with Liz Truss Back within the UK, Liz Truss will be the fourth Conservative
Prime Minister that Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will work
alongside. Speaking to broadcasters this afternoon, the
SNP leader extended an invitation for Truss to come to Edinburgh. Sturgeon said despite political
differences she hoped to work ""constructively"" with the new
Conservative leader. Perhaps comments from earlier in the leadership contest
whenTruss called Sturgeon an ""attention-seeker""can be
swept aside? Sturgeon wants to hold
another independence referendum in the coming months, but Truss opposes the
idea of another vote. Even  so, it's hard to see how the relationship between these two politicians could get much
worse than the one that existed between Sturgeon and Boris Johnson. In her victory speech, Liz Truss said Johnson was ""admired from Kyiv to Carlisle"". Sturgeon
suggested this was an ""honest reflection"" of Johnson's lack of
popularity north of the border. Global leaders have been sending their congratulations to Liz Truss - but in the international media, there have been snarkier remarks, too. ""She has gone to see the Queen,"" saidRussiantelevision presenter Ivan Trushkin. ""If she [the Queen] recognises her of course."" InFrance, meanwhile, she has been branded not the Iron Lady - former UK PM Margaret Thatcher's nickname - but the Iron Weathercock - in reference to Truss's changing views on the UK leaving the European Union. Italy'sCorriere della Sera,externalcompares Truss to Thatcher - but describes the new leader's speeches as more ""robotic"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholzcongratulated Truss,externaland said London and Berlin would carry on cooperating as ""partners and friends"" during ""these challenging times"". Read more here. It's time for a quick recap on what's been a big day for the Conservative Party, and for UK politics. Here are some key things to know: A little more now on reaction to Liz Truss's victory today, and Labour's Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says she needs a plan to tackle soaring inflation and the rising cost of energy. Khan came in for criticism from both candidates as they fought for the leadership. ""If Liz Truss is going to be continuity Boris Johnson, that's a problem for us,"" he tells the BBC. ""We come clearly from different political traditions but we share a common desire to see our capital city and country succeeding. ""She takes over during a time of national crisis. Families, communities and businesses are seeing economic pain they have not seen since the 2008 economic banking crash and even worse than the pandemic,"" he says. ""For the last two months we've see a zombie government and candidates distracted by tribal party politics. ""I've been speaking to parents skipping a meal so their kids can eat, pensioners who have not turned a fan on during the heatwave because they're concerned about their bills. All the time the government missing in action."" In her resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Priti Patel says ""it has been the honour of my life to serve our country as home secretary for the last three years and to deliver on our commitments to back and reform our police, stand up for the hard-working law-abiding majority, reform our immigration and asylum system, and fight terrorism"". ""Your support over this period has delivered an unparalleled package of reforms and investment."" Speaking about policies on migration and slavery, including the Rwanda asylum scheme, Patel said: ""As we know, there is no single solution to this huge challenge and the Government must tackle the full spectrum of issues to halt the illegal entry of migrants to the UK."" ""I congratulate Liz Truss on being elected our new leader, and will give her my support as our new prime minister."" She continues: ""It is my choice to continue my public service to the country and the Witham constituency from the backbenchers, once Liz formally assumes office and a new home secretary is appointed."" ""From the backbenches, I will champion many of the policies I have stood up for both inside and outside government."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she is resigning as Home Secretary. In a letter to Boris Johnson, Patel says it is ""my choice"" to serve from the backbenches. She adds that it is ""vital"" that Liz Truss backs ""all aspects"" of her policies to tackle illegal immigration. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC reporters were out and about in Redcar, North Yorkshire this morning - one of the so-called Red Wall constituencies that switched from Labour to the Conservatives in the 2019 election. They asked people what they think Liz Truss should do when she becomes prime minister. Paul Wigham, 65 â retired Paul Wigham, who is retired, says: ""Hoping, desperately
hoping for some help, for the young âuns, for people whose electricity power and
gas prices have just got ridiculous. Iâm expecting some very serious actions."" Judy Sharples, 59 â works in a residential home for profoundly deaf and disabled people Judy Sharples works in a residential home for profoundly deaf and disabled people. She says she wants to be able to live comfortably and not struggle to pay bills. ""Weâre going to end up
sitting in blankets like they did in the 50s and 40s,"" she says. ""Itâs not on... I donât think anybody
can sort it out unless they all start working together."" Christopher Carter, 36 â works in retail Retail worker Christopher Carter says he wants honesty from the government about why energy prices are ""going through the roof"". He believes it's because the government has failed to provide alternative energy sources. ""Theyâve been in
charge for 12 years. Theyâve done nothing
with nuclear, theyâve pulled back the solar benefit, they pulled back wind and
the planning permissions,"" he says. Rhona Skelton, 91 (L) and Angela Bennett, 58 - support worker Rhona, aged 91, thinks Liz Truss will do a good job: ""Iâm sure she will but
thereâs a terrible mess everywhere."" Angela says Truss needs to sort out the energy crisis because it affects low-paid workers, like herself. ""I havenât got much
confidence,"" she says, ""they say theyâre
going to do one thing and then U-turn and do something else"". In a blow to both the outgoing and incoming prime minister, it looks set torain on and off for much of tomorrow in Westminster. This may put a dampener on the speeches due to be held outside Downing Street, but it's unclear if it will affect the plans for Boris Johnson and Liz Truss to travel to the Scottish Highlands to see the Queen. With the weather not looking much better in Balmoral, it could affect the timing of Johnson's speech in the morning, as well as force Truss inside for her first address to the nation in the afternoon. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered congratulations to Liz Truss and said France is ""ready to work together as allies and friends"" . Speaking during a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Macron said both France and the UK ""have the same values, a history of friendship, we face common challenges"". It comes after Truss'controversial remarks about the French leader, when she said the ""jury is out"" in response to a question whether he is is a ""friend or foe"" of the UK. Following the remarks, Macronwarned of ""serious problems"" for France-UK relations, but insisted the UK remained an ally despite the occasional error made by its leaders. The UK is a great country committed with us to defend the values of democracy alongside Ukraine and which also needs to strengthen its energy sovereignty and win the battle against climate change."" French President Emmanuel Macron Rishi Sunak says he intends to continue as the MP for Richmond. The defeated Conservative leadership candidate has told the BBC he will contest the seat at the next general election.Asked about higher political ambitions, he said it has been a privilege to serve as chancellor, and that he will now be focused on supporting his constituents and giving Liz Truss his ""full support"". This video can not be played Rishi Sunak plans to stay on as MP and will stand again Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With Liz Truss's victory still fresh, there is a desire amongst some of her critics to avoid being accused of devouring sour grapes, so they have been publicly circumspect in their reaction. But concerns privately about her ability to unite a divided party persist. One former cabinet minister, tongue firmly in cheek, said he was sure ""she will be a complete triumph"" before adding that there was ""precious little sign of her reaching out"" to internal sceptics. ""We can only live in hope,"" he said, but mooted senior appointments appear to be confined overwhelmingly to allies. Another former minister went as far as warning that if ""divisions persist"" she could follow Boris Johnson out of the No 10 door before the next election. Bear in mind she hasn't yet crossed the threshold as PM yet. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February.

Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.

Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.

"New Prime Minister Liz Truss used her victory speech to pledge to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills as well as supplies. A freeze on energy bills is understood to be one of a number of options being worked on to help struggling households to cope with soaring costs. It is expected that energy suppliers will be able to take out government-backed loans to subsidise bills. Energy bosses have been meeting with government officials on the matter. A Â£100bn plan to freeze household bills was proposed by energy companies last month. Under the proposal, bills would be subsidised and the current price cap of Â£1,971 for a typical family would be maintained for two years. The BBC understands that a similar scheme will be used to limit the energy price increases being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses. And bigger companies may be offered tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices. Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of party member votes to become the new Conservative leader. Speaking after the announcement, she said: ""I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people's energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply."" In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""There can be no justification for not freezing energy prices. ""There's a political consensus that needs to happen. She needs to ask the question, how she's going to pay for that? Labour made it clear, it needs to be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies."" Ms Truss's team is understood to have been working on a support package for energy bills ""for weeks"". An announcement on what they will do is pencilled in for this Thursday. ""Lots of measures have been considered, some have progressed and some have not,"" a source told the BBC. Business groups welcomed Ms Truss's appointment but urged her to take ""big bold action"" to help firms who, unlike households, are not protected by an energy price cap. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Martin McTague said soaring energy bills ""must be addressed urgently."" And Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said he was ""hopeful"" that businesses would receive help. ""The cliff edge that's coming on new energy contracts [for businesses] are astronomical, and need smoothing,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm pretty hopeful this week that not only will the new prime minister tackle energy bills for households, she'll also look at businesses too."" A freeze of the energy price cap - the limit on how much gas and electricity can cost in England, Scotland and Wales - would not necessarily require upfront government funding. In an article for the Financial Times,external, Ms Truss' close ally Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said a government led by her would borrow more to help people through ""exceptionally difficult times"" during the energy price shock. Mr Kwarteng - tipped to be named chancellor by Ms Truss - suggested he would look at the UK's rules on government borrowing and spending - called fiscal rules - to see if they still worked for the economy. The Treasury is allowed to suspend its fiscal rules in the event of a ""significant negative shock to the UK economy"". However, Mr Kwarteng sought to reassure markets that the UK had space to borrow more and that it would be done in a ""fiscally responsible way"". During the leadership race, Ms Truss said she would reverse a 1.25% rise in National Insurance and would suspend an increase in corporation tax - the measures will cost a combined Â£30bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the National Insurance cut would be of greater benefit to higher earners rather than those on lower income. During an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Truss said it was fair to givehigher earners more money back through tax cuts.and recent Tory policy had failed to grow the economy. A plan to freeze energy bills for households is striking in its simplicity for those facing a tough winter - until you start considering how it can be funded, and other details. It is likely to ultimately cost billions of pounds, and that may need to be paid back either through you paying extra on bills for the next decade, or through taxation if the government picks up the tab, or through extra borrowing. They would seem to be main options, given Liz Truss has been clear that she is not keen on a windfall tax on energy companies' profits. And, remember, the price cap only covers domestic bills in England, Wales, and Scotland. Will there be anything similar for billpayers in Northern Ireland who have also seen the cost of heating and lighting homes rise? What about small businesses, who are also seeing bills surge? We should not expect answers yet. We should wait for a policy announcement first. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said ""simply cutting taxes, cutting National Insurance contributions for example, is not a strategy for growth"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme these measures would come on top of the billions the government would have to spend to help with energy bills. ""We'll have not just extremely high borrowing in the short run but also additional inflationary pressure,"" he said. Last month, Labour said the government should freeze household energy bills, outlining a Â£29bn plan that would stop the energy price cap going up for all homes. At the time, Ms Truss dismissed the proposal as a ""sticking plaster"". Liz Truss beat Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest The Lib Dems have called for a price cap rise in October - which will take the typical household energy bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 - to be scrapped. It proposed that the cost be covered by a windfall tax on energy company profits. Ms Truss did not rule out a freeze during her Sunday interview with Laura Kuenssberg, but there is still a lack of clarity about how it could be funded. Derek Lickorish, chairman of pay-as-you-go energy supplier Utilita, said he and other industry bosses had been calling for a freeze to the energy price cap ""for some time"". ""We recognise it's going to be very expensive but if we don't the economy is going to crash and consumers won't know what to do, they won't know where to turn to for help,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

"The soaring cost of living is one of the big issues facing the new prime minister Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. What do Covid, Ukraine and droughts have to do with my bills? Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS workers have threatened to strike over pay, as the cost of living crisis follows the pandemic NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E. There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places. The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation. Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses. But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine. There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies. As UK counts pennies, we count casualties - Zelenska Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties. If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing. Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies. Boris Johnson's track record as PM Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements. The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont. After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Nicola Sturgeon is proposing to hold a second independence referendum in October 2023 Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023. In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it. In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further. Is indyref2 showdown Nicola Sturgeon's last stand? Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"New Prime Minister Liz Truss used her victory speech to pledge to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills as well as supplies. A freeze on energy bills is understood to be one of a number of options being worked on to help struggling households to cope with soaring costs. It is expected that energy suppliers will be able to take out government-backed loans to subsidise bills. Energy bosses have been meeting with government officials on the matter. A Â£100bn plan to freeze household bills was proposed by energy companies last month. Under the proposal, bills would be subsidised and the current price cap of Â£1,971 for a typical family would be maintained for two years. The BBC understands that a similar scheme will be used to limit the energy price increases being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses. And bigger companies may be offered tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices. Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of party member votes to become the new Conservative leader. Speaking after the announcement, she said: ""I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people's energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply."" In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""There can be no justification for not freezing energy prices. ""There's a political consensus that needs to happen. She needs to ask the question, how she's going to pay for that? Labour made it clear, it needs to be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies."" Ms Truss's team is understood to have been working on a support package for energy bills ""for weeks"". An announcement on what they will do is pencilled in for this Thursday. ""Lots of measures have been considered, some have progressed and some have not,"" a source told the BBC. Business groups welcomed Ms Truss's appointment but urged her to take ""big bold action"" to help firms who, unlike households, are not protected by an energy price cap. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Martin McTague said soaring energy bills ""must be addressed urgently."" And Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said he was ""hopeful"" that businesses would receive help. ""The cliff edge that's coming on new energy contracts [for businesses] are astronomical, and need smoothing,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm pretty hopeful this week that not only will the new prime minister tackle energy bills for households, she'll also look at businesses too."" A freeze of the energy price cap - the limit on how much gas and electricity can cost in England, Scotland and Wales - would not necessarily require upfront government funding. In an article for the Financial Times,external, Ms Truss' close ally Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said a government led by her would borrow more to help people through ""exceptionally difficult times"" during the energy price shock. Mr Kwarteng - tipped to be named chancellor by Ms Truss - suggested he would look at the UK's rules on government borrowing and spending - called fiscal rules - to see if they still worked for the economy. The Treasury is allowed to suspend its fiscal rules in the event of a ""significant negative shock to the UK economy"". However, Mr Kwarteng sought to reassure markets that the UK had space to borrow more and that it would be done in a ""fiscally responsible way"". During the leadership race, Ms Truss said she would reverse a 1.25% rise in National Insurance and would suspend an increase in corporation tax - the measures will cost a combined Â£30bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the National Insurance cut would be of greater benefit to higher earners rather than those on lower income. During an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Truss said it was fair to givehigher earners more money back through tax cuts.and recent Tory policy had failed to grow the economy. A plan to freeze energy bills for households is striking in its simplicity for those facing a tough winter - until you start considering how it can be funded, and other details. It is likely to ultimately cost billions of pounds, and that may need to be paid back either through you paying extra on bills for the next decade, or through taxation if the government picks up the tab, or through extra borrowing. They would seem to be main options, given Liz Truss has been clear that she is not keen on a windfall tax on energy companies' profits. And, remember, the price cap only covers domestic bills in England, Wales, and Scotland. Will there be anything similar for billpayers in Northern Ireland who have also seen the cost of heating and lighting homes rise? What about small businesses, who are also seeing bills surge? We should not expect answers yet. We should wait for a policy announcement first. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said ""simply cutting taxes, cutting National Insurance contributions for example, is not a strategy for growth"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme these measures would come on top of the billions the government would have to spend to help with energy bills. ""We'll have not just extremely high borrowing in the short run but also additional inflationary pressure,"" he said. Last month, Labour said the government should freeze household energy bills, outlining a Â£29bn plan that would stop the energy price cap going up for all homes. At the time, Ms Truss dismissed the proposal as a ""sticking plaster"". Liz Truss beat Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest The Lib Dems have called for a price cap rise in October - which will take the typical household energy bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 - to be scrapped. It proposed that the cost be covered by a windfall tax on energy company profits. Ms Truss did not rule out a freeze during her Sunday interview with Laura Kuenssberg, but there is still a lack of clarity about how it could be funded. Derek Lickorish, chairman of pay-as-you-go energy supplier Utilita, said he and other industry bosses had been calling for a freeze to the energy price cap ""for some time"". ""We recognise it's going to be very expensive but if we don't the economy is going to crash and consumers won't know what to do, they won't know where to turn to for help,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

"Australian liquor store Dan Murphy's is offering on-the-spot job interviews in 10-minute slots because of a staff shortage ahead of Christmas. During the hiring week from Monday until Sunday, the business aims to take on more than 2,200 casual workers. The country is seeing one of its tightest jobs markets in nearly 50 years with the unemployment rate at a record low of 3.5%. Last week, Australia raised its cap on permanent migration to help fill jobs. Australia raises cap on permanent migration ""We wanted to make it as easy as possible for people who are interested in a career with Dan Murphy's to get a foot in the door,"" according to Dan Murphy's incoming managing director Agi Pfeiffer-Smith. Australia's acute worker shortage - the second-worst after Canada in the OECD group of advanced countries - was caused by the pandemic and Australia's tough border policies have exacerbated staffing gaps across all sectors, including hospitality and retail. The government announced last week it will take up to 195,000 people this financial year - an increase of 35,000 as it tries to fill almost a half a million job vacancies.

"Boris Johnson's successor as UK prime minister will be revealed later when either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is named next Conservative leader. The winner of the leadership contest, tipped by pollsters to be Ms Truss, will be announced at 12:30 BST before entering office on Tuesday. The new PM will inherit a flagging economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and soaring energy bills. Ms Truss has promised to ""act immediately"" to help with energy costs. Unveiling details of a support package will be one of her first acts as prime minister, with an announcement pencilled in for Thursday. Energy industry sources expect the incoming government to freeze energy prices, a possible move not denied by Ms Truss's team. Truss vows energy plan in a week if she becomes PM New PM needs to unify divided Tory party Queen to stay at Balmoral to appoint new PM According to BBC political editor Chris Mason, Ms Truss has been working on her energy package for weeks, based on discussion with oil and gas producers. She also plans to deliver Â£30bn in tax cuts through an emergency Budget later this month, arguing the UK's tax burden is behind sluggish growth. Ms Truss's expected chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, has argued her tax-cutting agenda will boost business investment and economic growth. Writing in the Financial Times,external, he blamed ""economic managerialism"" for years of low growth, adding ""we need to be decisive and do things differently"". Mr Sunak, the former chancellor, criticised her tax-cutting plans during the weeks-long contest, arguing they would jeopardise the public finances. The seven-week leadership contest brings to an end Mr Johnson's turbulent three years in office, and has seen the candidates regularly attack each other's policies as well as the Tories' record in government. Mr Johnson was forced out in July by a ministerial revolt over a string of scandals, just over two-and-a-half years after leading the Tories to a landslide victory at the 2019 election. On his final day in office, Mr Johnson will speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the telephone. He is expected to deliver a farewell speech upon leaving office on Tuesday, before the handover of power takes place. Downing Street also anticipates further resignations from the government, from ministers who do not expect to be part of Liz Truss's administration, Chris Mason says. There aren't many people around Westminster predicting anything other than Liz Truss being named the new prime minister. Even Rishi Sunak's closest allies talk of him not losing by much, rather than winning. If Ms Truss is named the victor just before lunchtime, one issue will define her early weeks in power: the cost of living. She is planning a significant intervention this week, where tens of billions of pounds will be committed to helping with rising bills and inflation. That will include tax cuts and help for families and businesses. Expect her to also talk about an energy strategy to protect the UK against further turbulence in years to come. After weeks of talking to Conservative members, the new prime minister will have to start talking to the country immediately. And the stakes are high, for voters are worried about their bills most of all. But also for the Conservative Party, worried about its future. As one senior Tory put it to me last night: ""If we get energy right, Starmer is beatable. If we don't, we're out."" Ms Truss is yet to offer details of her cost-of-living support plan beyond saying she will temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills and reverse the rise in National Insurance introduced during Mr Johnson's tenure. Mr Sunakannounced paymentsof Â£15bn as chancellor, including Â£400 payments for all households, but both contenders have said further support will be required after cost predictions rose further over the summer. Labour and the SNP have followed the Liberal Democrats in urging the government to freeze energy prices through multi-billion pound subsidies, while the Greens have suggestednationalising the UK's five biggest suppliers. Ms Truss did not rule out a freeze on Sunday, but has previously described Labour's proposals as a ""sticking plaster"" and argues more needs to be done to help the UK boost its domestic sources of energy. She has said any further support would have to go ""hand in hand"" with efforts to boost nuclear energy, fracking for shale gas and more oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC looks back at the two final candidates and their memorable campaign moments The leadership race began in July, when the original field of 11 contenders for the Tory leadership was whittled down to two in a series of Tory MP ballots, with the final pair going into a run-off to be decided by the membership, which stands at about 160,000. Although Mr Sunak had the most support among Tory MPs, he has trailed Ms Truss in opinion polls of the party grassroots. BBC political editor Chris Masonsays that uniting the Conservative party will be one of the new PM's tasks, with one long-standing MP expressing worries that as prime minister, Ms Truss might not reach out to as many Sunak supporters and offer them jobs as might be wise, and that could entrench divisions in the party. In a break with tradition, the next Tory leader willtravel to Balmoral Castle in Scotlandto be appointed by the Queen, rather than at Buckingham Palace. The Queen has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change announced last week was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements.

"A new hierarchy of road-users means a driver in a car, van or lorry has a greater responsibility to watch out for others More than three-fifths of UK motorists have not read recent updates to the Highway Code, according to the AA. The motoring group's survey of 13,327 members suggested 8,090 (61%) drivers had not read changes made in January. Some 6,972 motorists had heard aboutthe new rulesbut had not read them yet, while 1,118 drivers were completely unaware of the changes. The new guidance gives pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders greater priorities on the road. Vehicles should give at least 1.5m (4ft 11in) space when overtaking cyclists, and 2m (6ft 7in) for horses. Drivers and other road users should give way to pedestrians crossing at road junctions, and are not allowed to cut across vulnerable users when exiting a junction. The Highway Code now advises cyclists to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic and when approaching junctions. A hierarchy of road-users was also introduced, meaning a driver in a car, van or lorry now has a greater responsibility to watch out for others. Highway Code: How the update could improve road safety Jersey adopts same changes to Highway Code as UK Highway Code: Watching TV in self-driving cars to be allowed Mary Williams OBE, chief executive of road safety charity Brake, described the changes as ""crucial"" because they ""better protect those most at risk, such as people walking and cycling"". ""Every 22 minutes someone is killed or seriously injured on UK roads,"" she told the BBC, adding ""more must be done"" to promote new guidance so ""all road users understand our shared responsibility to reduce deaths and serious injuries"". Ms Williams also urged ""drivers in particular"" to look at the updated code and ""do their bit to put safety first by looking out for vulnerable road users"". Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns and advocacy at Cycling UK, said the changes are positive for all road users, but particularly those who are ""vulnerable"" such as cyclists. ""Sadly, these changes will be of limited benefit if the public aren't aware of them,"" he told the BBC. ""Due to inaccurate reporting of the new rules when they came into effect, there was initially some confusion"". ""The Department for Transport is now promoting a campaign to communicate the changes, however this really needs to be part of a long-term, well-funded awareness campaign,"" he said, adding that Cycling UK had created anonline toolkit,externalon the new rules. The UK government said the changes would enhance safety for all road users. When asked to pick five correct statements from the new Highway Code from a list of 10, the majority of respondents answered correctly. Tim Rankin, managing director of AA Accident Assist, said the group was ""concerned that so many still haven't read the rules"". He said: ""While we are pleased that many of the changes can be successfully recalled, we'd like more drivers to know the rules outright so they can keep themselves and others safe. ""It is in everyone's interest to take every measure that helps avoid collisions and remove confusion from the road, so we urge those that still haven't read the updated code to do so as soon as possible."" Thechanges to the Highway Code,externalalso state: Drivers and passengers should use the'Dutch Reach' method- opening a car door with the hand furthest away - to ensure they turn their head and look before opening Anyone using an electrical vehicle charging point should park as close to the point as possible, display a warning sign, and return charging cables neatly Cyclists in groups should be considerate of other road users and can ride two abreast Cars and motorbikes should allow cyclists to move across their path when travelling around a roundabout People cycling, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle should respect the safety of walkers, but people walking should also take care not to obstruct them Additional reporting by Sam Hancock and Oliver Slow 'Dutch reach' rule change to Highway Code welcomed Jersey adopts same changes to Highway Code as UK Watching TV to be allowed in self-driving cars Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Israel and Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, sources tell BBC UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

"Liz Truss will be the new UK prime minister after defeating Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest Priti Patel resigns as home secretary, with Attorney General Suella Braverman tipped to replace her It was a closer result than some analysts predicted, with Truss taking 57% of valid votes cast She has pledged to ""deliver"" on the energy crisis and is understood to be considering a freeze on energy bills Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is expected to become chancellor, and Education Secretary James Cleverly foreign secretary Truss will become prime minister on Tuesday after travelling to meet the Queen at Balmoral in Scotland Labour's Keir Starmer has congratulated her but says the country is facing a ""Tory cost of living crisis"" You can watch live BBC News coverage now by clicking at the top of the page Edited by Heather Sharp We're pausing our live page for today. Today's coverage was brought to you by Emily McGarvey, Heather Sharp, Marita Moloney, Jack Burgess, Adam Durbin, Alys Davies, Jeremy Gahagan, Laura Gozzi, Thomas Mackintosh and Nathan Williams. We'll be back tomorrow with live updates as Boris Johnson announces his resignation to the Queen, and the monarch appoints Liz Truss as the new prime minister. We'll shortly be closing our live coverage for today, but here's a recap of the main developments:  You can read the latesthere. As the BBC's Political Editor Chris Masonreports, we can expect Liz Truss's cabinet to include Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, Home Secretary Suella Braverman and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly. While these appointments won't be announced until tomorrow, when Truss formally takes office, here's a quick summary of the trio. Kwasi Kwarteng  Suella Braverman  James Cleverly Help for consumers' energy costs is to be provided by allowing energy suppliers to take out government-backed loans to allow them to subsidise bills. The plan, which had been suggested by the energy industry, is set to be announced on Thursday. The ""deficit reduction scheme"" is expected to form the centrepiece of the government's attempt to tackle the high cost of energy for consumers. Smaller firms are expected to be offered similar help to that of households, although the BBC understands the details of how businesses will be helped may not be ironed out in time to be included in Thursday's energy announcement. It is also understood that bigger companies may be offered bespoke tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices. You can read morehere Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At one stage this summer, Priti Patel considered a leadership bid of her own. At least a dozen colleagues pressed her to do so. But she swithered. And some who would have supported her began to declare for other candidates. She - like the final two in the contest - was one of the most senior members of Boris Johnsonâs government. Insiders suggest she didnât discern any abilities in them that she didnât possess herself. So she endorsed neither of them - a potentially career-limiting move. While she would have been happy to stay at the Home Office, the rumours that Suella Braverman would replace her were solidified by sources close to Liz Truss. At that point, Priti Patel probably decided to jump before she was pushed - though she sent her resignation pointedly to the current prime minister, not his successor. Thus the process of transition in government has begun. And the speculation is whether Sunak supporter Dominic Raab may now follow suit. And now some more reaction from Thetford, a town in Liz Truss' constituency South West Norfolk. Debbie Smith,
39, a lab technician and mother of two currently on maternity leave, says she wants Truss to deal with the cost of energy when she becomes prime minister. âEspecially living in an older house
with the gas, thatâs going to be a killer for us"", says Debbie. ""Weâre going to
have to tighten the belts on everything but weâll get through it, weâll do it,â she says. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The talk of the town here in Belgium isn't the soon-to-be new UK prime minister - although it is being mentioned here and there. It is very much the
energy crisis - especially after theclosure of Nord Stream 1. But if you look at some of the congratulatory words coming
from the European Commission, the message is caveated. Hopes for a constructive relationship are combined with
calls for the UK to ârespectâ or âcomplyâ with Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit treaty, governing trade arrangements for
Northern Ireland, has never been fully implemented. And this year, the UK government worked up plans to
potentially override parts of it altogether - with the architect none other than Liz Truss, as foreign secretary. So Britainâs argument, that problems with the treaty are
baked into the text, isnât likely to change. But one thing to watch for is whether a Truss government
does decide to gives talks with Brussels another whirl. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Energy company bosses met with government ministers today to discuss âtheir partâ in planned interventions by Liz Truss's government. âWe are moving quickly to support the public with the impact of high energy prices, caused by Putinâs weaponisation of energy,"" said a government spokesman. The spokesman said energy company CEOs are clear that they understand the scale of the challenge and the need ""to play their part to ensure the success of the Governmentâs planned intervention"". Mark EastonHome Editor Priti Patelâs letter to Boris Johnson lists what
she regards as her achievements as Home Secretary: more police officers, a
points-based immigration system, asylum reform and her deal with Rwanda. But
whoever takes over at the Home Office will inherit a department with chronic
and profound challenges: David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon wants good relationship with Liz Truss Back within the UK, Liz Truss will be the fourth Conservative
Prime Minister that Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will work
alongside. Speaking to broadcasters this afternoon, the
SNP leader extended an invitation for Truss to come to Edinburgh. Sturgeon said despite political
differences she hoped to work ""constructively"" with the new
Conservative leader. Perhaps comments from earlier in the leadership contest
whenTruss called Sturgeon an ""attention-seeker""can be
swept aside? Sturgeon wants to hold
another independence referendum in the coming months, but Truss opposes the
idea of another vote. Even  so, it's hard to see how the relationship between these two politicians could get much
worse than the one that existed between Sturgeon and Boris Johnson. In her victory speech, Liz Truss said Johnson was ""admired from Kyiv to Carlisle"". Sturgeon
suggested this was an ""honest reflection"" of Johnson's lack of
popularity north of the border. Global leaders have been sending their congratulations to Liz Truss - but in the international media, there have been snarkier remarks, too. ""She has gone to see the Queen,"" saidRussiantelevision presenter Ivan Trushkin. ""If she [the Queen] recognises her of course."" InFrance, meanwhile, she has been branded not the Iron Lady - former UK PM Margaret Thatcher's nickname - but the Iron Weathercock - in reference to Truss's changing views on the UK leaving the European Union. Italy'sCorriere della Sera,externalcompares Truss to Thatcher - but describes the new leader's speeches as more ""robotic"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholzcongratulated Truss,externaland said London and Berlin would carry on cooperating as ""partners and friends"" during ""these challenging times"". Read more here. It's time for a quick recap on what's been a big day for the Conservative Party, and for UK politics. Here are some key things to know: A little more now on reaction to Liz Truss's victory today, and Labour's Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says she needs a plan to tackle soaring inflation and the rising cost of energy. Khan came in for criticism from both candidates as they fought for the leadership. ""If Liz Truss is going to be continuity Boris Johnson, that's a problem for us,"" he tells the BBC. ""We come clearly from different political traditions but we share a common desire to see our capital city and country succeeding. ""She takes over during a time of national crisis. Families, communities and businesses are seeing economic pain they have not seen since the 2008 economic banking crash and even worse than the pandemic,"" he says. ""For the last two months we've see a zombie government and candidates distracted by tribal party politics. ""I've been speaking to parents skipping a meal so their kids can eat, pensioners who have not turned a fan on during the heatwave because they're concerned about their bills. All the time the government missing in action."" In her resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Priti Patel says ""it has been the honour of my life to serve our country as home secretary for the last three years and to deliver on our commitments to back and reform our police, stand up for the hard-working law-abiding majority, reform our immigration and asylum system, and fight terrorism"". ""Your support over this period has delivered an unparalleled package of reforms and investment."" Speaking about policies on migration and slavery, including the Rwanda asylum scheme, Patel said: ""As we know, there is no single solution to this huge challenge and the Government must tackle the full spectrum of issues to halt the illegal entry of migrants to the UK."" ""I congratulate Liz Truss on being elected our new leader, and will give her my support as our new prime minister."" She continues: ""It is my choice to continue my public service to the country and the Witham constituency from the backbenchers, once Liz formally assumes office and a new home secretary is appointed."" ""From the backbenches, I will champion many of the policies I have stood up for both inside and outside government."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she is resigning as Home Secretary. In a letter to Boris Johnson, Patel says it is ""my choice"" to serve from the backbenches. She adds that it is ""vital"" that Liz Truss backs ""all aspects"" of her policies to tackle illegal immigration. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC reporters were out and about in Redcar, North Yorkshire this morning - one of the so-called Red Wall constituencies that switched from Labour to the Conservatives in the 2019 election. They asked people what they think Liz Truss should do when she becomes prime minister. Paul Wigham, 65 â retired Paul Wigham, who is retired, says: ""Hoping, desperately
hoping for some help, for the young âuns, for people whose electricity power and
gas prices have just got ridiculous. Iâm expecting some very serious actions."" Judy Sharples, 59 â works in a residential home for profoundly deaf and disabled people Judy Sharples works in a residential home for profoundly deaf and disabled people. She says she wants to be able to live comfortably and not struggle to pay bills. ""Weâre going to end up
sitting in blankets like they did in the 50s and 40s,"" she says. ""Itâs not on... I donât think anybody
can sort it out unless they all start working together."" Christopher Carter, 36 â works in retail Retail worker Christopher Carter says he wants honesty from the government about why energy prices are ""going through the roof"". He believes it's because the government has failed to provide alternative energy sources. ""Theyâve been in
charge for 12 years. Theyâve done nothing
with nuclear, theyâve pulled back the solar benefit, they pulled back wind and
the planning permissions,"" he says. Rhona Skelton, 91 (L) and Angela Bennett, 58 - support worker Rhona, aged 91, thinks Liz Truss will do a good job: ""Iâm sure she will but
thereâs a terrible mess everywhere."" Angela says Truss needs to sort out the energy crisis because it affects low-paid workers, like herself. ""I havenât got much
confidence,"" she says, ""they say theyâre
going to do one thing and then U-turn and do something else"". In a blow to both the outgoing and incoming prime minister, it looks set torain on and off for much of tomorrow in Westminster. This may put a dampener on the speeches due to be held outside Downing Street, but it's unclear if it will affect the plans for Boris Johnson and Liz Truss to travel to the Scottish Highlands to see the Queen. With the weather not looking much better in Balmoral, it could affect the timing of Johnson's speech in the morning, as well as force Truss inside for her first address to the nation in the afternoon. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered congratulations to Liz Truss and said France is ""ready to work together as allies and friends"" . Speaking during a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Macron said both France and the UK ""have the same values, a history of friendship, we face common challenges"". It comes after Truss'controversial remarks about the French leader, when she said the ""jury is out"" in response to a question whether he is is a ""friend or foe"" of the UK. Following the remarks, Macronwarned of ""serious problems"" for France-UK relations, but insisted the UK remained an ally despite the occasional error made by its leaders. The UK is a great country committed with us to defend the values of democracy alongside Ukraine and which also needs to strengthen its energy sovereignty and win the battle against climate change."" French President Emmanuel Macron Rishi Sunak says he intends to continue as the MP for Richmond. The defeated Conservative leadership candidate has told the BBC he will contest the seat at the next general election.Asked about higher political ambitions, he said it has been a privilege to serve as chancellor, and that he will now be focused on supporting his constituents and giving Liz Truss his ""full support"". This video can not be played Rishi Sunak plans to stay on as MP and will stand again Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With Liz Truss's victory still fresh, there is a desire amongst some of her critics to avoid being accused of devouring sour grapes, so they have been publicly circumspect in their reaction. But concerns privately about her ability to unite a divided party persist. One former cabinet minister, tongue firmly in cheek, said he was sure ""she will be a complete triumph"" before adding that there was ""precious little sign of her reaching out"" to internal sceptics. ""We can only live in hope,"" he said, but mooted senior appointments appear to be confined overwhelmingly to allies. Another former minister went as far as warning that if ""divisions persist"" she could follow Boris Johnson out of the No 10 door before the next election. Bear in mind she hasn't yet crossed the threshold as PM yet. Â© 2025 BBC.

While these appointments won't be announced until tomorrow, when Truss formally takes office, here's a quick summary of the trio. Kwasi Kwarteng  Suella Braverman  James Cleverly Help for consumers' energy costs is to be provided by allowing energy suppliers to take out government-backed loans to allow them to subsidise bills. The plan, which had been suggested by the energy industry, is set to be announced on Thursday. The ""deficit reduction scheme"" is expected to form the centrepiece of the government's attempt to tackle the high cost of energy for consumers. Smaller firms are expected to be offered similar help to that of households, although the BBC understands the details of how businesses will be helped may not be ironed out in time to be included in Thursday's energy announcement. It is also understood that bigger companies may be offered bespoke tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices.

But she swithered. And some who would have supported her began to declare for other candidates. She - like the final two in the contest - was one of the most senior members of Boris Johnsonâs government. Insiders suggest she didnât discern any abilities in them that she didnât possess herself. So she endorsed neither of them - a potentially career-limiting move. While she would have been happy to stay at the Home Office, the rumours that Suella Braverman would replace her were solidified by sources close to Liz Truss. At that point, Priti Patel probably decided to jump before she was pushed - though she sent her resignation pointedly to the current prime minister, not his successor. Thus the process of transition in government has begun. And the speculation is whether Sunak supporter Dominic Raab may now follow suit. And now some more reaction from Thetford, a town in Liz Truss' constituency South West Norfolk. Debbie Smith,
39, a lab technician and mother of two currently on maternity leave, says she wants Truss to deal with the cost of energy when she becomes prime minister. âEspecially living in an older house
with the gas, thatâs going to be a killer for us"", says Debbie. ""Weâre going to
have to tighten the belts on everything but weâll get through it, weâll do it,â she says. Jessica ParkerReporting from Brussels The talk of the town here in Belgium isn't the soon-to-be new UK prime minister - although it is being mentioned here and there. It is very much the
energy crisis - especially after theclosure of Nord Stream 1. But if you look at some of the congratulatory words coming
from the European Commission, the message is caveated. Hopes for a constructive relationship are combined with
calls for the UK to ârespectâ or âcomplyâ with Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit treaty, governing trade arrangements for
Northern Ireland, has never been fully implemented. And this year, the UK government worked up plans to
potentially override parts of it altogether - with the architect none other than Liz Truss, as foreign secretary. So Britainâs argument, that problems with the treaty are
baked into the text, isnât likely to change. But one thing to watch for is whether a Truss government
does decide to gives talks with Brussels another whirl. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Energy company bosses met with government ministers today to discuss âtheir partâ in planned interventions by Liz Truss's government. âWe are moving quickly to support the public with the impact of high energy prices, caused by Putinâs weaponisation of energy,"" said a government spokesman. The spokesman said energy company CEOs are clear that they understand the scale of the challenge and the need ""to play their part to ensure the success of the Governmentâs planned intervention"". Mark EastonHome Editor Priti Patelâs letter to Boris Johnson lists what
she regards as her achievements as Home Secretary: more police officers, a
points-based immigration system, asylum reform and her deal with Rwanda. But
whoever takes over at the Home Office will inherit a department with chronic
and profound challenges: David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon wants good relationship with Liz Truss Back within the UK, Liz Truss will be the fourth Conservative
Prime Minister that Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will work
alongside. Speaking to broadcasters this afternoon, the
SNP leader extended an invitation for Truss to come to Edinburgh. Sturgeon said despite political
differences she hoped to work ""constructively"" with the new
Conservative leader. Perhaps comments from earlier in the leadership contest
whenTruss called Sturgeon an ""attention-seeker""can be
swept aside? Sturgeon wants to hold
another independence referendum in the coming months, but Truss opposes the
idea of another vote. Even  so, it's hard to see how the relationship between these two politicians could get much
worse than the one that existed between Sturgeon and Boris Johnson. In her victory speech, Liz Truss said Johnson was ""admired from Kyiv to Carlisle"". Sturgeon
suggested this was an ""honest reflection"" of Johnson's lack of
popularity north of the border. Global leaders have been sending their congratulations to Liz Truss - but in the international media, there have been snarkier remarks, too. ""She has gone to see the Queen,"" saidRussiantelevision presenter Ivan Trushkin. ""If she [the Queen] recognises her of course."" InFrance, meanwhile, she has been branded not the Iron Lady - former UK PM Margaret Thatcher's nickname - but the Iron Weathercock - in reference to Truss's changing views on the UK leaving the European Union. Italy'sCorriere della Sera,externalcompares Truss to Thatcher - but describes the new leader's speeches as more ""robotic"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholzcongratulated Truss,externaland said London and Berlin would carry on cooperating as ""partners and friends"" during ""these challenging times"". Read more here. It's time for a quick recap on what's been a big day for the Conservative Party, and for UK politics. Here are some key things to know: A little more now on reaction to Liz Truss's victory today, and Labour's Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says she needs a plan to tackle soaring inflation and the rising cost of energy. Khan came in for criticism from both candidates as they fought for the leadership. ""If Liz Truss is going to be continuity Boris Johnson, that's a problem for us,"" he tells the BBC. ""We come clearly from different political traditions but we share a common desire to see our capital city and country succeeding. ""She takes over during a time of national crisis. Families, communities and businesses are seeing economic pain they have not seen since the 2008 economic banking crash and even worse than the pandemic,"" he says. ""For the last two months we've see a zombie government and candidates distracted by tribal party politics. ""I've been speaking to parents skipping a meal so their kids can eat, pensioners who have not turned a fan on during the heatwave because they're concerned about their bills. All the time the government missing in action."" In her resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Priti Patel says ""it has been the honour of my life to serve our country as home secretary for the last three years and to deliver on our commitments to back and reform our police, stand up for the hard-working law-abiding majority, reform our immigration and asylum system, and fight terrorism"". ""Your support over this period has delivered an unparalleled package of reforms and investment."" Speaking about policies on migration and slavery, including the Rwanda asylum scheme, Patel said: ""As we know, there is no single solution to this huge challenge and the Government must tackle the full spectrum of issues to halt the illegal entry of migrants to the UK."" ""I congratulate Liz Truss on being elected our new leader, and will give her my support as our new prime minister."" She continues: ""It is my choice to continue my public service to the country and the Witham constituency from the backbenchers, once Liz formally assumes office and a new home secretary is appointed."" ""From the backbenches, I will champion many of the policies I have stood up for both inside and outside government."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has said she is resigning as Home Secretary. In a letter to Boris Johnson, Patel says it is ""my choice"" to serve from the backbenches. She adds that it is ""vital"" that Liz Truss backs ""all aspects"" of her policies to tackle illegal immigration. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC reporters were out and about in Redcar, North Yorkshire this morning - one of the so-called Red Wall constituencies that switched from Labour to the Conservatives in the 2019 election. They asked people what they think Liz Truss should do when she becomes prime minister. Paul Wigham, 65 â retired Paul Wigham, who is retired, says: ""Hoping, desperately
hoping for some help, for the young âuns, for people whose electricity power and
gas prices have just got ridiculous. Iâm expecting some very serious actions."" Judy Sharples, 59 â works in a residential home for profoundly deaf and disabled people Judy Sharples works in a residential home for profoundly deaf and disabled people. She says she wants to be able to live comfortably and not struggle to pay bills. ""Weâre going to end up
sitting in blankets like they did in the 50s and 40s,"" she says. ""Itâs not on... I donât think anybody
can sort it out unless they all start working together."" Christopher Carter, 36 â works in retail Retail worker Christopher Carter says he wants honesty from the government about why energy prices are ""going through the roof"". He believes it's because the government has failed to provide alternative energy sources. ""Theyâve been in
charge for 12 years. Theyâve done nothing
with nuclear, theyâve pulled back the solar benefit, they pulled back wind and
the planning permissions,"" he says. Rhona Skelton, 91 (L) and Angela Bennett, 58 - support worker Rhona, aged 91, thinks Liz Truss will do a good job: ""Iâm sure she will but
thereâs a terrible mess everywhere."" Angela says Truss needs to sort out the energy crisis because it affects low-paid workers, like herself. ""I havenât got much
confidence,"" she says, ""they say theyâre
going to do one thing and then U-turn and do something else"". In a blow to both the outgoing and incoming prime minister, it looks set torain on and off for much of tomorrow in Westminster. This may put a dampener on the speeches due to be held outside Downing Street, but it's unclear if it will affect the plans for Boris Johnson and Liz Truss to travel to the Scottish Highlands to see the Queen. With the weather not looking much better in Balmoral, it could affect the timing of Johnson's speech in the morning, as well as force Truss inside for her first address to the nation in the afternoon. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered congratulations to Liz Truss and said France is ""ready to work together as allies and friends"" . Speaking during a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Macron said both France and the UK ""have the same values, a history of friendship, we face common challenges"". It comes after Truss'controversial remarks about the French leader, when she said the ""jury is out"" in response to a question whether he is is a ""friend or foe"" of the UK. Following the remarks, Macronwarned of ""serious problems"" for France-UK relations, but insisted the UK remained an ally despite the occasional error made by its leaders. The UK is a great country committed with us to defend the values of democracy alongside Ukraine and which also needs to strengthen its energy sovereignty and win the battle against climate change."" French President Emmanuel Macron Rishi Sunak says he intends to continue as the MP for Richmond. The defeated Conservative leadership candidate has told the BBC he will contest the seat at the next general election.Asked about higher political ambitions, he said it has been a privilege to serve as chancellor, and that he will now be focused on supporting his constituents and giving Liz Truss his ""full support"". This video can not be played Rishi Sunak plans to stay on as MP and will stand again Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With Liz Truss's victory still fresh, there is a desire amongst some of her critics to avoid being accused of devouring sour grapes, so they have been publicly circumspect in their reaction. But concerns privately about her ability to unite a divided party persist. One former cabinet minister, tongue firmly in cheek, said he was sure ""she will be a complete triumph"" before adding that there was ""precious little sign of her reaching out"" to internal sceptics. ""We can only live in hope,"" he said, but mooted senior appointments appear to be confined overwhelmingly to allies. Another former minister went as far as warning that if ""divisions persist"" she could follow Boris Johnson out of the No 10 door before the next election. Bear in mind she hasn't yet crossed the threshold as PM yet. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"Barristers in England and Wales are starting an indefinite, uninterrupted strike, in an escalation of industrial action over pay which began in April. The Criminal Bar Association (CBA) walkout is likely to worsen existing court delays, with tens of thousands of cases already waiting to go to trial. The CBA wants a 25% rise in legal aid fees for representing defendants who could not otherwise afford lawyers. Justice Minister Sarah Dines has called the escalation ""irresponsible"". But Kirsty Brimelow, who chairs the CBA, says it is an attempt to ""hold up the criminal justice system from complete collapse"". Criminal barristers vote to go on all-out strike Victim's father backs barristers' strike action Barrister's pay prompts move back in with parents Although the all-out strike formally starts on Monday, members of the CBA have staged intermittent walkouts since the end of June, escalating to week-long strikes on alternate weeks throughout August. Barristers will hold a series of rallies in support of the strike on Tuesday, gathering outside the Supreme Court in London and at court buildings in Cardiff, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Leeds. At least 7,000 criminal cases go to Crown Court judges every month. So it's plain to see that if barristers strike, the historically high backlog and delays will grow. Just over a week ago, a judge at the Old Bailey warned that serious trials for murder could be postponed for a year if they don't start on time due to the strike. Elsewhere, there are murder trials due to start or continue in Northampton and Luton, to pick just two locations. Ministers say the strike is irresponsible - but criminal barristers respond that they're the ones really concerned about the health of justice. Figures show that their numbers are reducing year-on-year - and that can be seen in the statistics. In the first three months of this year, 370 scheduled trials, for which victims, defendants and witnesses had prepared, were put off because of a shortage of prosecution and defence lawyers - and 48 because of a lack of judges. The government has offered a 15% rise from the end of September, which the CBA has rejected, saying it would not kick in soon enough or apply to existing cases. It says the criminal justice system has been run down by years of underfunding, with some junior barristers making less than the hourly minimum wage and more than a quarter having quit the profession in the past five years. ""Barristers have stopped soldiering on through downtrodden courts,"" said Ms Brimelow, who called for ""proper investment in barristers who deliver the justice"". ""This is not a 'world-class justice system', as set out as the vision of the Ministry of Justice. It is not even a functioning justice system,"" she added. At the end of June the courts backlog in England and Wales stood at 58,973 cases, having almost doubled since 2019. According to Ministry of Justice figures, 6,235 court hearings were disrupted by the strikes between 27 June and 5 August, including 1,415 trials. The Ministry of Justice rejects applying the fee rise to existing cases, saying it would ""cost a disproportionate amount of taxpayers' money"". Ministers say a typical criminal barrister would earn Â£7,000 more a year under the offer, adding that before expenses, median earnings for criminal barristers in 2019-20 were Â£79,800, although it admits junior barristers often earn a fraction of this. Ms Dines reiterated the government's view that the move to an all-out strike ""is an irresponsible decision that will only see more victims face further delays and distress"".

"New Prime Minister Liz Truss used her victory speech to pledge to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills as well as supplies. A freeze on energy bills is understood to be one of a number of options being worked on to help struggling households to cope with soaring costs. It is expected that energy suppliers will be able to take out government-backed loans to subsidise bills. Energy bosses have been meeting with government officials on the matter. A Â£100bn plan to freeze household bills was proposed by energy companies last month. Under the proposal, bills would be subsidised and the current price cap of Â£1,971 for a typical family would be maintained for two years. The BBC understands that a similar scheme will be used to limit the energy price increases being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses.

Speaking after the announcement, she said: ""I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people's energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply."" In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""There can be no justification for not freezing energy prices. ""There's a political consensus that needs to happen. She needs to ask the question, how she's going to pay for that? Labour made it clear, it needs to be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies.""

Mr Kwarteng - tipped to be named chancellor by Ms Truss - suggested he would look at the UK's rules on government borrowing and spending - called fiscal rules - to see if they still worked for the economy.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the National Insurance cut would be of greater benefit to higher earners rather than those on lower income. During an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ms Truss said it was fair to givehigher earners more money back through tax cuts.and recent Tory policy had failed to grow the economy. A plan to freeze energy bills for households is striking in its simplicity for those facing a tough winter - until you start considering how it can be funded, and other details. It is likely to ultimately cost billions of pounds, and that may need to be paid back either through you paying extra on bills for the next decade, or through taxation if the government picks up the tab, or through extra borrowing. They would seem to be main options, given Liz Truss has been clear that she is not keen on a windfall tax on energy companies' profits. And, remember, the price cap only covers domestic bills in England, Wales, and Scotland. Will there be anything similar for billpayers in Northern Ireland who have also seen the cost of heating and lighting homes rise? What about small businesses, who are also seeing bills surge? We should not expect answers yet. We should wait for a policy announcement first. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said ""simply cutting taxes, cutting National Insurance contributions for example, is not a strategy for growth"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme these measures would come on top of the billions the government would have to spend to help with energy bills. ""We'll have not just extremely high borrowing in the short run but also additional inflationary pressure,"" he said. Last month, Labour said the government should freeze household energy bills, outlining a Â£29bn plan that would stop the energy price cap going up for all homes. At the time, Ms Truss dismissed the proposal as a ""sticking plaster"". Liz Truss beat Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest The Lib Dems have called for a price cap rise in October - which will take the typical household energy bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 - to be scrapped.

"New Prime Minister Liz Truss used her victory speech to pledge to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills as well as supplies. A freeze on energy bills is understood to be one of a number of options being worked on to help struggling households to cope with soaring costs. It is expected that energy suppliers will be able to take out government-backed loans to subsidise bills. Energy bosses have been meeting with government officials on the matter. A Â£100bn plan to freeze household bills was proposed by energy companies last month. Under the proposal, bills would be subsidised and the current price cap of Â£1,971 for a typical family would be maintained for two years. The BBC understands that a similar scheme will be used to limit the energy price increases being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses. And bigger companies may be offered tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices. Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of party member votes to become the new Conservative leader.

"The soaring cost of living is one of the big issues facing the new prime minister Liz Truss, the UK's next prime minister, will arrive in Downing Street to an overflowing in-tray of potential problems - an all-consuming cost of living crisis, dire warnings about the state of the NHS, and an ongoing war in Ukraine. Seven BBC correspondents identified some of the biggest questions No 10's latest occupant will have to tackle. Faisal Islam, economics editor The new prime minister won't actually be able to solve fully their biggest challenge - the cost-of-living crisis. And it's got notably worse during the leadership campaign. At its core is the problem that energy, especially gas, is not flowing normally. This is primarily because of the Ukraine conflict and the conscious actions of the Kremlin. Prices spiked further recently, as European nations stored up gas for the winter. The overall result is energy prices most people will find unaffordable. The extent, timing, and targeting of help - which will stretch into tens of billions of pounds just for households - are the key judgements the new prime minister will face. Other prices - especially for food - are also surging, which could lead the inflation rate beyond 15%. All that is before the impact of further falls in the value of Sterling. Meanwhile, interest rates are on the rise, not just for families, but also for companies and the government itself. It is a toxic economic cocktail, and will require judicious, credible, and timely interventions. What do Covid, Ukraine and droughts have to do with my bills? Nick Triggle, health correspondent NHS workers have threatened to strike over pay, as the cost of living crisis follows the pandemic NHS performance has been deteriorating for the best part of a decade, but the pandemic has exacerbated its problems even further. Record numbers are on hospital waiting lists - nearly one in eight people are currently waiting for treatment. Meanwhile, emergency services are warning patients are being harmed because of delays responding to 999 calls and long waits in A&E. There is the threat of industrial action, with unions unhappy with pay. And all this is happening ahead of winter, with the prospect of flu and Covid circulating at high levels for the first time. Part of the problem hospitals are facing is the inability to discharge patients when they are medically fit to leave because of a lack of social care places. The government does have a plan for social care - the care cap - but that is about protecting people's assets rather than providing more funding for services. Even then, there has been debate about whether the government is right to increase national insurance to pay for it, in part because of rising inflation. Fixing the NHS - a near impossible job for new PM? James Landale, diplomatic correspondent Boris Johnson offered Ukraine early political and military support. The new prime minister is expected to maintain that approach and is likely to be willing to provide Ukraine with more weapons as the conflict progresses. But as time goes by, the new prime minister may face a growing challenge of convincing doubters at home and abroad that the economic price of supporting Ukraine is worth it. With rising energy costs exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis, the PM will have to persuade voters that their financial discomfort is needed to defend Ukraine. There will also be a big job of diplomacy to protect the pro-Ukraine alliance across Europe. There may well be countries that want to seek an accommodation with Russia and end the fighting to help secure their energy supplies. As UK counts pennies, we count casualties - Zelenska Ione Wells, political correspondent After months of infighting, uniting the Conservative party is the main political challenge. And party unity will face an early test: the privileges committee investigation into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over Downing Street parties. If the committee of MPs recommends a punishment for Mr Johnson, MPs will need to vote on it. The prime minister will have to decide whether to let Tories vote how they want, or whether to instruct them to vote a certain way. Whipping them to vote for a sanction could anger those who support Boris Johnson, but the opposite approach risks accusations of trying to cover up wrongdoing. Why does Tory infighting matter when there are pressing concerns, like the cost of living? Firstly, because governments with divided parties can struggle to pass policies that matter to people's lives. Secondly, it can be hard - as Mr Johnson discovered - to land your messages with the public if ministers spend more time on the airwaves trying to defend various behavioural issues, rather than policies. Boris Johnson's track record as PM Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political correspondent The next PM will quickly face a conundrum over the Northern Ireland protocol. Talks with the EU all but ground to a halt after the government introduced a bill to give UK ministers powers to override parts of the post-Brexit trading arrangements. The Democratic Unionist Party declared it won't form a power-sharing government at Stormont until the protocol is changed, arguing it damages Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The key date is 28 October, the deadline for restoring government at Stormont. After that date, the government will either have to call a fresh assembly election, draw up legislation for a new deadline, or begin taking more decisions for Northern Ireland from Westminster. The PM will also have to bear in mind that most Northern Irish politicians want the protocol to remain and won't shy from laying blame at the door of Downing Street. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland News political editor Nicola Sturgeon is proposing to hold a second independence referendum in October 2023 Theresa May made the trip to Scotland on her first full day in office. Boris Johnson arranged his meeting within a week. It's not clear whether the new prime minister will be in quite the same hurry to go at a time when Nicola Sturgeon is pressing for an agreement to hold another independence referendum, in 2023. In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it. In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further. Is indyref2 showdown Nicola Sturgeon's last stand? Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind. Both are currently stymied by the planning process. Could that be simplified to speed up the transition to renewables? Early indications are that the answer will be no. Can the UK afford its net zero policies? Queen to stay at Balmoral to appoint new PM What does the prime minister do? Johnson on his legacy as PM: Only time will tell.

"Boris Johnson's successor as UK prime minister will be revealed later when either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is named next Conservative leader. The winner of the leadership contest, tipped by pollsters to be Ms Truss, will be announced at 12:30 BST before entering office on Tuesday. The new PM will inherit a flagging economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and soaring energy bills. Ms Truss has promised to ""act immediately"" to help with energy costs. Unveiling details of a support package will be one of her first acts as prime minister, with an announcement pencilled in for Thursday. Energy industry sources expect the incoming government to freeze energy prices, a possible move not denied by Ms Truss's team. Truss vows energy plan in a week if she becomes PM New PM needs to unify divided Tory party Queen to stay at Balmoral to appoint new PM According to BBC political editor Chris Mason, Ms Truss has been working on her energy package for weeks, based on discussion with oil and gas producers. She also plans to deliver Â£30bn in tax cuts through an emergency Budget later this month, arguing the UK's tax burden is behind sluggish growth. Ms Truss's expected chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, has argued her tax-cutting agenda will boost business investment and economic growth. Writing in the Financial Times,external, he blamed ""economic managerialism"" for years of low growth, adding ""we need to be decisive and do things differently"". Mr Sunak, the former chancellor, criticised her tax-cutting plans during the weeks-long contest, arguing they would jeopardise the public finances. The seven-week leadership contest brings to an end Mr Johnson's turbulent three years in office, and has seen the candidates regularly attack each other's policies as well as the Tories' record in government. Mr Johnson was forced out in July by a ministerial revolt over a string of scandals, just over two-and-a-half years after leading the Tories to a landslide victory at the 2019 election. On his final day in office, Mr Johnson will speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the telephone. He is expected to deliver a farewell speech upon leaving office on Tuesday, before the handover of power takes place. Downing Street also anticipates further resignations from the government, from ministers who do not expect to be part of Liz Truss's administration, Chris Mason says. There aren't many people around Westminster predicting anything other than Liz Truss being named the new prime minister. Even Rishi Sunak's closest allies talk of him not losing by much, rather than winning. If Ms Truss is named the victor just before lunchtime, one issue will define her early weeks in power: the cost of living. She is planning a significant intervention this week, where tens of billions of pounds will be committed to helping with rising bills and inflation. That will include tax cuts and help for families and businesses. Expect her to also talk about an energy strategy to protect the UK against further turbulence in years to come. After weeks of talking to Conservative members, the new prime minister will have to start talking to the country immediately. And the stakes are high, for voters are worried about their bills most of all. But also for the Conservative Party, worried about its future. As one senior Tory put it to me last night: ""If we get energy right, Starmer is beatable. If we don't, we're out."" Ms Truss is yet to offer details of her cost-of-living support plan beyond saying she will temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills and reverse the rise in National Insurance introduced during Mr Johnson's tenure. Mr Sunakannounced paymentsof Â£15bn as chancellor, including Â£400 payments for all households, but both contenders have said further support will be required after cost predictions rose further over the summer. Labour and the SNP have followed the Liberal Democrats in urging the government to freeze energy prices through multi-billion pound subsidies, while the Greens have suggestednationalising the UK's five biggest suppliers. Ms Truss did not rule out a freeze on Sunday, but has previously described Labour's proposals as a ""sticking plaster"" and argues more needs to be done to help the UK boost its domestic sources of energy. She has said any further support would have to go ""hand in hand"" with efforts to boost nuclear energy, fracking for shale gas and more oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC looks back at the two final candidates and their memorable campaign moments The leadership race began in July, when the original field of 11 contenders for the Tory leadership was whittled down to two in a series of Tory MP ballots, with the final pair going into a run-off to be decided by the membership, which stands at about 160,000. Although Mr Sunak had the most support among Tory MPs, he has trailed Ms Truss in opinion polls of the party grassroots. BBC political editor Chris Masonsays that uniting the Conservative party will be one of the new PM's tasks, with one long-standing MP expressing worries that as prime minister, Ms Truss might not reach out to as many Sunak supporters and offer them jobs as might be wise, and that could entrench divisions in the party. In a break with tradition, the next Tory leader willtravel to Balmoral Castle in Scotlandto be appointed by the Queen, rather than at Buckingham Palace. The Queen has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change announced last week was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements.

In October, the UK Supreme Court will be asked to consider whether or not Holyrood has the power to hold IndyRef2 without Westminster's consent. The weight of legal opinion suggests the answer may be no but if the case goes the other way, the PM would face a big call: allow the vote to go ahead or take active steps to stop it. In resisting Scottish independence, any prime minister must be careful not to choose an approach that risks undermining support for the union further. Is indyref2 showdown Nicola Sturgeon's last stand? Jonah Fisher, BBC environment correspondent In the midst of a gas price crisis, the new prime minister will very rapidly have to make decisions on energy that could set us on course to make, or break, the UK's commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Will they prioritise the push for more renewables against the demands from some that they look again at the fossil fuels that already warm our planet? Should new oil and gas projects be greenlighted in the North Sea? Will the new leader give any encouragement to the UK fracking industry? As part of the net zero strategy, the government has committed to decarbonise the generation of electricity by 2035. For that to happen there will need to be a massive expansion in renewable energy. Offshore wind is already a British success story, but the fastest renewable projects from conception to completion are on land - solar and onshore wind. Both are currently stymied by the planning process. Could that be simplified to speed up the transition to renewables? Early indications are that the answer will be no.
