"Singer Lizzo performed in New York's Central Park for Global Citizen Live Ed Sheeran, Lizzo and Billie Eilish were among stars to take part in a 24-hour gig to raise awareness of climate change, vaccine inequality and famine. Over 60 artists performed in The Global Citizen festival in cities including New York, London and Seoul. Tens of thousands of people attended concerts around the world, and millions more tuned in to the broadcast. The event kicked off on Saturday in Paris, where Elton John performed in front of the Eiffel Tower. He took to the stage following a pre-recorded performance by the K-pop band BTS. Elton John performed in Paris alongside US artist Charlie Puth The show, believed to be one of the biggest-ever international charity events, was organised by Global Citizen - a charity working to end extreme poverty by 2030. Unlike most events of this nature, organisers were not aiming to raise cash, but to use participation as evidence for world leaders that people support bold action on the issues. ""Across six continents, artists will help rally citizens in demanding that governments, major corporations and philanthropists work together to defend the planet and defeat poverty,"" Global Citizen said in a statement. Taboo, will.i.am and J. Rey Soul of the Black Eyed Peas took to the stage in Paris It called on international governments to plant one billion trees, deliver one billion vaccines to the poorest countries and donate meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine. Billie Eilish performed in New York Jennifer Lopez was among those who performed in New York, along with Billie Eilish and Coldplay. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle called for the Covid-19 vaccine to be treated as a basic human right Earlier, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, took to the stage calling for access to Covid-19 vaccines to be treated ""as a basic human right."" ""The way you're born should not dictate your ability to survive,"" the Duke of Sussex told crowds in the city's Central Park. They were followed performances by singer Alessia Cara and pop veteran Cyndi Lauper, who sang a rendition of Girls Just Want To Have Fun, dedicated to Afghan women. Thousands of people filled The Great Lawn in New York's Central Park for a concert in the city Ed Sheeran performed in Paris alongside the Black Eyed Peas and Stormzy, while Stevie Wonder played in Los Angeles. There were also pre-recorded performances from a huge number of stars, including Green Day, Kylie Minogue and Andrea Bocelli. Funding announcements poured in between sets. In a recorded message, USAID Administrator Samantha Power announced that the US would contribute more than $295m (Â£215m) ""to stave off famine and extreme hunger, confront gender-based violence and address the urgent humanitarian needs the Covid-19 pandemic is leaving in its wake."" Kylie Minogue is one of many stars to have pre-recorded a performance French President Emmanuel Macron also pledged to double the number of coronavirus vaccines his country will send to poorer nations, to 120 million. Meanwhile, a host of international companies like Lego, Cisco and Verizon promised charitable donations. The head of the World Health Organization has backed Saturday's concerts, calling on the leaders of the developed world to unite and bring an end to vaccine inequality. ""We now face a two-track pandemic of haves and have-nots,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""We cannot disregard this gross inequity or become complacent."" Grime star Stormzy also took to the stage in the French capital Those attending the concerts were required to produce either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test. Tickets to the shows were distributed free of charge to randomly selected people who signed up for the Global Citizen app and shared its petitions on social media. The Global Citizen organisation has been behind other high-profile charity events, including Vax Live: The Concert To Reunite The World earlier this year in Los Angeles. That event brought together musicians, actors, celebrities and world leaders in a united call for global vaccinations to fight Covid-19.

"Ms Meng, pictured on arrival in China, had been accused of fraud by US prosecutors A Chinese tech executive released after being detained in Canada for nearly three years has returned home. Huawei's Meng Wanzhou flew to Shenzhen on Saturday evening, hours after two Canadians freed by China had gone back. In 2018 China accused Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig of espionage, denying detaining them was in retaliation for Ms Meng's arrest. The apparent swap brings to an end a damaging diplomatic row between Beijing and the West. Mr Spavor and Mr Kovrig arrived in the western city of Calgary just before 06:00 local time (12:00 GMT) and were met by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A couple of hours later Ms Meng touched down in Shenzhen, China, to applauds from a crowd gathered at the airport. ""I'm finally back home!,"" said Ms Meng, according to the Global Times, a Chinese tabloid backed by the ruling Communist Party. ""Where there is a Chinese flag, there is a beacon of faith,"" she added. ""If faith has a colour, it must be China red."" Ms Meng was wanted on charges in the US but was released after a deal between Canada and US prosecutors. Michael Kovrig (r) and Michael Spavor had been held since 2018 Before her release, Ms Meng admitted misleading US investigators about Huawei's business dealings in Iran. She spent three years under house arrest in Canada while fighting extradition to the United States. China had earlier insisted that her case was not related to the sudden arrest of Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor in 2018. But China's the decision to free them after Ms Meng's release appears to show that pretence has been abandoned, reports Robin Brant, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent. Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor have maintained their innocence throughout, and critics have accused China of using them as political bargaining chips. After they arrived in Calgary,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shared images,externalon Twitter of him welcoming the pair. ""You've shown incredible strength, resilience, and perseverance,"" he wrote in the tweet. ""Know that Canadians across the country will continue to be here for you, just as they have been."" The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Mr Kovrig is a former diplomat employed by International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. Mr Spavor is a founding member of an organisation that facilitates international business and cultural ties with North Korea. In August this year a Chinese court sentenced Mr Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage. There had been no decision in Mr Kovrig's case. On Friday, a Canadian judge ordered the release of Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, after she reached a deal with US prosecutors over fraud charges against her. Huawei said in a statement that it would continue to defend itself in court, and looked forward to seeing Ms Meng reunited with her family. This video can not be played ""My life has been turned upside down,"" Ms Meng tells reporters after being freed from Canadian detention Before her arrest, US prosecutors accused Ms Meng of fraud, alleging that she misled banks into processing transactions for Huawei that broke US sanctions against Iran. As part of a deferred prosecution agreement, Ms Meng admitted to misleading HSBC about Huawei's relationship with Skycom, a Hong-Kong based company that operated in Iran. China's foreign ministry said the charges against her had been ""fabricated"" to suppress the country's high-tech industries, according to state media. But in a statement the US justice department insisted it would continue to prepare for trial against Huawei, which is still on a trade blacklist. Ms Meng is the elder daughter of Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. He also served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei itself is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. It has faced accusations that Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban.

"Joshua looked one-paced with Usyk more often the aggressor Oleksandr Usyk is the new unified heavyweight world champion after dethroning Anthony Joshua with an incredible performance in London. The Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 65,000 fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, outclassing Joshua over 12 rounds, and hurting the defending champion on numerous occasions. The scorecards - 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 - were all for Usyk and there was a mere shrug of the shoulders from Joshua as the second defeat of his professional career was confirmed. Having seen a fight with fellow Briton Tyson Fury collapse last summer, Joshua opted to face his WBO mandatory challenger and former undisputed cruiserweight champion Usyk instead. It appeared the easier fight for Joshua, but boxing's triumphant return to stadium nights was soured for the home crowd by a truly exceptional performance from the challenger. 5 Live boxing podcast: Analysis of Joshua's defeat How the boxing world reacted to the fight Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn suggested his fighter may have suffered a broken eye socket and would need to go to hospital. ""I don't know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn't look great,"" he said. ""He said he couldn't see after the ninth round, obviously he was getting tagged a lot as well."" A devastated Joshua left the ring immediately after the decision but laterposted a short message on Twitter,,externalsaying: ""Keep positive even if the world's crumbling in front of you! London I love you & thank you each and every time!"" I'm not a sulker - I will bounce back, says defeated Joshua 'Why didn't he have a go?' Pundits bemused by 'negative' Joshua Joshua v Usyk - fight as it unfolded, and reaction Joshua was relaxed and cheerful as he approached the ring, but concentration was etched on his face from the first bell. Usyk's abilities quickly became apparent, the 34-year-old full of feints and pace from the off, moving Joshua around the ring at will as the defending champion settled into a surprisingly passive role. A few warning shots from Joshua fell short in the early rounds, Usyk either catching them with a glove or spinning away. It would become the pattern of the fight as Usyk made Joshua miss and executed a perfect gameplan of his own. A left cross from Usyk rattled Joshua in the third round, and prompted a noisy response from the crowd. Joshua rode the danger, failing to respond, but making it to the bell safely. Usyk was now brimming with confidence and the London crowd tried in vain to rouse their man into life. A low shot from Joshua brought a complaint from Usyk and Joshua fired off another, perhaps sensing a weakness in his opponent. Round five was Joshua's best to that point, but Usyk remained in control and the Briton continued to miss his attempts to land any meaningful shots. Finally, in the sixth round, Joshua landed his right hand, sparking a response form Usyk, who widened his stance and appeared ready to trade. Joshua backed off, wary of a firefight. And Joshua's fears were realised in the seventh as Usyk responded brilliantly to stun him with a left hook to the chin and send him stumbling backwards. Joshua stayed on his feet, surviving the round but now in a dire predicament. Usyk was comfortably ahead on the scorecards and Joshua struggled to close the gap. The huge weight advantage was nowhere in evidence, with Usyk keeping the fight at range and urgings from Joshua's corner to move forward appearing to fall on deaf ears. Joshua had Usyk briefly on the ropes in the ninth but returned to his corner with a bloody nose having caught a hard shot to the face in the closing seconds of the round. There was blood on the faces of both men in the 11th round. Joshua had a cut and swelling on his eye; Usyk had a gash on his left eye. But while Usyk's mouth was open, he was by far the busier fighter in the penultimate round, outclassing Joshua with ease once again. The crowd desperately tried to inspire the defending champion, who needed a knockout in the final round. But it was the challenger who almost found the decisive punch, pushing a dazed Joshua on to the ropes. The bell saved Joshua from suffering another knockout defeat and there was a nervous wait for Usyk's team for the scorecards. There were to be no more shocks, however, as all three judges gave it to the challenger and ended Joshua's short second reign as world champion after just one fight. This video can not be played Anthony Joshua v Oleksandr Usyk: I'll still fight Tyson Fury without the belts - Joshua It is unclear where Joshua goes from here. There is a rematch clause, one that the two-time world champion is likely to exercise. He now has two losses to his name and on both occasions the Briton was dominated by a smaller man. Usyk did not find the knockout punch, but he exposed Joshua's frailties and somewhat light attacking arsenal. Joshua had no answer to Usyk and while his opponent glided across the ring, the champion appeared to be dragging his feet through mud. There was no attempt to bully Usyk, wear him down or go to the body. It was a strange, almost hapless display from Joshua which leaves his legacy as one of the heavyweight greats in ruins. Aside from the Briton's long-term career prospects, Joshua versus Fury now appears to be dead. Fury fights Deontay Wilder next month in Las Vegas and every fight fan's greatest fear has been realised after the unification bout collapsed last summer. To begin with, Joshua will have to win his rematch with Usyk which, after Saturday night's meeting, appears a near impossible prospect. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn said his fighter had given Usyk too much respect and would have to make ""fundamental changes"" to regain his titles. ""We knew it [defeat] could happen if he didn't get it right, and he didn't get it right,"" Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He took too many shots early and Usyk was more aggressive than I thought he would be and he was the deserved winner. ""Tony Bellew's comments about overthinking, and it fatiguing you, were right. It is like these last three or four days you get spellbound by Usyk and you end up giving him too much respect and that becomes a problem."" Hearn said Joshua was already thinking about how to beat Usyk next time. ""He is going to go away and all he will do is think about Oleksandr Usyk. He will be thinking 'how can I beat him, how can I improve?' He is obsessed with improving,"" said Hearn. ""I just feel there is so much more Anthony Joshua in that fight but he will have to do a lot more in the rematch to be victorious."" Float:Will it be sink or swim for this poolside romance?

"This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""We will not unfairly hit working families"" Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out tax rises if Labour wins power, but he promised they would ""not unfairly hit working families"". The party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We want those with the broadest shoulders to pay."" But he said it was too far from an election to make firm tax commitments. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said she did not have ""any plans to increase the rates of income tax"" if Labour wins the next election. Asked about her comments by Andrew Marr, Sir Keir said: ""We are looking at tax, nothing is off the table, but we don't know what state of finances will be as we go into the election and nor does anybody else."" Rayner won't apologise for calling PM 'scum' Labour members back nationalising energy industry Starmer should fight election on Brexit - Benn He accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""whacking working people"" with a tax hike, withhis plan to increase National Insuranceto pay for the NHS and social care. In his Marr interview, the Labour leader revealed he would not nationalise the big six energy companies if he were to become prime minister - despite a pledge to support ""common ownership"" of the sector in his party leadership campaign last year. Rachel Reeves will give her first speech to conference as shadow chancellor on Monday He said he would be ""pragmatic"" and not ""ideological"" when it came to nationalisation, saying: ""Where common ownership is value for money for the tax payer and delivers better services then there should be common ownership."" But the former leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, called on Sir Keir to stick to his pledge and show more ""radicalism"", claiming the result would be ""the opinion polls [starting] to move upwards."" The Labour conference, in Brighton, backed a motion, put forward by Unite and the CWU union, calling for the nationalisation of energy companies. The Labour leader also promised children in England an ""education fit for the future"", paid for by a tax on private schools, if he wins power, in aninterview with The Sunday Mirror,external. Ms Reeves will unveil more details in her conference speech on Monday, but a number of Labour's tax and spending policies have already been confirmed: A new ""Office of Value for Money"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely Covering all day-to-day spending by balancing the current budget - but also borrowing to invest Introducing a target to reduce the national debt Who are the people with ""the broadest shoulders"" who will pay more tax under a Labour government? The party has given two specific examples recently. Removing the charitable status of private schools would make them pay an estimated Â£1.5bn a year in tax. Making private equity fund managers pay full income tax on a type of earning called ""carried interest"" would raise about Â£440m. In an interviewwith the Sunday Times,external, Rachel Reeves suggested a few more: income from stocks and shares and buy-to-let properties. What the general public would really notice, though, are changes to the rates of the big things we all pay: income tax and national insurance. And Starmer and Reeves have kept their options open on a potential rise in the former or whether they'd scrap the government's increase of the second. But the ""broadest shoulders"" rhetoric suggests any increase would be targeted at the wealthy. Which means we really need to know how Labour would apply their tape measure to the nation's shoulders to separate the broad from the narrow. Elsewhere at the conference, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband set out plans to ""green"" the UK steel industry by investing Â£3bn over 10 years in decarbonisation. The former Labour leader also accused the Conservatives failing to protect steelmakers from being undercut by cheap steel imports, as well as spending tens of millions on imported steel to build schools and hospitals. Mr Miliband also describe the current gas prices crisis as a ""disaster made in Downing Street"" because of ""inaction"" from the government, adding: ""As we respond to the climate crisis with all the transformation that entails, we have a fateful choice to make.

This video can not be played ""My life has been turned upside down,"" Ms Meng tells reporters after being freed from Canadian detention Before her arrest, US prosecutors accused Ms Meng of fraud, alleging that she misled banks into processing transactions for Huawei that broke US sanctions against Iran. As part of a deferred prosecution agreement, Ms Meng admitted to misleading HSBC about Huawei's relationship with Skycom, a Hong-Kong based company that operated in Iran. China's foreign ministry said the charges against her had been ""fabricated"" to suppress the country's high-tech industries, according to state media. But in a statement the US justice department insisted it would continue to prepare for trial against Huawei, which is still on a trade blacklist. Ms Meng is the elder daughter of Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. He also served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei itself is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. It has faced accusations that Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban.

"Sir Keir Starmer has been forced to drop changes to the way Labour elects its leaders after they were rejected by the party's left wing. He had wanted to scrap one-member-one vote - but opponents said that would give Labour MPs too much say over who gets the top job. Sir Keir is now hoping to get members to back a watered-down package of reforms in a conference vote on Sunday. He says they will help the party win the next general election. The row over Labour's constitution began earlier this week, when the leader proposed changing the way his successors would be chosen. Labour launches conference with fair pay promise People wrongly assume Sir Keir is posh - top aide Labour: Has Starmer stood by his pledges? He had wanted to replace the current one-member-one-vote system with an ""electoral college"" system - abolished by predecessor Ed Miliband - under which Labour members would only account for a third of the votes in a future leadership contest. MPs and unions would also each have made up a third of the votes. But Sir Keir had to drop his proposals after he failed to persuade the big Labour-backing unions to support them. Activist group Momentum called the proposed rule change ""an MP veto by the backdoor"", adding: ""Handing this much power to a Westminster elite is the opposite of democracy."" Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) approved a diluted package of reforms earlier on Saturday, but they will also need to be agreed by party members. The package includes: A rule that any candidate would need the backing of 20% of party MPs to get onto the leadership ballot - up from the current 10% Increasing the percentage of local party members needed to trigger a reselection process for their MP - up to 50% from a third Scrapping registered supporters - where voters can pay a one-off fee to vote in the leadership election Another rule where people will have to have been a party member for six months before they can vote for a leader These new plans were agreed by 22 votes to 12. Speaking after the meeting at the party's conference in Brighton, Sir Keir said: ""I'm very pleased these party reforms have got the backing of our NEC. ""These proposals put us in a better position to win the next general election and I hope constituency and trade union delegates will support them when they come to conference floor."" Sir Keir Starmer has got to project himself to sceptical voters outside the conference hall, but it looks as though internal rows will dominate this weekend. He got the backing of his ruling national executive for a watered down package of reforms. But it is still a very significant package of reforms. For example, in future leadership contests, in order to get onto the ballot in the first place, candidates will need the backing of 20% of MPs instead of 10%. That may sound like a boring procedural change, but to put it into context, it would have meant last time round that Sir Keir would have been the only candidate and it would have prevented Jeremy Corbyn getting on the ballot in the first place. Labour's left are absolutely infuriated by this and when it is debated on the conference floor, they will resist it. So, while Sir Keir may want the story of the conference to focus on his efforts to be in touch with working people, it could be overshadowed by this row. What's going on with Labour's row? Sir Keir and predecessor Jeremy Corbyn were both elected under the one-member-one vote system - but plans to scrap it were seen on the left as an attempt to stop another radical left-wing candidate, like Mr Corbyn, winning the leadership again. And unions seen as sympathetic to the party leader failed to back the proposals on Friday, meaning they could not go to a full vote at conference. A source close to Sir Keir said that the leadership election reforms had not been presented to the party as ""a take-it-or-leave-it deal"", adding: ""That's how we've approached it and we're pleased with where we've ended up."" Conference also voted by 59% 41% to keep David Evans, an ally of Sir Keir, as Labour's general secretary. Many on the left had wanted to remove him and there were chants of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" within the hall as Mr Evans addressed delegates before the ballot was held.

"Drivers encountered lengthy queues at many forecourts on Saturday A temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to work in the UK is set to run for three months, ending on Christmas eve. It is understood about 5,000 visas may be issued, with more details about the scheme set to be announced on Sunday. A shortage of drivers has disrupted fuel deliveries, with some petrol stations closing, and queues forming. The government has said there is no fuel shortage at refineries, and urged people not to panic buy. The president of the AA said panic-buying rather than supply chain issues was driving the shortage of fuel at some petrol stations. Edmund King added that the problem should pass in a matter of days if drivers only fill up when they need it, adding ""there is plenty of fuel at source"". MPs and police forces have called on drivers to be ""sensible"", to consider filling up another time, and to avoid stockpiling fuel in jerry cans. One petrol station boss from Ferndale, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, appealed for calm amidcontinued high demand for fuel on Saturday. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Nike and Costco warn of product shortages and delays Meanwhile, the continued shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. Trade association Logistics UK estimates that the UK is in need of about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. The foreign drivers eligible for visas will not be limited to the EU, but the expectation is most of the drivers will be from Europe. A raft of longer-term measures. including training up more drivers and addressing the backlog of driving tests, are also to be introduced by ministers. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood welcomed the introduction of the temporary visa but said this would not help overnight. As well as training more domestic drivers and speeding-up testing, Mr Ellwood said hundreds of Afghan refugees could be trained to fill vacancies. Jennifer Ward, a student paramedic, had to travel to five stations to get diesel for her ambulance Jennifer Ward, a student paramedic of three years for Medicare EMS, which provides 999 frontline support to the East of England Ambulance Service, said she had to travel to five stations to get diesel for her ambulance. She was eventually able to use the lorry pumps at a petrol station in Chelmsford. The 21-year-old said: ""No patient care was delayed because of this, ambulances were still being sent to jobs. ""It was more the anxiety of not knowing where we can fill up when you're on three quarters of a tank, I could be sent anywhere, I could be sent to Norwich and I could have had no fuel."" Matt McDonnell, chief executive of Medicare EMS, said a member of staff cancelled their shift on Saturday because they had been unable to get fuel. Ambulance drivers were also struggling to get enough fuel for their shifts, he said. He added: ""If it carries on and gets worse we may be in a situation where we are unable to meet our contractual needs. I'm waiting to see what they [the government] will do about it, whether they will introduce what they did last year for key workers and shopping, or something like that."" Rosie Osborne, a wedding singer, was queuing for petrol in Balham Hill, south London, before travelling to a wedding in Somerset, where she will front the band. ""I'm in the red and I need to get petrol ASAP,"" she said. ""I have been sat in this queue for 50 minutes and I didn't want to risk getting petrol elsewhere en route, but I am nearly on empty so I need to get petrol anyway."" But there was no such pressure for one driver in Leeds who says that, while she only has 21 miles left in her tank, ""I'll just walk or get the bus"" if she can't fill up. One woman, who lives in York, says she had managed to get some fuel on Friday night which she needed to enable her to help her 91-year-old mother who lived in Leeds. ""She would have been stuck,"" she says. ""It's very difficult."" This video can not be played Drivers react to long petrol queues: 'I'm on red and I need to get petrol ASAP' Sainsbury's said it was experiencing ""high demand"" for fuel, with a ""tiny proportion of sites"" temporarily closed. BP said about 20 of its 1,200 petrol forecourts were closed, with between 50 and 100 sites affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel. A ""small number"" of Esso-branded Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted, said Esso's owner ExxonMobil. EG Group, which has 341 petrol stations in the UK, is introducing a limit of Â£30 per customer on all grades of fuel due to ""unprecedented customer demand"". Business minister Greg Hands said fewer than 1% of petrol stations were closed and there was ""easily enough petrol available for normal use at this time of year"". One petrol station in Stockport sold 5,280 gallons (24,000 litres) of fuel on Friday, compared with 1,760 gallons (8,000 litres) on the same day the previous week. This isn't a particularly popular idea with many cabinet ministers. That's because the new immigration system that came in after Brexit was all about saying to companies: ""You can't rely on cheap foreign labour any more, you've got to focus on the workforce in this country, you've got to train them, you've got to pay them better wages."" Relaxing those immigration rules now undermines that message. It could lead to other sectors saying they want special treatment too. Ministers know this situation could get very difficult, very quickly. So they do have to act - even though this is going to cause huge political embarrassment. Labour are already saying - we told you about this, we said this should happen months ago. Boris Johnson knows all too well his opponents are going to be very ready to say: ""We told you so."" The European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a ""good idea"" but are ""only part of the solution"" - and warned staying in the EU may be more appealing for drivers. Allan Davison, managing director of Hoyer Petrolog UK - BP's transport contractor - said temporary visas were needed to ease the current problems. Lorry drivers have said some of the conditions they face in the job were putting off younger recruits - the average age of a HGV driver in the UK is 55. Vehicles queue for fuel at a Sainsbury's petrol station in Weymouth A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages."" The spokesperson said the government was looking at temporary, time-limited measures to introduce. ""We are moving to a high wage, high skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,"" the spokesperson added.

"Up to 10,500 lorry drivers and poultry workers can receive temporary UK visas as the government seeks to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas. The government confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers will be eligible to work in the UK for three months, until Christmas Eve. The scheme is also being extended to 5,500 poultry workers. The transport secretary said he did not want to ""undercut"" British workers but could not stand by while queues formed. But the British Chambers of Commerce said the measures were the equivalent of ""throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire"". And the Road Haulage Association said the announcement ""barely scratches the surface"", adding that only offering visas until Christmas Eve ""will not be enough for companies or the drivers themselves to be attractive"". Marc Fels, director of the HGV Recruitment Centre, said visas for lorry drivers were ""too little"" and ""too late"". However, the news was welcomed by freight industry group Logistics UK, which called the policy ""a huge step forward in solving the disruption to supply chains"". How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Nike and Costco warn of product shortages and delays A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries in recent months, from supermarkets to fast food chains. In recent days, some fuel deliveries have been affected, leading to lengthy queues at petrol stations - despite ministers insisting the UK has plenty of fuel. There are reports of dozens of cars queuing in London by 07:00 BST on Sunday morning, while many filling stations had signs up saying they had no fuel. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC's Andrew Marr that there was enough fuel in the country and that if people were ""sensible"" and only filled up when they needed to there would not be shortages. As well as allowing more foreign workers, other measures include using Ministry of Defence examiners to increase HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, and sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry. Officials said the loan of MoD examiners would help put on ""thousands of extra tests"" over the next 12 weeks. Recruitment for additional short-term HGV drivers and poultry workers will begin in October. Mr Shapps said: ""We are acting now, but the industries must also play their part with working conditions continuing to improve and the deserved salary increases continuing to be maintained in order for companies to retain new drivers."" A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage Logistics UK estimates that the UK is in need of about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic, tax changes, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. The British Poultry Council has previously warned it may not have the workforce to process as many turkeys as normal this Christmas because it has historically relied on EU labour - but after Brexit it is now more difficult and expensive to use non-UK workers. The Department for Transport said it recognised that importing foreign labour ""will not be the long-term solution"" to the problem and that it wanted to see employers invest to build a ""high-wage, high-skill economy"". It said up to 4,000 people would soon be able to take advantage of training courses to become HGV drivers. This includes free, short, intensive courses, funded by the Department for Education, to train up to 3,000 new HGV drivers. These new ""skills bootcamps"" will train drivers to be road ready and gain a Cat C or Cat C&E license, helping to tackle the current HGV driver shortage. The remaining 1,000 drivers will be trained through courses accessed locally and funded by the government's adult education budget, the DfT said. Fuel tanker drivers need additional safety qualifications and the government said it was working with the industry to ensure drivers can access these as quickly as possible. Mr Fels said many young people were ""desperate"" to get into the industry but couldn't afford the thousands of pounds it costs to get a HGV license. He called for the government to recognise the industry as a ""vocation"" and offer student loans to help fund training. Sue Terpilowski, from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, said conditions for drivers also needed to improve, pointing out that facilities such as overnight lorry parks were much better on the continent. Richard Walker, managing director at supermarket Iceland, said it was ""about time"" ministers relaxed immigration rules in a bid to solve the HGV driver shortage and called for key workers, including food retail workers, to be prioritised at the pumps. On Saturday the BBC spoke to a number of drivers who had queued or struggled to get fuel. Jennifer Ward, a student paramedic of three years for Medicare EMS, which provides 999 frontline support to the East of England Ambulance Service, said she had to travel to five stations to get diesel for her ambulance. Matt McDonnell, chief executive of Medicare EMS, said a member of staff cancelled their shift because they had been unable to get fuel and said he was waiting to see if the government would introduce measures to prioritise key workers, like they had for shopping during the pandemic. Industry groups the Food and Drink Federation and Logistics UK both welcomed the visa changes, with federation chief Ian Wright calling the measures ""pragmatic"". But the British Retail Consortium said the number of visas being offered would ""do little to alleviate the current shortfall"". It said supermarkets alone needed an additional 15,000 HGV drivers to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the changes were needed but described them as ""a sticking plaster at the eleventh hour"". ""Once again the government has been caught asleep at the wheel when they should have been planning for months for this scenario,"" she told the BBC.

"Mohammed Ali said there were queues at his petrol pumps before 08:00 on Saturday A petrol station boss has appealed for calm amid continued high demand for fuel after panic buying hit Wales. Mohammed Ali, who runs the Murco garage in Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said ""chaos"" continued on Saturday despite insisting there was no fuel shortage. A tanker has already resupplied his station after he ran out on Friday despite rationing fuel to Â£15 per car. Severalsupermarkets closed their petrol stationsin Wales and beyond on Friday due to demand. Disruption continued on Saturday, including at Tesco Extra, Bridgend, Asda stores in Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff north, along with Sainsbury's in Wrexham and at the well-known ""Black Cat"" garage at the junction of the A55 and A470 in Conwy. Nike and Costco warn of product shortages and delays 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year North Wales Police urged people not to form long queues and ""unnecessary obstructions"" in roads and said petrol stations in the area had reported ""no disruption to deliveries at the majority of sites and fuel deliveries are expected to continue as usual"". A shortage of drivers has hit deliveries but ministers and industry leaders insist there is no shortage and they have urged people not to panic buy. The UK government is planning atemporary schemeto make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to work in the UK. Mr Ali said the rush on fuel started after the media had ""blown things out of proportion"". ""We had a delivery at six o'clock in the morning and we opened at seven... and it's already chaos over there,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfaston Saturday. ""There is no need for this. There is no such thing as a fuel shortage,"" he said. This video can not be played People should carry on buying petrol as normal, the UK government says The Road Haulage Association estimates the UK is short of about 100,000 HGV drivers with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic and Brexit. Jason Edwards, boss of Edwards Coaches in Llantrisant, said he was receiving daily calls from other companies asking for help to cover school bus contracts due to a shortage of drivers. He said the problem had arisen due to a rise in drivers' pay while companies were running fixed-term school bus contracts with an agreed cost. Mr Edwards also said drivers and vehicles had to leave an hour early to get to schools on Friday due to the traffic outside petrol stations. Motorists were seen queuing for a petrol station in Treforest ""Unless the Department of Transport... allow European travellers temporary work permits, this is not going to go away - it's going to get worse,"" he said.

"""If I'm out and find myself alone, I tend to look for other groups of girls - I feel safer knowing other girls are out,"" says student nurse Freya Stewart. As students return to Cardiff for the new term, efforts are being made to help freshers and others feel as safe as possible. South Wales Police said it understood recent events had caused concern and was running high-visibility patrols. A business group has organised 35 billboards with links to safety advice. Students urged to get Covid jab in freshers' week Uni place offers less likely for diverse students 'I worried Oxford wouldn't accept me' Organised by For Cardiff, which represents city centre companies, the adverts have QR codes to direct people to a list of nearby""safe spaces"",externalthey can visit if they feel at risk. It will run for two weeks as part of freshers' fortnight, but some students have said it should become a permanent fixture. Digital billboards around the city centre will display QR codes The campaign was prompted bya recent report,externalwhich suggested 80% of women in the UK had been sexually harassed in public spaces. There have also been calls to""overhaul the justice system""to better tackle violence against women after a Metropolitan Police officeradmitted raping and killing 33-year-old Sarah Everard in London. Carolyn Brownell, head of marketing and communications at For Cardiff, said it was important as many businesses as possible signed up to scheme to make it an even safer network. Carolyn Brownell wants Cardiff to be as safe as it can be for people going home on their own, regardless of the time of day One business that has joined is the Angel Hotel in the heart of the city. The hotel has let many young people wait in the lobby, charge phones or seek support from staff, sales manager Sarah Pedlar said. The Angel Hotel has been registered a ""safe space"" since 2013 A Cardiff University spokesperson said it supported the campaign and had a number of measures in place, including a safe taxi scheme and security staff on campus at all times to help students feel safe during freshers' fortnight and beyond. Last month,a man admitted raping a womanin the city's Bute Park. Tyler Higgins, 19, attacked the woman in the early hours of 15 July. Five days later, 54-year-old Gary Jenkins was attacked in a nearby part of the park. The doctor died after 16 days in hospital andthree people have been charged with his murder. Three people have been charged with the murder of Gary Jenkins in Bute Park Cardiff University student Gwen Weldon has worked in the park for four years and said she now felt uneasy when walking home - especially as the winter nights draw in. ""I don't feel comfortable at all - my boss has it in place that we all walk home together,"" the 22-year-old said. ""Especially in the dark, it's quite jarring, before I didn't mind it so much but now it puts me on edge a lot."" Gwen Weldon says she has been approached by men multiple times in the day But she said feeling uncomfortable in the day was not something out of the ordinary, with one incident leaving her ""genuinely scared"". ""A couple of weeks ago I was going to the bakery at nine in the morning and this guy came up to me asking to have sex and how much I cost. ""He got in my face about it, I was genuinely scared I was going to be followed."" She said recent initiatives to make the city safer made her ""rest a lot easier"" but would like to see more CCTV cameras in the 23-acre park. Female athletes 'harassed' while training outdoors 'Out of practice' students urged to party safely Freya Stewart says she feels very safe in Cardiff For 21-year-old Freya Stewart, staying with friends or people you know when out is the most important thing to feeling safe. ""If I'm out and find myself alone, I tend to look for other groups of girls - I feel safer knowing other girls are out,"" the student nurse said. She said the billboard campaign was helpful but questioned how practical it was for those who are drunk. ""The time I get worried about my friends is when they are very drunk and I don't think a very, very drunk person would be able to scan a QR code and find a location,"" she said. Ashley Morgan, who runs a campaign called Change the Discourse to raise awareness of women's safety, said harassment happened to women of all ages. She said it was important to understand harassment was ""any unwanted behaviour, particularly in public by somebody you don't know"". ""It's not up to women to fix it and I find that massively problematic because we can't,"" says Dr Morgan As someone who has been running for 33 years, she said this had been a constant feature in her life. ""There's too much focus on women being incumbent on keeping themselves safe,"" she said. The sociologist at Cardiff Metropolitan University said: ""What we need to do is say, 'don't attack women, men' and we clearly need to say it because it's not stopping."" She said a group of male Cardiff University students had not been given enough ""kudos"" forsetting up a chaperoning service for women at universitywhen they saw a Facebook post threatening to rape women. ""I love the fact that there are men out there who were willing to put their hands up and say, 'this is wrong'.""

It will be running ""proactive patrols"" on the railway line between Pontypridd and Cathays during the freshers' fortnight and emphasising its discreet text service. Latest figures for September show that the force has recorded six sexual or unwanted sexual behaviour offences in Wales so far in 2021. Supt Morgan said rail travel across Wales was ""very safe"" compared to other parts of the UK and crime was low, but recognised ""enough is enough and we have to be seen to take action on these offenders"". Reports via the text service will be used to gather information on potential offenders or offer victims help if they wish to prosecute Ch Supt Wendy Gunney, the South Wales Police divisional commander for Cardiff and the Vale, said the force understood ""recent events have caused concern"" but the city had an ""excellent history"" of working with others to ""ensure its night-time economy is safe, vibrant and welcoming"". She said there were high-visibility patrols around the centre, two safety buses running every night during the freshers' fortnight and the force was working with the council to increase their CCTV coverage in Bute Park and along other routes home from the city. South Wales Police volunteers are helping people get home safely during freshers' fortnight ""In relation to recent incidents, individuals have been arrested and charged, and while our investigations and patrols continue we want people to be able to go out, enjoy themselves and feel safe in our capital city."" ""Officers have been trained to help them identify and safeguard vulnerable people and we regularly see examples where this training has paid off,"" she said, adding that anyone with concerns was encouraged to approach a police officer.

"This video can not be played Watch: More than 500 people attend vigil for Sabina Nessa A book of condolence has been opened for people to pay respects to teacher Sabina Nessa, who was killed as she walked to a pub in south-east London. The book is in a community centre near Cator Park in Kidbrooke, close to where the 28-year-old's body was discovered. On Friday, more than 500 people joineda vigil in Pegler Square,near to where a wanted suspect was seen on CCTV. He was filmed in Pegler Square on the night of the killing carrying what is thought to be ""a reflective red item"". Detectives said they ""retain an open mind as to whether this was used in the attack on Sabina"". Sabina Nessa was found near the One Space community centre in Kidbrooke Appealing for further help to identify the man, Det Ch Insp Neil John said he may have been ""trying to conceal it [the red item] up his sleeve"". ""Please share the CCTV footage on social media and... show the image to family members and friends who may not have seen it. ""He must be traced,"" he added. Two men who were arrested on suspicion of murder have both since been released pending further investigations. Police said they were ""content that neither of them is the man shown in the CCTV footage"". This video can not be played Police want to speak to a man shown walking in Pegler Square Ms Nessa was attacked as she was walking to meet a friend at The Depot bar on 17 September, shortly after leaving her home in Astell Road. Her body was found the following day by a member of the public near a walkway in the park. The book of condolence has been opened at the OpenSpace community centre. The centre's manager Kathryn Gosden said they planned to give the book to Ms Nessa's family ""to show that Sabina was part of this community... and we are sorry and will remember her"". She added that those living in the area were still ""very, very scared"" about what had happened. ""Even today, people are out in twos and threes, they're not out on their own,"" she said. Police have also released an image of a car they believe the wanted man had access to More candles and tributes have also been left in Pegler Square, where hundreds of people gathered for Friday evening's vigil. Addressing the crowd on Friday evening, Ms Nessa's sister Jebina Yasmin Islam said she had ""lost an amazing, caring, beautiful sister, who left this world far too early"". Others members of her family spoke at a separate rally earlier that evening at East London Mosque. A candle was also lit outside No 10 Downing Street in memory of Ms Nessa, while the Duchess of Cambridge said she was ""saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets"". Megan Paterson, BBC News correspondent With every hour that passes the number of flowers, cards and candles left near where Sabina Nessa's body was found continues to grow. There are letters from friends and colleagues, and many more from people who didn't know Sabina Nessa but want to pay tribute to her. Three heart shaped red balloons float beside the pathway she would have taken on her way to meet a friend last Friday, near the place where she was attacked. Having been closed behind the police cordon all week, the OpenSpace Community Centre has opened its doors today, offering people the chance to sign a book of condolence. A space normally used for dance lessons, football training and coffee mornings is now a focus for a grieving community. Meanwhile, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Baird said police needed to better protect the public, rather than women being asked to take precautions. Crowds gathered not far from the crime scene where forensic officers are still working Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Vera said: ""Apparently the police have been giving out rape alarms to women and giving leaflets out saying how to stay safe in a public place. ""It is less, isn't it, about giving women leaflets on keeping themselves safe in dangerous places and more about the police making the streets safe for women?"" Candles have been lit in Pegler Square where Friday's vigil was held She added: ""Three-quarters of women over 16 have been harassed in a public place and don't feel safe. ""They need to know that the police understand that and will use all the powers they have got to keep the streets safe."" Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Met Police Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe previously said the force was not asking women to change their behaviour when going out at night. ""Violence against women and girls is a priority for police across the UK but we're really conscious that women should be free to go about their lives without fear of abuse."" She added violence against women was ""something that is tolerated far too much in society and we the police are determined to bring offenders to justice and to prevent these offences where we can"".

"Sir Keir Starmer has been forced to drop changes to the way Labour elects its leaders after they were rejected by the party's left wing. He had wanted to scrap one-member-one vote - but opponents said that would give Labour MPs too much say over who gets the top job. Sir Keir is now hoping to get members to back a watered-down package of reforms in a conference vote on Sunday. He says they will help the party win the next general election. The row over Labour's constitution began earlier this week, when the leader proposed changing the way his successors would be chosen. Labour launches conference with fair pay promise People wrongly assume Sir Keir is posh - top aide Labour: Has Starmer stood by his pledges? He had wanted to replace the current one-member-one-vote system with an ""electoral college"" system - abolished by predecessor Ed Miliband - under which Labour members would only account for a third of the votes in a future leadership contest. MPs and unions would also each have made up a third of the votes. But Sir Keir had to drop his proposals after he failed to persuade the big Labour-backing unions to support them. Activist group Momentum called the proposed rule change ""an MP veto by the backdoor"", adding: ""Handing this much power to a Westminster elite is the opposite of democracy."" Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) approved a diluted package of reforms earlier on Saturday, but they will also need to be agreed by party members. The package includes: A rule that any candidate would need the backing of 20% of party MPs to get onto the leadership ballot - up from the current 10% Increasing the percentage of local party members needed to trigger a reselection process for their MP - up to 50% from a third Scrapping registered supporters - where voters can pay a one-off fee to vote in the leadership election Another rule where people will have to have been a party member for six months before they can vote for a leader These new plans were agreed by 22 votes to 12. Speaking after the meeting at the party's conference in Brighton, Sir Keir said: ""I'm very pleased these party reforms have got the backing of our NEC. ""These proposals put us in a better position to win the next general election and I hope constituency and trade union delegates will support them when they come to conference floor."" Sir Keir Starmer has got to project himself to sceptical voters outside the conference hall, but it looks as though internal rows will dominate this weekend. He got the backing of his ruling national executive for a watered down package of reforms. But it is still a very significant package of reforms. For example, in future leadership contests, in order to get onto the ballot in the first place, candidates will need the backing of 20% of MPs instead of 10%. That may sound like a boring procedural change, but to put it into context, it would have meant last time round that Sir Keir would have been the only candidate and it would have prevented Jeremy Corbyn getting on the ballot in the first place. Labour's left are absolutely infuriated by this and when it is debated on the conference floor, they will resist it. So, while Sir Keir may want the story of the conference to focus on his efforts to be in touch with working people, it could be overshadowed by this row. What's going on with Labour's row? Sir Keir and predecessor Jeremy Corbyn were both elected under the one-member-one vote system - but plans to scrap it were seen on the left as an attempt to stop another radical left-wing candidate, like Mr Corbyn, winning the leadership again. And unions seen as sympathetic to the party leader failed to back the proposals on Friday, meaning they could not go to a full vote at conference. A source close to Sir Keir said that the leadership election reforms had not been presented to the party as ""a take-it-or-leave-it deal"", adding: ""That's how we've approached it and we're pleased with where we've ended up."" Conference also voted by 59% 41% to keep David Evans, an ally of Sir Keir, as Labour's general secretary. Many on the left had wanted to remove him and there were chants of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" within the hall as Mr Evans addressed delegates before the ballot was held.

"Taliban fighters - pictured here in Herat on 10 September - have been patrolling the centre of the city The Taliban say they have shot dead four alleged kidnappers and hung their bodies in public squares in the Afghan city of Herat. The gruesome display came a day after a notorious Taliban official warned that extreme punishments such as executions and amputations would resume. The men were killed in a gun battle after allegedly seizing a businessman and his son, a local official said. Local residents said a body was hung from a crane in the city centre. Wazir Ahmad Seddiqi, a local shopkeeper, told the Associated Press news agency that four bodies were brought to the square, one was hung there and the three other bodies were moved to other squares in the city to be displayed. The deputy governor of Herat, Maulwai Shair, said displaying the bodies was done to deter further abductions. He said the men were killed in a gun battle after the Taliban learnt that they had kidnapped a businessman and his son - who were both freed. The BBC has not independently confirmed the circumstances under which the men were killed. However, graphic images shared on social media appeared to show bloody bodies on the back of a pick-up truck with a crane hoisting one man up. Another video showed a man suspended from a crane with a sign on his chest reading: ""Abductors will be punished like this."" Since taking power in Afghanistan on 15 August, the Taliban have been promising a milder form of rule than in their previous tenure. But there have already been numerous reports of human rights abuses carried out across the country. The Taliban's notorious former head of religious police Mullah Nooruddin Turabi - now in charge of prisons - said on Thursday that extreme punishments such asexecutions and amputations would resumein Afghanistan as they were ""necessary for security"". In an interview with AP, he said these punishments may not be meted out in public, as they were under previous Taliban rule in the 1990s. Public executions were frequently held in Kabul's sports stadium or on the vast grounds of the Eid Gah mosque during the group's five year rule. But he dismissed outrage over their past public executions: ""No-one will tell us what our laws should be."" Turabi - who is on a UN sanctions list for his past actions - added that ""everyone criticised us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and punishments"". In August, Amnesty International said that Taliban fighters were behind the massacre of nine members of the persecuted Hazara minority. Amnesty's Secretary-General AgnÃ¨s Callamard said at the time that the ""cold-blooded brutality"" of the killings was ""a reminder of the Taliban's past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring"".

"The volcano has been filling the sky with ash and a thick plume of smoke Intensifying volcanic explosions have forced the airport on the Spanish island of La Palma to be closed. The Cumbre Vieja volcano started erupting last Sunday with thousands evacuated and more than 350 homes destroyed. A thick plume of smoke now extends four kilometres (2.4 miles) into the air. Clouds of thick ash have made flights out of the airport impossible, authorities said on Saturday. The closure has prevented some leaving the island's airport, which mostly handles many tourist flights and connections to other islands in the Canaries. Long queues formed at the terminal as flights were cancelled, and some travellers tried to get ferries off the island. The volcano is entering a fresh explosive phase, spewing lava from a newly opened vent, officials say. Airport operators say ash accumulation has made the airport ""inoperative"", but that a clean-up operation is underway. Workers are sweeping volcanic ash from the runway. On Friday, firefighters said they were withdrawing from the area ""due to the intensification of explosive phenomena"". No fatalities have been reported. La Palma volcano: Visual guide to what happened Volcanic eruptions of fire and lava have intensified in recent days Some 1,000 people in Tajuya, Tacande de Abajo and Tacande de Arriba were told to evacuate on Fridaydue to the intensifying volcanic activity,external. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said on Friday that the cabinet would next week declare the island a ""catastrophe zone"". The Canary Islands government has already announced a first round of financial aid for people who have lost their homes. 'Miracle house' escapes Canary Islands lava Hundreds more evacuated as La Palma lava nears sea The volcano lies in the south of La Palma island, which is home to around 80,000 people. It last erupted 50 years ago, in 1971. Scientists are unsure how long this eruption will last. A spokesperson for Spain's National Geographic Institute told the BBC that past eruptions on La Palma have lasted between 24 and 84 days.

"Michael Kovrig (r) and Michael Spavor have been held since 2018 A diplomatic row between China and the West appears to be ending, after the release of two Canadians held in China and a Chinese tech executive in Canada. Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, arrested on a US warrant in 2018, left Canada on Friday in a deal with US prosecutors. Hours later it was announced that Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, accused of espionage by China in the same year, were flying home to Canada. Beijing denies detaining the Canadians in retaliation for Ms Meng's arrest. But critics have accused China of using them as political bargaining chips. The two men had maintained their innocence throughout. At a news conference, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said they had been through ""an unbelievably difficult ordeal"". ""It is good news for all of us that they are on their way home to their families,"" he added. ""For the past 1,000 days, they have shown strength, perseverance, resilience and grace."" The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress The prime minister said both men will arrive in Canada early on Saturday. They are being accompanied by Dominic Barton, Canada's ambassador to China. Before her release, Ms Meng - the daughter of Ren Zhengfei, the billionaire founder of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei - admitted misleading US investigators about Huawei's business dealings in Iran. She spent three years under house arrest in Canada while fighting extradition to the United States. Speaking after the executive's release, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the charges against Ms Meng were fabricated. State media quoted Hua Chunying as saying the case was ""act of political persecution against Chinese citizens"". Meng Wanzhou is on her way back here full of praise and thanks for what she called ""the motherland"" and China's ruling Communist Party, a party that her employer Huawei has gone to extraordinary lengths to try to distance itself from. She admitted misleading US investigators about her involvement in payments over business in Iran. As soon as her freedom was assured, China released the two Canadians it's held since days after her arrest. Whether it's a deal or a domino effect is not clear, but only weeks ago the Chinese government insisted yet again the two cases were not linked. ""Different in nature,"" it said. The decision to release and send home Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig almost instantly after Meng Wanzhou was free to go appears to show that pretence has been abandoned. Mr Kovrig is a former diplomat employed by International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. Mr Spavor is a founding member of an organisation that facilitates international business and cultural ties with North Korea. In August this year a Chinese court sentenced Mr Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage. There had been no decision in Mr Kovrig's case. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said his country was ""pleased"" by the Chinese move, but added that the men had suffered ""more than two-and-a-half years of arbitrary detention"". Earlier on Friday, a Canadian judge ordered the release of Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, after she reached a deal with US prosecutors over fraud charges against her. ""Over the past three years my life has been turned upside down,"" she told reporters outside the Vancouver courthouse. ""Every cloud has a silver lining,"" she continued. ""I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world."" Later in a post on social media she thanked the Communist Party, the Chinese government and the ""motherland"". Meanwhile Huawei released a statement, in which it said it looked forward to seeing Ms Meng reunited with her family and saying it would continue to defend itself in court. This video can not be played ""My life has been turned upside down,"" Ms Meng tells reporters after being freed from Canadian detention Before her arrest, US prosecutors accused Ms Meng of fraud, alleging that she misled banks into processing transactions for Huawei that broke US sanctions against Iran. As part of a deferred prosecution agreement, Ms Meng admitted to misleading HSBC about Huawei's relationship with Skycom, a Hong-Kong based company that operated in Iran. The US justice department said in a statement that it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei, which is still on a trade blacklist. Ms Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. He also served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei itself is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. It has faced accusations that Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban.

"US sportswear giant Nike and US retail giant Costco both say they are facing product shortages and delays due to global supply chain problems. Nike said production and delivery of its shoes would impacted until next spring, as it struggles with shipping issues and a worker shortage in Asia. Meanwhile, Costco has re-imposed limits on items like toilet paper. It says customers are stockpiling again amid Covid fears, but it is also struggling to ship goods to its shops. On Thursday, Nike said it had cut its sales outlook for the year due to the ongoing disruption. ""We are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the [manufacturing] and movement of product around the world,"" chief financial officer Matthew Friend said. ""We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors."" Record backlog of cargo ships at California ports The firm's factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, which make three quarters of its shoes, have been hit by local lockdowns. In Vietnam alone it has cost the firm 10 weeks of production this year. Meanwhile, the time it takes to get its products from Asia to North America has doubled, from around 40 to 80 days. Nike has also seen transit times rise in North America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa due to ""port and rail congestion and labour shortages"". Costco - a membership only retailer - said on Thursday it was reinstating limits on purchases of key items including toilet rolls, bottled water and some cleaning products. It said it was partly due to a resurgence in panic buying, but it is also struggling to find trucks, drivers and shipping containers to get goods to its stores. The retailer has even chartered three of its own ocean liners to move products between Asia and North America over the coming year. ""The factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, Covid disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labour cost pressures and truck and driver shortages,"" said Costco's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti. ""Various major brands are requesting longer lead times, and in some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice"". Since economies have reopened, retailers around the world have faced widespread disruption amid a surge in demand for imports. In the US it's contributed to shortages of children's toys, timber, new clothes and pet food, while also pushing up consumer prices. Brands including toymaker Hasbro and sportswear giant Adidas have warned of potential supply bottlenecks going into the crucial holiday season. And last week, a record 73 ships were forced to queue outside two major US ports, Long Beach and Los Angeles, as port staff scrambled to clear the backlog. Before Covid, it was unusual for more than one to wait for a berth.

"The government is taking a number of steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers, amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas. It hasintroduced temporary visasfor 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. The shortage of HGV drivers is due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. TheAnnual Population Survey,externalproduced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that there were 16,000 fewer EU nationals working as HGV drivers in the year ending March 2021, than in the previous year. Even before Covid, the overall estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. Covid is certainly part of the problem. As travel became increasingly restricted last year, and large parts of the economy shut down, many European drivers went home. And haulage companies say very few have returned. The pandemic also created a large backlog in HGV driver tests, so it has been impossible to get enough new drivers up and running. The industrywarned the prime minister,externalin June that there were 25,000 fewer candidates passing their test in 2020 than in 2019. There are HGV driver shortages across Europe, but in the UK Brexit has made things worse. Many European drivers who went back to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere, are unable to return. When the UK was part of the EU single market, they used to be able to come and go as they pleased. But new immigration rules mean that is no longer the case. There is also new bureaucracy, and the decline in the value of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote has made working in the UK less attractive for EU nationals. The strain on the freight transport system comes before Britain imposes checks on goods coming in from the EU. They have now been delayed until next year - some in January, others in July. If they prove too intrusive, that could make it even more difficult to encourage European drivers to work in this country. Many drivers are paid by the mile or kilometre rather than by the hour, so delays cost them money. There have also been tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. The reform of the IR35 rules - on how people working off the payroll pay tax - are designed to prevent workers setting up limited companies and paying less tax and National Insurance while working, in effect, as an employee. Haulage companies say the average age of HGV drivers in the UK is 55, and they want more to be done to attract younger workers. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? Backlash against longer hours for lorry drivers That includes better terms and conditions, better facilities for long distance drivers to use, and a recognition that they are a vital part of the economy. One consequence of shortages, though, has been thatsome wages for driversare already going up. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. As well as allowing more foreign workers into the UK, Ministry of Defence examiners will be brought in to increase the number of HGV driving tests. There will befree intensive 'boot camps',externalto train 5,000 people to become HGV drivers, with another 1,000 to be trained through courses funded by the adult education budget. The government is also writing to nearly one million drivers who hold an HGV licence to encourage them to return to the industry. There have been warnings about fruit and vegetable deliveries because of driver shortages It has also slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. There is Â£7,000 per person funding for the Large Goods Vehicle Driver apprenticeship scheme. Andthe government is consultingon a temporary weakening of the rules on what is called cabotage. Cabotage refers to whether a foreign HGV driver arriving in the UK is allowed to make collections and deliveries in the country before returning to their own countries. It's proposing to allow unlimited deliveries in a 14-day period. The Road Haulage Associationopposes this,external, because it will mean non-UK haulage companies can take work in the UK, as opposed to foreign HGV drivers working for UK haulage companies.

"The government has confirmed plans to speed up the process of obtaining an HGV driver licence, amid a nationwide shortage of drivers. Up to 50,000 more HGV driving tests will be made available each year by shortening the application process and the tests themselves, it said. The UK faces a shortfall of around 90,000 drivers, which has hit the supply of food, petrol and other goods. However, industry groups said the new plans did not go far enough. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Government to shorten HGV driver testing process Lorry driver shortages have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. There have also beencomplaints about a backlog of driver tests. In a written statement to the House of Commons,external, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would now overhaul regulations to boost capacity, meaning: Car drivers will no longer need to take a separate test to tow a trailer or caravan, allowing roughly 30,000 more HGV tests to be conducted every year Tests will be made shorter by removing several elements and having them tested separately by a third party Drivers will be able to get a licence to drive an articulated vehicle without first getting one for a smaller vehicle, making around 20,000 more HGV driving tests available every year. Mr Shapps said the changes, which still need to be approved by parliament, will generate additional test capacity ""very rapidly"". He added: ""These changes will not change the standard of driving required to drive an HGV, with road safety continuing to be of paramount importance."" Industry groups are sceptical about the plans - elements of which were published earlier this week - warning that they could affect safety. They also reiterated calls for temporary work visas to woo back around 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry - something the government has rejected. More than 6,300 lorry drivers spent Christmas 2020 queuing to enter the Port of Dover when France closed its border with the UK ""This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem,"" Paul Jackson, managing director of Peterborough-based cold and chilled food logistics firm Chiltern Distribution told the BBC on Thursday. ""We don't put newly-qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first eight to 10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. ""We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad."" Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week and it would take nearly two years to fill the net shortfall. A host of companies have been hit by the driver shortage, while some are offering higher wages and retention bonuses to woo recruits. SupermarketMorrisons has warned the crisis will push up prices, while restaurant chainNando's temporarily closed 50 sites, blaming supply chain issues. And BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites, due to not being able to get petrol and diesel to them. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Sir Keir Starmer has been forced to drop changes to the way Labour elects its leaders after they were rejected by the party's left wing. He had wanted to scrap one-member-one vote - but opponents said that would give Labour MPs too much say over who gets the top job. Sir Keir is now hoping to get members to back a watered-down package of reforms in a conference vote on Sunday. He says they will help the party win the next general election. The row over Labour's constitution began earlier this week, when the leader proposed changing the way his successors would be chosen. Labour launches conference with fair pay promise People wrongly assume Sir Keir is posh - top aide Labour: Has Starmer stood by his pledges? He had wanted to replace the current one-member-one-vote system with an ""electoral college"" system - abolished by predecessor Ed Miliband - under which Labour members would only account for a third of the votes in a future leadership contest. MPs and unions would also each have made up a third of the votes. But Sir Keir had to drop his proposals after he failed to persuade the big Labour-backing unions to support them. Activist group Momentum called the proposed rule change ""an MP veto by the backdoor"", adding: ""Handing this much power to a Westminster elite is the opposite of democracy."" Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) approved a diluted package of reforms earlier on Saturday, but they will also need to be agreed by party members. The package includes: A rule that any candidate would need the backing of 20% of party MPs to get onto the leadership ballot - up from the current 10% Increasing the percentage of local party members needed to trigger a reselection process for their MP - up to 50% from a third Scrapping registered supporters - where voters can pay a one-off fee to vote in the leadership election Another rule where people will have to have been a party member for six months before they can vote for a leader These new plans were agreed by 22 votes to 12. Speaking after the meeting at the party's conference in Brighton, Sir Keir said: ""I'm very pleased these party reforms have got the backing of our NEC. ""These proposals put us in a better position to win the next general election and I hope constituency and trade union delegates will support them when they come to conference floor."" Sir Keir Starmer has got to project himself to sceptical voters outside the conference hall, but it looks as though internal rows will dominate this weekend. He got the backing of his ruling national executive for a watered down package of reforms. But it is still a very significant package of reforms. For example, in future leadership contests, in order to get onto the ballot in the first place, candidates will need the backing of 20% of MPs instead of 10%. That may sound like a boring procedural change, but to put it into context, it would have meant last time round that Sir Keir would have been the only candidate and it would have prevented Jeremy Corbyn getting on the ballot in the first place. Labour's left are absolutely infuriated by this and when it is debated on the conference floor, they will resist it. So, while Sir Keir may want the story of the conference to focus on his efforts to be in touch with working people, it could be overshadowed by this row. What's going on with Labour's row? Sir Keir and predecessor Jeremy Corbyn were both elected under the one-member-one vote system - but plans to scrap it were seen on the left as an attempt to stop another radical left-wing candidate, like Mr Corbyn, winning the leadership again. And unions seen as sympathetic to the party leader failed to back the proposals on Friday, meaning they could not go to a full vote at conference. A source close to Sir Keir said that the leadership election reforms had not been presented to the party as ""a take-it-or-leave-it deal"", adding: ""That's how we've approached it and we're pleased with where we've ended up."" Conference also voted by 59% 41% to keep David Evans, an ally of Sir Keir, as Labour's general secretary. Many on the left had wanted to remove him and there were chants of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" within the hall as Mr Evans addressed delegates before the ballot was held.

"EVCL Chill Ltd delivered food to retailers including Asda and Sainsbury's More than 400 jobs are at risk as a firm which delivers chilled food to major supermarkets across the UK called in administrators. EVCL Chill Ltd, which has headquarters in Alfreton, Derbyshire, delivers food to retailers including Asda and Sainsbury's. Administrators PwC said acute driver shortages had added to its challenges. The firm said 650 employees had been transferred ""to key customers"" but the remaining staff's future was ""unclear"". It comes as the government prepares to bring in a temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to work in the UK toaddress a HGV driver shortage. Privately-owned EVCL Chill has sites across the UK including Daventry, Rochdale, Crick and Penrith, and employed more than 1,000 staff in warehousing and HGV driving roles. It said it would be arranging meetings with those staff affected on Monday. PwC said all operations including transportation have ""successfully been transferred or ceased"". The administration does not affect the wider EV Cargo Group which continues to trade as before, PwC said. In the period up to December 2020 turnover exceeded Â£167m but EVCL Chill said it has struggled with a loss of key customers and acute driver shortages this year, PwC said. It said a ""number of sale options were explored but generated limited interest"" and management decided to enter into administration. ""This has been a very difficult situation. As businesses move from survival mode to recovery, the financial climate is still very volatile,"" Eddie Williams, joint administrator, said. ""I am pleased at least 658 roles will continue in a sector that is already facing many difficulties and challenges. ""We will continue to fully support all affected staff members during this difficult time.""

MPs and unions would also each have made up a third of the votes. But Sir Keir had to drop his proposals after he failed to persuade the big Labour-backing unions to support them. Activist group Momentum called the proposed rule change ""an MP veto by the backdoor"", adding: ""Handing this much power to a Westminster elite is the opposite of democracy."" Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) approved a diluted package of reforms earlier on Saturday, but they will also need to be agreed by party members. The package includes: A rule that any candidate would need the backing of 20% of party MPs to get onto the leadership ballot - up from the current 10% Increasing the percentage of local party members needed to trigger a reselection process for their MP - up to 50% from a third Scrapping registered supporters - where voters can pay a one-off fee to vote in the leadership election Another rule where people will have to have been a party member for six months before they can vote for a leader These new plans were agreed by 22 votes to 12. Speaking after the meeting at the party's conference in Brighton, Sir Keir said: ""I'm very pleased these party reforms have got the backing of our NEC. ""These proposals put us in a better position to win the next general election and I hope constituency and trade union delegates will support them when they come to conference floor."" Sir Keir Starmer has got to project himself to sceptical voters outside the conference hall, but it looks as though internal rows will dominate this weekend. He got the backing of his ruling national executive for a watered down package of reforms. But it is still a very significant package of reforms. For example, in future leadership contests, in order to get onto the ballot in the first place, candidates will need the backing of 20% of MPs instead of 10%. That may sound like a boring procedural change, but to put it into context, it would have meant last time round that Sir Keir would have been the only candidate and it would have prevented Jeremy Corbyn getting on the ballot in the first place. Labour's left are absolutely infuriated by this and when it is debated on the conference floor, they will resist it. So, while Sir Keir may want the story of the conference to focus on his efforts to be in touch with working people, it could be overshadowed by this row. What's going on with Labour's row? Sir Keir and predecessor Jeremy Corbyn were both elected under the one-member-one vote system - but plans to scrap it were seen on the left as an attempt to stop another radical left-wing candidate, like Mr Corbyn, winning the leadership again. And unions seen as sympathetic to the party leader failed to back the proposals on Friday, meaning they could not go to a full vote at conference. A source close to Sir Keir said that the leadership election reforms had not been presented to the party as ""a take-it-or-leave-it deal"", adding: ""That's how we've approached it and we're pleased with where we've ended up."" Conference also voted by 59% 41% to keep David Evans, an ally of Sir Keir, as Labour's general secretary. Many on the left had wanted to remove him and there were chants of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" within the hall as Mr Evans addressed delegates before the ballot was held.

"Chloe Clem's disapproving look has become an internet sensation An image of a popular internet meme, featuring a two-year-old girl, has been sold as a non-fungible token (NFT) for about $74,000 (Â£54,000). The picture, dubbed Side Eyeing Chloe, shows young Chloe Clem giving a disapproving look after her mother reveals a surprise trip to Disneyland. NFTs are digital tokens which demonstrate ownership of electronic art. The Clem family auctioned their NFT for 25 Ethereum - a form of cryptocurrency. It was bought by 3F Music, a Dubai-based music production company. The firm has not responded to BBC enquiries. NFTs are typically bought and sold for cryptocurrency. Despite owning the digital certificate, buyers do not control the copyright for the image it represents. What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? Chloe's mother, Katie, told the BBC she and her family watched the auction from their home in Utah, and were delighted with the sale. ""If we're going based off meme sales before, it's a bit lower, but we're so grateful for what it sold for,"" said Katie. ""The money is awesome but it's just the fact that we get to do this as a family is so much fun."" NFTs of internet memes have attracted millions of dollars in sales this year. In February an NFT of Nyan Cat, another storied internet sensation, was sold by the image's creator for 300 Ethereum, worth more than $880,000. The NFT of Side Eyeing Chloe was taken from the original video, posted on YouTube by Chloe's mother Katie in 2013. The video shows Chloe announcing that the family are going to Disneyland. One of the girls, Lily, starts crying, and the camera pans to Chloe as she pulls a reproachful face. Chloe Clem, now 10, and her mother Katie The video of Chloe, who's now aged 10, has been watched more than 20 million times. Chloe has also amassed over 500,000 followers on Instagram, and has been featured in a Google advert in Brazil. Ms Clem said that for now, they're planning to save the Ethereum from the sale. ""In an ever-changing world, it may be worth more next week,"" she said, referring to the cryptocurrency's volatile price. But the family have plans for some of it in the near future. ""We'll definitely get a Walt Disney holiday out of this next year!"" This video can not be played Digital-only artwork by Beeple sold for $69m (Â£50m) Demand for NFTs has recently boomed, with some selling for millions of dollars in high-profile auctions. In March, a collection of NFTs by artist Beeple wassold at auction house Christie's for $69m ($50m). The same month, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold an NFT of his first-ever tweet for more than $2.9m. Critics say the digital tokens have a huge environmental impact.

"US sportswear giant Nike and US retail giant Costco both say they are facing product shortages and delays due to global supply chain problems. Nike said production and delivery of its shoes would impacted until next spring, as it struggles with shipping issues and a worker shortage in Asia. Meanwhile, Costco has re-imposed limits on items like toilet paper. It says customers are stockpiling again amid Covid fears, but it is also struggling to ship goods to its shops. On Thursday, Nike said it had cut its sales outlook for the year due to the ongoing disruption. ""We are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the [manufacturing] and movement of product around the world,"" chief financial officer Matthew Friend said. ""We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors."" Record backlog of cargo ships at California ports The firm's factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, which make three quarters of its shoes, have been hit by local lockdowns. In Vietnam alone it has cost the firm 10 weeks of production this year. Meanwhile, the time it takes to get its products from Asia to North America has doubled, from around 40 to 80 days. Nike has also seen transit times rise in North America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa due to ""port and rail congestion and labour shortages"". Costco - a membership only retailer - said on Thursday it was reinstating limits on purchases of key items including toilet rolls, bottled water and some cleaning products. It said it was partly due to a resurgence in panic buying, but it is also struggling to find trucks, drivers and shipping containers to get goods to its stores. The retailer has even chartered three of its own ocean liners to move products between Asia and North America over the coming year. ""The factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, Covid disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials and ingredients, labour cost pressures and truck and driver shortages,"" said Costco's chief financial officer, Richard Galanti. ""Various major brands are requesting longer lead times, and in some cases, difficulty in finding drivers and trucks on short notice"". Since economies have reopened, retailers around the world have faced widespread disruption amid a surge in demand for imports. In the US it's contributed to shortages of children's toys, timber, new clothes and pet food, while also pushing up consumer prices. Brands including toymaker Hasbro and sportswear giant Adidas have warned of potential supply bottlenecks going into the crucial holiday season. And last week, a record 73 ships were forced to queue outside two major US ports, Long Beach and Los Angeles, as port staff scrambled to clear the backlog. Before Covid, it was unusual for more than one to wait for a berth.

"Meng Wanzhou (C) leaves British Columbia Supreme Court A Chinese technology executive held in Canada on US fraud charges has left the country after a deal with prosecutors, following years of diplomatic tensions over her fate. Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, was detained on fraud charges in December 2018 at the request of the US. On Friday, the US Department of Justice dropped an extradition request for her. The case infuriated China and strained relations with the US and Canada. It also prompted accusations that China had detained Canadian citizens in retaliation, which China denied. ""My life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me,"" Ms Meng told reporters after being freed from Canadian detention. ""Every cloud has a silver lining,"" she continued, adding: ""I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world."" Shortly afterwards she boarded an Air China flight bound for the Chinese city of Shenzhen, AFP news agency reports. Meng Wanzhou is believed to have left Vancouver International Airport on this Air China flight bound for Shenzhen Details of a possible deal for Ms Meng's release have been the subject of intense negotiations between US and Chinese diplomats. The US alleged Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran. On Friday the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement. This means the DOJ would hold off from prosecuting Ms Meng until December 2022. If she complied with conditions set by court, the case would eventually be dropped. The PowerPoint that sparked an international row Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress The deal, which recommended she be released, allowed her to formally deny guilt for key charges while also acknowledging the allegations laid out by the Americans. Later on Friday, Canadian prosecutors told a court in Vancouver that they had withdrawn efforts to extradite her to the US and that she should be discharged from detention. She had been under house arrest in her multimillion-dollar Vancouver home for nearly three years. Ahead of the court appearance, Ms Meng was seen entering the building accompanied by Chinese consular officials. The judge subsequently ordered that she go free. As part of the deal, Ms Meng agreed to a ""statement of facts"" admitting that she knowingly made false statements to HSBC. The DOJ said Ms Meng had ""taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution"". The DOJ also said said it was continuing to prepare for trial against Huawei. For months there have been extensive behind-the-scenes contacts, with senior Huawei executives sent to Washington by the company to try to resolve a case which has fuelled international tension. For Huawei's boss, the issue has been deeply personal, with his daughter being held, but for the whole of China it has also turned into a major cause of anger. It has also poisoned relations between China and Canada, with the latter believing two of its citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been held as pawns in the negotiations. A deal has the ability to reduce some of the tensions that have emerged. But there will still be questions - what does the US gain out of it? And what kind of link might there be between events in North America and the status of the two Michaels in China? Ms Meng is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei, who set up Huawei in 1987. The company is now the largest telecom equipment maker in the world. He served in the Chinese army for nine years, until 1983, and is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei has faced accusations that the Chinese authorities could use its equipment for espionage - allegations it denies. In 2019, the US imposed sanctions on Huawei and placed it on an export blacklist, cutting it off from key technologies. The UK, Sweden, Australia and Japan have also banned Huawei, while other countries including France and India have adopted measures stopping short of an outright ban. A few days after Ms Meng was arrested, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on suspicion of spying. Critics have accused China of treating them as political bargaining chips, held as part of what is known as ""hostage diplomacy"". China denies this. Last month, a Chinese court convicted Michael Spavor, a businessman, of espionage and sentenced him to 11 years in prison. Canada condemned the sentence, saying his trial did not satisfy even the minimum standards required by international law. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated Ms Meng's agreement with the US may pave the way for the two Canadians' release, but tensions in China-Canada relations will not quickly dissipate, experts say. The bilateral relationship has plunged to historic lows since Meng's arrest. The US charges against Huawei remain, and the company is still on a trade blacklist. Other Chinese tech companies with operations in the US, such as social media company TikTok, are also facing scrutiny. Chinese tech sector analyst Rui Ma told the BBC that many Chinese companies were hopeful that Ms Meng's deal with the US might mean no further deterioration of US-China relations, ""but no one is taking it to mean that there is a reversal in tensions"".

"Drivers encountered lengthy queues at many forecourts on Saturday A temporary visa scheme to make it easier for foreign lorry drivers to work in the UK is set to run for three months, ending on Christmas eve. It is understood about 5,000 visas may be issued, with more details about the scheme set to be announced on Sunday. A shortage of drivers has disrupted fuel deliveries, with some petrol stations closing, and queues forming. The government has said there is no fuel shortage at refineries, and urged people not to panic buy. The president of the AA said panic-buying rather than supply chain issues was driving the shortage of fuel at some petrol stations. Edmund King added that the problem should pass in a matter of days if drivers only fill up when they need it, adding ""there is plenty of fuel at source"". MPs and police forces have called on drivers to be ""sensible"", to consider filling up another time, and to avoid stockpiling fuel in jerry cans. One petrol station boss from Ferndale, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, appealed for calm amidcontinued high demand for fuel on Saturday. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Nike and Costco warn of product shortages and delays Meanwhile, the continued shortage of hauliers threatens more disruption to deliveries of petrol, food and other goods. Trade association Logistics UK estimates that the UK is in need of about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. The foreign drivers eligible for visas will not be limited to the EU, but the expectation is most of the drivers will be from Europe. A raft of longer-term measures. including training up more drivers and addressing the backlog of driving tests, are also to be introduced by ministers. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood welcomed the introduction of the temporary visa but said this would not help overnight. As well as training more domestic drivers and speeding-up testing, Mr Ellwood said hundreds of Afghan refugees could be trained to fill vacancies. Jennifer Ward, a student paramedic, had to travel to five stations to get diesel for her ambulance Jennifer Ward, a student paramedic of three years for Medicare EMS, which provides 999 frontline support to the East of England Ambulance Service, said she had to travel to five stations to get diesel for her ambulance. She was eventually able to use the lorry pumps at a petrol station in Chelmsford. The 21-year-old said: ""No patient care was delayed because of this, ambulances were still being sent to jobs. ""It was more the anxiety of not knowing where we can fill up when you're on three quarters of a tank, I could be sent anywhere, I could be sent to Norwich and I could have had no fuel."" Matt McDonnell, chief executive of Medicare EMS, said a member of staff cancelled their shift on Saturday because they had been unable to get fuel. Ambulance drivers were also struggling to get enough fuel for their shifts, he said. He added: ""If it carries on and gets worse we may be in a situation where we are unable to meet our contractual needs. I'm waiting to see what they [the government] will do about it, whether they will introduce what they did last year for key workers and shopping, or something like that."" Rosie Osborne, a wedding singer, was queuing for petrol in Balham Hill, south London, before travelling to a wedding in Somerset, where she will front the band. ""I'm in the red and I need to get petrol ASAP,"" she said. ""I have been sat in this queue for 50 minutes and I didn't want to risk getting petrol elsewhere en route, but I am nearly on empty so I need to get petrol anyway."" But there was no such pressure for one driver in Leeds who says that, while she only has 21 miles left in her tank, ""I'll just walk or get the bus"" if she can't fill up. One woman, who lives in York, says she had managed to get some fuel on Friday night which she needed to enable her to help her 91-year-old mother who lived in Leeds. ""She would have been stuck,"" she says. ""It's very difficult."" This video can not be played Drivers react to long petrol queues: 'I'm on red and I need to get petrol ASAP' Sainsbury's said it was experiencing ""high demand"" for fuel, with a ""tiny proportion of sites"" temporarily closed. BP said about 20 of its 1,200 petrol forecourts were closed, with between 50 and 100 sites affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel. A ""small number"" of Esso-branded Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted, said Esso's owner ExxonMobil. EG Group, which has 341 petrol stations in the UK, is introducing a limit of Â£30 per customer on all grades of fuel due to ""unprecedented customer demand"". Business minister Greg Hands said fewer than 1% of petrol stations were closed and there was ""easily enough petrol available for normal use at this time of year"". One petrol station in Stockport sold 5,280 gallons (24,000 litres) of fuel on Friday, compared with 1,760 gallons (8,000 litres) on the same day the previous week. This isn't a particularly popular idea with many cabinet ministers. That's because the new immigration system that came in after Brexit was all about saying to companies: ""You can't rely on cheap foreign labour any more, you've got to focus on the workforce in this country, you've got to train them, you've got to pay them better wages."" Relaxing those immigration rules now undermines that message. It could lead to other sectors saying they want special treatment too. Ministers know this situation could get very difficult, very quickly. So they do have to act - even though this is going to cause huge political embarrassment. Labour are already saying - we told you about this, we said this should happen months ago. Boris Johnson knows all too well his opponents are going to be very ready to say: ""We told you so."" The European Road Haulers Association said temporary visas would be a ""good idea"" but are ""only part of the solution"" - and warned staying in the EU may be more appealing for drivers. Allan Davison, managing director of Hoyer Petrolog UK - BP's transport contractor - said temporary visas were needed to ease the current problems. Lorry drivers have said some of the conditions they face in the job were putting off younger recruits - the average age of a HGV driver in the UK is 55. Vehicles queue for fuel at a Sainsbury's petrol station in Weymouth A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages."" The spokesperson said the government was looking at temporary, time-limited measures to introduce. ""We are moving to a high wage, high skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience,"" the spokesperson added.
