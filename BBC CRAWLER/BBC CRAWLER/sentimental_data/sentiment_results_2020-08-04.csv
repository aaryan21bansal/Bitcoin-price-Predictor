"A Spider-Man sculpture seen at a Barcelona gaming festival last year The upcoming Marvel Avengers game has sparked a backlash after it was revealed that Spider-Man will only be in the PlayStation version. Its developer said the web-slinger will be available as downloadable content (DLC) next year on one platform only. The game will be released on 4 September across several platforms including PS4, Xbox One and PC. Fans have suggested the move will see many players missing out on the game's full experience. Sony has owned the movie rights to Spider-Man since 1999, and a video game headlined by the web-slinger - Marvel's Spider-Man - was a PlayStation 4 exclusive in 2018. However, the superhero has appeared in other games on multiple consoles and PC over the years, including titles based on The Amazing Spider-Man film and its 2014 sequel. Why Hollywood needs computer games more than ever Halo Infinite Xbox Series X trailer divides fans Numerous fans shared their outrage on social media following the surprise announcement on Monday. ""As a PS and PC player, I'll just be skipping Avengers altogether now. This is a such a dumb thing to do,""complained one gamer,external. ""I'm a PlayStation person and I still get a bit sad and mad when something like Spider-Man or stuff gets locked to only on PS. Xbox players really should be able to have fun too,""said another,external. Players have labelled the decision ""unfair"" Spider-Man will be made available to PlayStation players at no additional cost, and an in-game event will mark the release. Ludo Medina, co-founder of gaming platform The N-Erd Council, told the BBC that the move would force many gamers to ""pick sides"". ""Exclusives are nothing new when it comes to games, but exclusive characters for specific consoles? This is a whole new territory. ""It is incredibly unfair on them and leaves PC and Xbox hanging out to dry. Gamers are saying it is forcing them to unnecessarily choose between one or the other."" Crystal Dynamics also confirmed the game's first post-launch character addition would be superhero Hawkeye, and would be available across all platforms.

"This video can not be played A Linwood High School pupil is congratulated by his mum after receiving his results Thousands of Scottish school pupils have received worse results than they had been expecting after the country's exam body lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total. Exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers based on the pupil's performance over the school year. However, a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. Many pupils have spoken of their disappointment at being given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams, with some claiming they have suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Opposition politicians have warned that there will now be a ""deluge"" of appeals, and accused the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) of treating the professional judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by changing so many grades. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Live coverage: Results day for Scotland's school pupils How grades were worked out in the year with no exams About 138,000 students began receiving their results at 08:00 on Tuesday. The pass rate for National 5 was 81.1%, while the Higher pass rate was 78.9% and the Advanced Higher rate was 84.9%. In 2019, the National 5 pass rate was 78.2%, the Higher pass rate was 74.8% and the Advanced Higher rate was 79.4%. Most pupils take their Nationals when they are in their fourth year of secondary school. They can then stay at school for another two years and work towards Higher qualifications in their fifth year, and Advanced Highers in sixth year. Scottish school pupils traditionally find out their results earlier than those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who will receive their grades for A-levels on 13 August and GCSEs on 20 August. A total of 133,762 individual results were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) from the 511,070 initial estimates of grades that were submitted by teachers. Of these, only 9,198 of the estimates were adjusted up, while 124,564 were adjusted down. Almost all (96%) were adjusted by a single grade. If the results had purely been based on the estimates from teachers, pass rates at grades A-C would have increased by 10.4 percentage points for National 5, by 14 percentage points for Higher and by 13.4 percentage points for Advanced Higher. These estimated results would have led to a higher annual change than had ever been seen before in Scottish exam results if they had not been moderated by the SQA. SQA figures also showed that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, compared to only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. At National 5 level, the pass rate for the poorest pupils was 74% when teachers' estimates would have led to an 84.5% pass rate without moderation. For the least deprived, the 92.3% estimated pass rate fell to 87.1% after the SQA's moderation. The exams body insisted that the most deprived pupils had not suffered compared to previous years - and the Scottish government said the attainment gap has narrowed this year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher. ""But given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" The SQA said the most disadvantaged pupils had achieved better results this year than in 2019, with the number of passes also above the average for the past four years. A spokesman added: ""At Grades A to C, the attainment gap between the most and least disadvantaged young people is also narrower this year for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher than for last year or the average gap for the last four years."" This video can not be played John Swinney says national moderation played an 'important role' in grades Aiden from Falkirk said he had been predicted to get three As and a B in his Highers but was given a B and 3Cs, and has been encouraged by his teachers to appeal. The 17-year-old told the PA news agency that he believes he was penalised for being from a less affluent area. He added: ""I was very proud of the Scottish education system but after this I am really disappointed. ""I don't know how they can give me a B in modern studies because someone in my area got a B in modern studies at a similar level years ago, I just don't think that's fair."" The teenager also said he felt pupils and teachers had been ""left in the dark"" about how results had been awarded by the SQA, and what the appeals process is. Holyrood Secondary pupil Dionne celebrates her results with her dad John Another pupil, Lewis from Bishopbriggs, was given Bs for English and PE despite getting As in the prelim exams, and a D in computing despite getting a C in the prelim. Lewis said: ""I don't understand why the SQA are deciding our results when our teachers have a much better understanding of our work and progress. ""Even then, there is almost never a reason for moving someone down a grade from their predicted grade - it's been a shambles. ""Our teachers have even been emailing us saying they've not got a clue what's been going on."" But Dionne, a pupil at Holyrood Secondary in Glasgow, told BBC Breakfast that her results had been  ""exactly what I was hoping for"". ""It means I'm going to university and I'm just so happy. I can't believe it,"" she said. Her father John said he was ""so proud"" of his daughter, adding: ""She's done so much better than I could have ever done at school. It's been such a time of uncertainty and it's a massive wait over now.""

""Our advice and support is available and our message is if your results aren't what you expected, don't worry - you have lots of options,"" he said.

As in the rest of the UK, the grades of pupils who were unable to sit exams have been worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. Teachers were asked to place students within bands for each subject, and rank their pupils in order. These assessments were then checked by the SQA, which said grades had been moderated ""where appropriate"" to ""maintain national standards"". The SQA said it had sought to ""uphold the integrity and credibility"" of the system in its moderation, but that its efforts had been focused on ""ensuring fairness for all learners"". The exams body also said it would look at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment, but denied that a school's previous record could put pupils at either an advantage or a disadvantage. Where a pupil receives a lower grade than the one estimated by their teacher or lecturer, they will be able to usea free appeals process,external. You can read more about how the grades were calculated here The SQA gave many pupils lower grades than had been estimated for them by teachers Scottish Labour has accused the SQA of treating the judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by lowering the grades of so many pupils - which can damage their prospects for university or college. The party's education spokesman, Iain Gray, said: ""Worst of all, the SQA have done this on the basis of each school's past performance, marking the school not the pupil, and baking in the attainment gap. ""They were told that this would be grossly unfair and it is. The SQA will now be deluged with appeals. I hope they are ready to deal with them properly."" The Scottish Conservatives criticised the ""shambolic"" handling of the process by the SQA, and said it ""must honour its commitment and release the methodology it used to assess and award qualifications"". Its education spokesman, Jamie Greene, said: ""Without proper transparency the Scottish public will not have confidence in the process."" And Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens claimed that ""pupils are having their futures disadvantaged and it seems to be for no other reason than they school they go to"". He added: ""How can the SQA say the system is based on teacher judgement when in some schools they have ignored almost every professional judgement that teachers have made?"" The first minister said pupils deserved ""enormous credit"" for the way they had coped after exams were cancelled across the UK as schools closed and the country went into lockdown in March. Ms Sturgeon added: ""At a moment's notice you had to adapt to new forms of learning, your contact with friends and family was restricted, many of you missed out on a proper end to your final year, you didn't get to sit exams. ""Of course, you're now having to think about your future in a time of real economic uncertainty. ""All of that has been really tough and we don't underestimate how tough that has been, and I know that for some of you there will be difficult decisions that lie ahead.""

"Pizza Express is considering closing 67 of its UK restaurants, which would mean the loss of 1,100 jobs. The chain is the latest High Street outlet to undertake a restructuring of its business after trading was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. The news comes just a day after the government launched its Eat Out to Help Out plan to boost the restaurant trade. Pizza Express would not say which of its 449 UK outlets were possible targets for closure. It currently has 166 restaurants open, all of which are taking part in Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Â£10 off meal deal. All its UK outlets had been closed since lockdown began on 23 March. They began reopening in July when lockdown rules were eased. Pizza Express said in Tuesday's statement that customer demand had been ""encouraging"" at the restaurants which had reopened and that plans for further re-openings were well underway. The company said restructuring the business would put it on a stronger financial footing in the new socially distanced environment. If all 67 outlets are closed, that would mean the loss of 15% of its restaurants, but it said the final outcome was yet to be decided. The big problem for Pizza Express has been its huge debts. More than one billion pounds worth, a sum which was unsustainable. The payments to service its borrowing wiped out its profits over the last two years. A major restructuring has been in the offing for more than a year, long before the pandemic loomed. Debt has been the serial killer for so many companies, from Carillion to Thomas Cook. Unlike a lot of its rivals, 95% of its restaurants are understood to be profitable. The hope is this plan will be enough to strengthen Pizza Express's finances and put it on a more secure footing. But it will probably fall into the hands of its lenders as a result unless a buyer comes forward. Zoe Bowley, UK and Ireland managing director for Pizza Express, said that while the financial restructuring would be a ""positive step forward"", the closures would be ""incredibly sad for our Pizza Express family and we will do everything we can to support our teams at this time"". Many took to social media to comment. Some blamed investors for being greedy, while others said High Street chains needed more help: Allow Twitter content?

Previously, Pizza Express has said the majority of its restaurants are profitable. Pizza Express has heavy debts and last year was known to have started talks to put its debts of more than Â£1bn on more favourable terms. It is expected to announce a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) in the near future, which is an insolvency procedure that allows a company with debt problems to reach agreement with creditors regarding payment of all, or part of its debts. 1965:Pizza Express founder, the late Peter Boizot, brought a pizza oven from Napoli and a chef from Sicily to open his first restaurant in London's Soho. 1992:Mr Boizot grew his empire over the following almost-three decades before selling it for Â£15m to Hugh Osmond and Luke Johnson, the man who was - until recently - chairman of Patisserie Valerie. They floated it on the stock market the next year and ultimately sold out in 1997 when it was worth Â£150m. 2003:It was taken private again in a Â£278m deal by two private equity firms who then floated it two years later - although it lasted less than a year on the public markets before it was returned to private equity hands. 2014:It changed hands again, this time to be acquired for Â£900m by its current owner, Chinese private equity house Hony Capital. 2020:It has more than 600 restaurants globally: 454 in the UK, including five franchises; 19 in Ireland; 24 in Hong Kong; 6 in Singapore; 14 in UAE; 60 in China; and 49 other international sites operated by franchisees. Andy Pellington, group chief finance officer at Pizza Express, said: ""While we have had to make some very difficult decisions, none of which has been taken lightly, we are confident in the actions being taken to reduce the level of debt, create a more focused business and improve the operational performance, all of which puts us in a much stronger position."" Julian Cox, partner at law firm BLM said: ""Pizza Express is yet another household name that has been pushed to the brink by Covid-19. ""Whilst the government has attempted to encourage people through the doors with 'Eat Out to Help Out', the initiative is clearly not going to be enough to protect the sector in the long term."" We're only a few days into August, and already nearly 4,500 jobs have been lost as the furlough scheme starts to wind down.

"Liam Fox was a former trade minister in government Documents on UK-US trade talks, leaked before the 2019 election, were stolen from the personal email account of Tory MP Liam Fox, the BBC understands. Sources revealed on Mondaythat the papers had come from the former minister's account, but not which address the hackers had targeted. The papers were published online and used byLabour in the 2019 campaignto claim the NHS would be put at risk. It is not clear that Mr Fox's use of a personal account was a breach of rules. Cabinet Office advice published in 2013 says MPs are provided with access to government email systems, but ""other forms of electronic communication may be used in the course of conducting government business"". A criminal inquiry into the leaking of the documents is under way, being led by the National Crime Agency. The BBC understands the investigation has been underway since at least the end of last year. Russian hackers stole papers from Liam Fox email Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim The UK government has said Russians almost certainlysought to interfere in the electionthrough the documents. A spokesman for the National Crime Agency confirmed it was leading the investigation, but added he could not comment further. Mr Fox was international trade secretary from July 2016 to July 2019. Last month,he was nominated as the UK government's choice to lead the World Trade Organization, although the new director general has yet to be named. Reuters, whichfirst reported,externalthe story on Monday, said hackers accessed Mr Fox's account multiple times between 12 July and 21 October last year. On Tuesday, a source told the BBC's Gordon Corera the documents had been stolen from Mr Fox's personal account. Reuters has reported thatthe entire contents of Mr Fox's account was taken,external. Responding to Monday's story, a government spokesperson said: ""There is an ongoing criminal investigation into how the documents were acquired, and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this point. ""But as you would expect, the government has very robust systems in place to protect the IT systems of officials and staff."" Last month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had ""reasonable confidence"" that Russian actors had tried to interfere in the December 2019 general election. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election He told the BBC they had sought to ""spread online, illegally obtained, leaked government documents"" around the UK-US trade negotiations for after the country leaves the EU. Mr Raab said the government would ""reserve the right to take the appropriate action"" when the criminal investigation concluded. The UK government was later criticised in a report from the Intelligence and Security Committee -known as the ""Russia report""- for having ""badly underestimated"" the threat the country posed. The mystery of the ""trade leaks"" is slowly being revealed - though still not completely. The 2019 general election now looks like it was the target of what is known a ""hack and leak"" operation, similar - though not on the same scale - as the one Russian military intelligence launched in the 2016 US presidential election. Last month, the government said it believed Russian actors were responsible for spreading the trade document on social media. But there was still the question of how it was first obtained. Now, we know it came from a hack of an email account belonging to Liam Fox. The exact identity of the Russian group behind the attack remains murky. Whether it was the same group which then spread the document is unclear and that group (codenamed Secondary Infektion) is not thought to be the same as the one behind events in the US election, which had a larger impact. Hackers from many countries have targeted politicians in recent years. But coming soon after the Russia report, this will serve as a reminder that groups based in Russia are often the most adept at not just stealing, but also using, the information. Responding to reports of the hack on Mr Fox's email, a spokesperson for the National Cyber Security Centre said on Monday, it works closely with MPs and political parties to offer them ""the best cyber security guidance and support."" ""We have worked closely with political parties for several years on how to protect and defend against cyber attacks - including publishing advice on our website. ""There is an ongoing criminal investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.""

David ShanksBBC Scotland reporter The Hawthorn Bar will be temporarily closing The number of cases of coronavirus linked to an Aberdeen pub has risen to 32 after the first minister issued a warning about the outbreak. 120 people have been contacted by Test and Protect teams. This is down from yesterday, but only because three people were instead included in the list of positive tests. Dr Emmanual Okpo from NHS Grampian says they're working to find everyone connected: ""Every individual who has received a detected result, we will contact. They should just be patient, and sit at home, self isolate, and we will get to them."" Several pubs in Aberdeen have announced closures, including Hawthorn Bar where this cluster originated. Director at Siberia bar, Stuart McPhee, told us today they will be closing. He said: ""There are so many variables that there is an element of risk. We manage our own risk and that at the moment is deemed to be too high."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Larry Flanagan, general
secretary of Scotlandâs largest teachers union the EIS, says many teachers who have had estimates overturned are angry. While the appeals process might address some anomalies, ""a number of teachers will feel their estimates have been undermined by a computer"", he says. When schools mark assessments themselves there can be ""a bit of positive bias"",  Mr Flanagan says, but not to the extent that it would change an entire grade. He expects everyone
whose estimate has not been upheld will be making  appeals, and if those are upheld, it would place ""a huge question"" over the SQA's modelling. Ainsley Dougan shared with us how she felt on her exam results day, explaining she was ""prepared for the worst"". Ainsley left school after fifth year and went on to college, before starting her own personal training business. She also had some tough advice for her former self about school and exams.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney reiterates that 75% of teacher estimates were accepted. But had they all been accepted there would have been questions about the increase in pass rates, he says. ""Fairness to all learners was at the heart of the approach that was selected so that regardless of your circumstances around the country, you would be treated with fairness,"" the deputy first minister insists. These are a set of results which are robust, command confidence and ensure the generation of 2020 can say their results have equal validity to others, he says. On appeals, Mr Swinney confirms those who need grades to get into college or university in September will be prioritised. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Iain Gray, Scottish Labourâs education spokesman, said the SQA and John Swinney were warned not to downgrade results
based on historic performance of their school ""and that is exactly what they have
done"". While students and
teachers have risen to the challenge of a very difficult year, he says, many pupils have been ""ill-served"" by the moderation scheme
the SQA used. ""If we have a system of
teacher assessments, we have to trust those teacher assessments, as has
happened in other countries like France,"" says Mr Gray. Pupils in more deprived areas were
twice as likely to have their grades reduced than contemporaries in
schools in better-off parts of Scotland, he ventures. We cannot get away from the fundamental unfairness that if you are a pupil at a school which historically has not done well, that has been used to downgrade your results. The reality of that for individuals is significant.â Iain Gray MSP, Scottish Labour Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Xander from Drumchapel received 3 As and 2 Bs in his Highers today, but was predicted to get all As by his teachers. He says: ""It is a bit annoying because I know if I'd taken the exam I would have got an A in it."" He believes he was marked down because of how his school as a whole has performed in previous years. His mum Helen adds: ""I don't think the kids should be penalised because of where they come from."" Erin Bartley, who has been answering calls to the Skills Development Scotland helpline all day, says she has heard of ""a lot of anomalies"" relating to prelim grades versus final grades. She says many are therefore planning to appeal. The World Health Organization has urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19 after the country said it would begin vaccinations in October. ""Sometimes individual researchers claim they have found something, which is of course, as such, great news,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters on Tuesday. ""But between finding or having a clue of maybe having a vaccine that works, and having gone through all the stages, is a big difference."" Last week, the Russian government announced it was preparing to begin mass vaccinations. However, the Russian vaccine is not among the WHO's list of six vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials, which involve more widespread testing in humans.

Jane, a biology tutor
from Hamilton, says many of her pupils have been left devastated. ""Unfortunately because some schools are not performing well in STEM subjects, they have had their marks downgraded,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It is not a fantastic incentive for those who have worked so hard to improve their results."" She says some teenagers may knuckle down, but others will just give up. ""I've spoken to some

One Edinburgh pupil, Kirsty, was awarded two As in Higher
Spanish and Advanced Higher Maths. But she did not pass Advanced Higher French â
despite receiving a C in preliminary exams. She said she canât work out how SQA have calculated that
grade. She was predicted 3 As in October and said she was quite shocked when
she receive her grades this morning. She said: âA majority of my class were native speakers so I
know that in a ranking of the class I would be quite far down the list but I
know I would have improved from the prelim (which I passed) to the final exam
and I am quite disappointed, especially as I have achieved straight As all
through school.â Kirsty is concerned an appeal will not make a difference for
her because the preliminary exam is the only piece of evidence she has under
exam conditions. She said: âThe problem is it is now so exam based. A few years
ago we would have done unit tests throughout the year â now we donât do that.â Thankfully, Kirsty already has an unconditional offer for St Andrews University.

Exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers based on the pupil's performance over the school year. However, a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. Many pupils have spoken of their disappointment at being given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams, with some claiming they have suffered because they are from less affluent areas.

"A Spider-Man sculpture seen at a Barcelona gaming festival last year The upcoming Marvel Avengers game has sparked a backlash after it was revealed that Spider-Man will only be in the PlayStation version. Its developer said the web-slinger will be available as downloadable content (DLC) next year on one platform only. The game will be released on 4 September across several platforms including PS4, Xbox One and PC. Fans have suggested the move will see many players missing out on the game's full experience. Sony has owned the movie rights to Spider-Man since 1999, and a video game headlined by the web-slinger - Marvel's Spider-Man - was a PlayStation 4 exclusive in 2018. However, the superhero has appeared in other games on multiple consoles and PC over the years, including titles based on The Amazing Spider-Man film and its 2014 sequel. Why Hollywood needs computer games more than ever Halo Infinite Xbox Series X trailer divides fans Numerous fans shared their outrage on social media following the surprise announcement on Monday. ""As a PS and PC player, I'll just be skipping Avengers altogether now. This is a such a dumb thing to do,""complained one gamer,external. ""I'm a PlayStation person and I still get a bit sad and mad when something like Spider-Man or stuff gets locked to only on PS. Xbox players really should be able to have fun too,""said another,external. Players have labelled the decision ""unfair"" Spider-Man will be made available to PlayStation players at no additional cost, and an in-game event will mark the release. Ludo Medina, co-founder of gaming platform The N-Erd Council, told the BBC that the move would force many gamers to ""pick sides"". ""Exclusives are nothing new when it comes to games, but exclusive characters for specific consoles? This is a whole new territory. ""It is incredibly unfair on them and leaves PC and Xbox hanging out to dry. Gamers are saying it is forcing them to unnecessarily choose between one or the other.""

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning. Pupils in Scotlandhave become the first in the country to receive their resultsunder a system of awarding grades using estimates by teachers, after exams were cancelled due to the pandemic. Overall pass rates in Nationals, Highers and advanced Highers have increased. But opposition politicians are warning there will be a ""deluge"" of appeals after a moderation process saw many grades lowered from their original estimates.

"Zhang Yiming The Chinese head of TikTok has defended plans to sell its US operations, describing a deal as the only way to prevent the app from being banned in the US. In a letter to Chinese staff, Zhang Yiming said the critics do not see the ""full context"". The letter comes as US President Donald Trump has threatened to bar the social media company. Chinese state media have said such pressure amounts to ""theft"". On social media, Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance, has also been described as a ""traitor"". In the letter to staff, which was shared by the company, he acknowledged the criticism, but said ""many people misunderstand the current, complex situation"". He reminded staff of the firm's global ambitions and noted a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, including in the US and India. ""As a company, we have to abide by the laws of the markets where we operate,"" he said. ""It feels like the goal was not necessarily a forced sale, but given the current macro situation, a ban or even more."" Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? How would the US go about banning TikTok? The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok, saying the data it collects from its users - including an estimated 100 million in the US - is at risk of exploitation by the Chinese government. Beijing and TikTok deny those claims, which the US has made against other Chinese tech firms. But a sale to a US company is seen as a way to alleviate such concerns. On Sunday, Microsoft confirmed it was in discussions with ByteDance over buying TikTok's operations in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - countries that make up four of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. On Tuesday, it was reported that Apple is also interested. This video can not be played What's going on with TikTok? When reports of talks between ByteDance - which has received backing from US investors -  and Microsoft surfaced on Friday, Mr Trump said he opposed the deal. But he later appeared to okay a potential sale, saying the government - which would review any takeover by a US company for national security risks - should receive a ""substantial"" cut of any purchase price. Mr Trump has threatened to ban the app on 15 September if there is no deal. ""The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,"" Mr Trump said. Such a demand is highly unorthodox. Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper, said generally ""the government doesn't have the authority to take a cut of a private deal through"" the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the inter-agency committee that reviews some foreign investments in the US. Charlotte Jee, a reporter at MIT Technology Review, a magazine owned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Mr Trump's comments were ""pretty astonishing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""I hate to say this but it is kind of almost Mafia-like behaviour - threatening a ban which pushes down the price then saying 'oh we should get a cut of that deal afterwards to say thank you for what we've done there'. ""It is extraordinary behaviour as well because last week we had lawmakers in the UStrying to look at whether tech companies are too bigand now we've got Trump trying to make one of them even bigger so it is a really, really bizarre situation to be in."" This video can not be played What is TikTok? By Dearbail Jordan, business correspondent Former FBI director James Comey once said that dealing with Donald Trump gave him ""flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob"". The US president has certainly made TikTok an offer it can't refuse. If the video app doesn't break away from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and sell its US operation to Microsoft, Mr Trump will simply ban it - putting TikTok's access to its 80 million active American users in jeopardy. Mr Trump has already flexed his muscles against other Chinese firms, such as Huawei. But what makes the situation with TikTok unprecedented is the demand for a cut of the sale price. The US Treasury has not explained how this extraordinary demand for a cut of a private transaction would work. Mr Trump reckons the government should get a big slice of the pie because ""we're making it possible"". However, the deal wouldn't be happening in the first place but for his administration's claim that the likes of TikTok are feeding users' data directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Beneath the president's bombast, perhaps this is simply payback for the US and its companies,some of whom claim China has stolen intellectual property from them,external. Perhaps Mr Trump is just doing outwardly what some governments have been doing for years. But one thing is certain, Mr Trump's demand for payment has muddied the waters in an already fraught situation. Trump demands US cut of Microsoft TikTok deal How would the US go about banning TikTok?

"Liam Fox was a former trade minister in government Documents on UK-US trade talks, leaked before the 2019 election, were stolen from the personal email account of Tory MP Liam Fox, the BBC understands. Sources revealed on Mondaythat the papers had come from the former minister's account, but not which address the hackers had targeted. The papers were published online and used byLabour in the 2019 campaignto claim the NHS would be put at risk. It is not clear that Mr Fox's use of a personal account was a breach of rules. Cabinet Office advice published in 2013 says MPs are provided with access to government email systems, but ""other forms of electronic communication may be used in the course of conducting government business"". A criminal inquiry into the leaking of the documents is under way, being led by the National Crime Agency. The BBC understands the investigation has been underway since at least the end of last year. Russian hackers stole papers from Liam Fox email Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim The UK government has said Russians almost certainlysought to interfere in the electionthrough the documents. A spokesman for the National Crime Agency confirmed it was leading the investigation, but added he could not comment further. Mr Fox was international trade secretary from July 2016 to July 2019. Last month,he was nominated as the UK government's choice to lead the World Trade Organization, although the new director general has yet to be named. Reuters, whichfirst reported,externalthe story on Monday, said hackers accessed Mr Fox's account multiple times between 12 July and 21 October last year. On Tuesday, a source told the BBC's Gordon Corera the documents had been stolen from Mr Fox's personal account. Reuters has reported thatthe entire contents of Mr Fox's account was taken,external. Responding to Monday's story, a government spokesperson said: ""There is an ongoing criminal investigation into how the documents were acquired, and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this point. ""But as you would expect, the government has very robust systems in place to protect the IT systems of officials and staff."" Last month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had ""reasonable confidence"" that Russian actors had tried to interfere in the December 2019 general election. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election He told the BBC they had sought to ""spread online, illegally obtained, leaked government documents"" around the UK-US trade negotiations for after the country leaves the EU. Mr Raab said the government would ""reserve the right to take the appropriate action"" when the criminal investigation concluded. The UK government was later criticised in a report from the Intelligence and Security Committee -known as the ""Russia report""- for having ""badly underestimated"" the threat the country posed. The mystery of the ""trade leaks"" is slowly being revealed - though still not completely. The 2019 general election now looks like it was the target of what is known a ""hack and leak"" operation, similar - though not on the same scale - as the one Russian military intelligence launched in the 2016 US presidential election. Last month, the government said it believed Russian actors were responsible for spreading the trade document on social media. But there was still the question of how it was first obtained. Now, we know it came from a hack of an email account belonging to Liam Fox. The exact identity of the Russian group behind the attack remains murky. Whether it was the same group which then spread the document is unclear and that group (codenamed Secondary Infektion) is not thought to be the same as the one behind events in the US election, which had a larger impact. Hackers from many countries have targeted politicians in recent years. But coming soon after the Russia report, this will serve as a reminder that groups based in Russia are often the most adept at not just stealing, but also using, the information. Responding to reports of the hack on Mr Fox's email, a spokesperson for the National Cyber Security Centre said on Monday, it works closely with MPs and political parties to offer them ""the best cyber security guidance and support."" ""We have worked closely with political parties for several years on how to protect and defend against cyber attacks - including publishing advice on our website. ""There is an ongoing criminal investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.""

Today's live page was edited by Flora Dury and Sarah Collerton, and written by Sophie Williams, Vicky Bisset, Mary O'Connor, Becky Morton and Holly Honderich. And here are today's top stories from around the world: We'll be pausing our live coverage of Covid-19-related news shortly but here's a quick recap of the main stories from the UK today:  Zimbabwe's Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga has been named as the country's new health minister, a month after his predecessor, Obadiah Moyo, was ousted over a scandal involving coronavirus medical supplies. Moyo was arrested in late June on charges of corruption over a $20m (Â£16m) contract awarded to a Hungary-registered firm, allegedly without going through proper processes. Zimbabwe as seen a relatively low number of coronavirus cases, but doctors say the real number is higher. The country is facing a number of crises and international criticism over its response to anti-corruption protests. Last month, meanwhile, the UN food agency said nearly two-thirds of the population would need food aid by the end of the year because of a poor harvest, rampant inflation and a growing coronavirus problem. Two people wear masks at a market in Zimbabwe last month Across the US, prisons have become Covid-19 hotspots. Overcrowding, cramped quarters and antiquated facilities make social distancing extremely difficult, and curbing an outbreak nearly impossible. And outbreaks in prisons can also lead to infections in neighbouring communities, according to a new study in Health Affairs. In Illinois, researchers from Harvard University's Department of Anthropology and the Center National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris found that more than 4,700 coronavirus cases up until mid-April were associated with 2,129 individuals going through Chicago's Cook County Jail in March. The jail may be linked with more than 15% of all documented cases in the city and state, the researchers said. ""Existing conditions in jails and penitentiaries make infection control particularly difficult, putting inmates at unconscionable and perhaps unconstitutional risk,"" they wrote. The Chicago jail was the largest recorded source of spread of the coronavirus before it was surpassed by an Ohio state prison, according to the researchers.

There are separate systems in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but the principles are broadly the same: You can read more about contact tracinghere. A further six coronavirus deaths have been recorded by NHS England, bringing the total number of people who have died in hospitals in England with the virus to 29,358. Another five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. UK-wide figures cover deaths across all settings, including in care homes and the community, and use a different time frame. US President Donald Trump's campaign sent an email to his supporters, encouraging them to don face masks, as case numbers surge across the country. ""We are all in this together, and while I know there has been some confusion surrounding the usage of face masks, I think it's something we should all try to do when we are not able to be socially distanced from others,"" said the email, sent on Monday and signed by Trump. ""I don't love wearing them either,"" he wrote, but they may help get the US back on track faster. The Republican president wore a mask in public for the first time in July, after resisting wearing one. Donning facial coverings amid the outbreak has become highly politicised in the US. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters are about twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that masks should be worn all the time. A further 89 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died with coronavirus to 46,299. The latest government figures,externalalso show 670 new cases have been recorded. This video can not be played The head of England's contact tracing service has insisted it is ""extremely effective"",after a study warned it may be inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools reopen. Challenged over whether the fact individual local authorities such as Blackburn and Sandwell had set up their own contact tracing system represented a failure of the national service, Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She added that local approaches were ""entirely complementary"" to the national system. ""What NHS Test and Trace is doing
is allowing us to identify areas where the virus is spreading more freely where
we do need to take targeted local action,"" she said. Asked when England's contact tracing app -which was originally expected months ago- would be available, she said it would be launched ""soon"". Police in Washington DC are warning of an increase in vehicle thefts targeting delivery drivers across the city. The citywide notice follows jumps in car thefts across the US since the start of the country's coronavirus outbreak as residents are staying home more and using their cars less. This year, car theft surged by 63% in New York and nearly 17% in Los Angeles from 1 January through mid-May, compared with the same period last year, according to the Associated Press. Police have said the rise is also linked to increased reliance on food delivery by residents staying inside amid the pandemic. Worldwide Google searches for âfood deliveryâ and âlocal foodâ reached all-time highs in April. Nichola MandilBBC News, Juba South Sudan's health ministry says about 78 frontline healthcare workers have tested positive for Covid-19. One male healthcare worker has died, according to a health official. ""It is very unfortunate to mention that we have lost one of the healthcare workers. He used to work at Juba Teaching Hospital, he is one of the people that were affected by the virus and this is the only record we have as a fatality amongst healthcare workers,"" Dr Matthew Tut told journalists in the capital, Juba. Last month, eight health workers resigned because of pressure from their families, who expressed concerns that they might bring the virus home and infect their relatives. Black LGBT people in the US are more
likely to have lost work or had their hours reduced due to the pandemic,according to a study by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC),external. The report also found that black LGBT
people are three times more likely to ask for an extension on their rent than
the general population. Nearly a third of black LGBT people surveyed
had their hours cut due to the pandemic while for non-gay and non-trans black
people the rate was less than one quarter. When it came to job losses, 18% of
black gay and trans people said they had lost their jobs compared to 12% of the
general population. The US has the widest gap in US
unemployment rates between black and white people in five years, according to Reuters
news agency. âEven as black communities, especially
black trans communities, across the country are reckoning with racism and
violence, black LGBT people are also being disproportionately impacted by
Covid-19,â HRC President Alphonso David said. World number two Rafael Nadal was among those who planned to take part The Madrid Open has been cancelled as coronavirus cases continue to rise in Spain. Spain's healthy ministry had advised the organisers aganst proceeding with the tournment, which was due to begin on 12 September, because of the city's ""deteriorating"" coronavirus situation. ""We have no choice but to cancel the tournament due to the complex situation that Covid-19 continues to generate in every regard,"" the organisers said. Spain has recorded more than 302,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and 28,498 deaths, figures released on Tuesday show, with the rate of infection rising rapidly in the country. The Madrid Open is not the only major sporting event to face disruption amid the pandemic, with a range of events - including the Tokyo 2020 Olympics - either postponed or cancelled this year.Find out more here. Reality Check Thankfully, there are fewer people dying than you would usually expect for this time of year. Todayâs statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show in the week to 24 July, there were 161fewer deaths registered in England and Wales,externalthan has been the case on average for the last five years. They call that having negative excess deaths. There have now been negative excess deaths overall for six weeks in a row. The ONS also breaks down the deaths by where they occur - there were negative excess deaths in hospitals and care homes. But in private homes, there have been excess deaths every week since the pandemic began. In the week ending 24 July, there were 727 excess deaths in private homes registered, which is more than 100 a day. What this means is that while we are seeing fewer deaths than you would expect to see in hospitals and care homes, there are considerably more people dying at home than you would expect. Carers in France will each receive a payment of up to â¬1,000 (Â£900; $1,177), President Emmanuel Macron has announced. Speaking during a visit to the city of Toulon on Tuesday, Macron paid tribute to the contribution of carers working with the elderly and disabled during the pandemic. Last month the government approved pay rises for health workers worth â¬8bn (Â£7.2bn; $9bn). France has been among the worst-affected countries in Europe, with more than 30,000 deaths and almost 230,000 infections. The US top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned of a ""really bad situation"" if the country does not bring its daily coronavirus case count down to 10,000 by September. The US is currently recording roughly 50,000 to 60,000 cases each day, Dr Fauci said to NBC News, suggesting the country is ""right in the middle of the first wave"". ""If we don't get them down, then we're going to have a really bad situation in the fall,"" Dr Fauci said. Getting the virus under control will be complicated by the onset of colder temperatures and the typical flu season, he said. There have been more than 4.7 million cases recorded in the US so far, with 155,515 deaths. While some former hot spots have begun to curb infection rates, case numbers continue to surge throughout the country. The international police body Interpol has warned of the ""alarming"" threat posed by cyber criminals since the coronavirus crisis began earlier this year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, criminals have begun to shift their focus from individuals and small businesses to governments and critical infrastructure, Interpol said in a new report. The shift to working from home has also left businesses more vulnerable to attacks, as criminals exploit ""increased security vulnerabilities to steal data, generate profits and cause disruption"". The nature of scams has also evolved to take advantage of the pandemic, with an increase in Covid-19 themed phishing emails, often impersonating health authorities, the report found. Other threats involve the use of deliberately misleading domain names and the use of malicious software (known as malware) and ransomware, which blocks a user's access until a sum of of money is paid. The number of coronavirus cases linked to a pub in Aberdeen has risen to 32 - an increase of five since Monday. The cluster, linked to people who visited the Hawthorn Bar on 26 July, emerged on Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 120 close contacts - who must self-isolate for 14 days - had been identified through the country's contact tracing system. More than 4,000 people have signedan open letter,externalagainst sweeping changes to London's Southbank Centre, which they say will result in ""irrevocable damage"" to its future. Last month the venue, which is the UK's largest arts and culture organisation, began a consultation on plans to make 365 people redundant - more than 60% of its workforce. The letter says the job losses will disproportionately affect lowest-paid staff, which include a high proportion of young people, people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and people with disabilities. According to the letter, staff have been told that when it reopens the centre's programme of contemporary art exhibitions, music and literature events will be allocated just 10% of capacity, with 90% reserved for rental space. The Hayward Gallery, which is based at the centre, reopened earlier this month, but the rest of its venues, including the Royal Festival Hall and the National Poetry Library, remain closed.

"Zhang Yiming The Chinese head of TikTok has defended plans to sell its US operations, describing a deal as the only way to prevent the app from being banned in the US. In a letter to Chinese staff, Zhang Yiming said the critics do not see the ""full context"". The letter comes as US President Donald Trump has threatened to bar the social media company. Chinese state media have said such pressure amounts to ""theft"". On social media, Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance, has also been described as a ""traitor"". In the letter to staff, which was shared by the company, he acknowledged the criticism, but said ""many people misunderstand the current, complex situation"". He reminded staff of the firm's global ambitions and noted a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, including in the US and India. ""As a company, we have to abide by the laws of the markets where we operate,"" he said. ""It feels like the goal was not necessarily a forced sale, but given the current macro situation, a ban or even more."" Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? How would the US go about banning TikTok? The Trump administration has threatened to ban TikTok, saying the data it collects from its users - including an estimated 100 million in the US - is at risk of exploitation by the Chinese government. Beijing and TikTok deny those claims, which the US has made against other Chinese tech firms. But a sale to a US company is seen as a way to alleviate such concerns. On Sunday, Microsoft confirmed it was in discussions with ByteDance over buying TikTok's operations in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - countries that make up four of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. On Tuesday, it was reported that Apple is also interested. This video can not be played What's going on with TikTok? When reports of talks between ByteDance - which has received backing from US investors -  and Microsoft surfaced on Friday, Mr Trump said he opposed the deal. But he later appeared to okay a potential sale, saying the government - which would review any takeover by a US company for national security risks - should receive a ""substantial"" cut of any purchase price. Mr Trump has threatened to ban the app on 15 September if there is no deal. ""The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,"" Mr Trump said. Such a demand is highly unorthodox. Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper, said generally ""the government doesn't have the authority to take a cut of a private deal through"" the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the inter-agency committee that reviews some foreign investments in the US. Charlotte Jee, a reporter at MIT Technology Review, a magazine owned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Mr Trump's comments were ""pretty astonishing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""I hate to say this but it is kind of almost Mafia-like behaviour - threatening a ban which pushes down the price then saying 'oh we should get a cut of that deal afterwards to say thank you for what we've done there'. ""It is extraordinary behaviour as well because last week we had lawmakers in the UStrying to look at whether tech companies are too bigand now we've got Trump trying to make one of them even bigger so it is a really, really bizarre situation to be in."" This video can not be played What is TikTok? By Dearbail Jordan, business correspondent Former FBI director James Comey once said that dealing with Donald Trump gave him ""flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob"". The US president has certainly made TikTok an offer it can't refuse. If the video app doesn't break away from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and sell its US operation to Microsoft, Mr Trump will simply ban it - putting TikTok's access to its 80 million active American users in jeopardy. Mr Trump has already flexed his muscles against other Chinese firms, such as Huawei. But what makes the situation with TikTok unprecedented is the demand for a cut of the sale price. The US Treasury has not explained how this extraordinary demand for a cut of a private transaction would work. Mr Trump reckons the government should get a big slice of the pie because ""we're making it possible"". However, the deal wouldn't be happening in the first place but for his administration's claim that the likes of TikTok are feeding users' data directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Beneath the president's bombast, perhaps this is simply payback for the US and its companies,some of whom claim China has stolen intellectual property from them,external. Perhaps Mr Trump is just doing outwardly what some governments have been doing for years.

"Pizza Express is considering closing 67 of its UK restaurants, which would mean the loss of 1,100 jobs. The chain is the latest High Street outlet to undertake a restructuring of its business after trading was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. The news comes just a day after the government launched its Eat Out to Help Out plan to boost the restaurant trade. Pizza Express would not say which of its 449 UK outlets were possible targets for closure. It currently has 166 restaurants open, all of which are taking part in Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Â£10 off meal deal. All its UK outlets had been closed since lockdown began on 23 March. They began reopening in July when lockdown rules were eased. Pizza Express said in Tuesday's statement that customer demand had been ""encouraging"" at the restaurants which had reopened and that plans for further re-openings were well underway. The company said restructuring the business would put it on a stronger financial footing in the new socially distanced environment. If all 67 outlets are closed, that would mean the loss of 15% of its restaurants, but it said the final outcome was yet to be decided. The big problem for Pizza Express has been its huge debts. More than one billion pounds worth, a sum which was unsustainable. The payments to service its borrowing wiped out its profits over the last two years. A major restructuring has been in the offing for more than a year, long before the pandemic loomed. Debt has been the serial killer for so many companies, from Carillion to Thomas Cook. Unlike a lot of its rivals, 95% of its restaurants are understood to be profitable. The hope is this plan will be enough to strengthen Pizza Express's finances and put it on a more secure footing. But it will probably fall into the hands of its lenders as a result unless a buyer comes forward. Zoe Bowley, UK and Ireland managing director for Pizza Express, said that while the financial restructuring would be a ""positive step forward"", the closures would be ""incredibly sad for our Pizza Express family and we will do everything we can to support our teams at this time"". Many took to social media to comment. Some blamed investors for being greedy, while others said High Street chains needed more help: Allow Twitter content?

Previously, Pizza Express has said the majority of its restaurants are profitable. Pizza Express has heavy debts and last year was known to have started talks to put its debts of more than Â£1bn on more favourable terms. It is expected to announce a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) in the near future, which is an insolvency procedure that allows a company with debt problems to reach agreement with creditors regarding payment of all, or part of its debts. 1965:Pizza Express founder, the late Peter Boizot, brought a pizza oven from Napoli and a chef from Sicily to open his first restaurant in London's Soho. 1992:Mr Boizot grew his empire over the following almost-three decades before selling it for Â£15m to Hugh Osmond and Luke Johnson, the man who was - until recently - chairman of Patisserie Valerie. They floated it on the stock market the next year and ultimately sold out in 1997 when it was worth Â£150m. 2003:It was taken private again in a Â£278m deal by two private equity firms who then floated it two years later - although it lasted less than a year on the public markets before it was returned to private equity hands. 2014:It changed hands again, this time to be acquired for Â£900m by its current owner, Chinese private equity house Hony Capital. 2020:It has more than 600 restaurants globally: 454 in the UK, including five franchises; 19 in Ireland; 24 in Hong Kong; 6 in Singapore; 14 in UAE; 60 in China; and 49 other international sites operated by franchisees. Andy Pellington, group chief finance officer at Pizza Express, said: ""While we have had to make some very difficult decisions, none of which has been taken lightly, we are confident in the actions being taken to reduce the level of debt, create a more focused business and improve the operational performance, all of which puts us in a much stronger position."" Julian Cox, partner at law firm BLM said: ""Pizza Express is yet another household name that has been pushed to the brink by Covid-19. ""Whilst the government has attempted to encourage people through the doors with 'Eat Out to Help Out', the initiative is clearly not going to be enough to protect the sector in the long term.""

"EasyJet is adding more flights to cope with increasing demand from holidaymakers. The airline had expected to operate at just 30% of its normal capacity, but is expanding its schedule to 40% as more people look to escape lockdown. It restarted flying in June and carried over two million passengers in July. ""Returning to the skies again allows us to do what we do best and take our customers on much-needed holidays,"" said boss Johan Lundgren. ""I am really encouraged that we have seen higher than expected levels of demand with load factor of 84% in July with destinations like Faro and Nice remaining popular with customers."" He said bookings for the remainder of the summer ""are performing better than expected"" and as a result, it has expanded its schedule over the July-to-September quarter to fly at around 40% of normal capacity. ""This increased flying will allow us to connect even more customers to family or friends and to take the breaks they have worked hard for,"" he said. EasyJet 'using sickness record to decide job cuts' EasyJet plans to close bases and cut staff What it's like to fly in the 'new normal' He said late summer bookings were performing well, with city destinations such as Amsterdam and Paris also proving popular. The news helped EasyJet's shares climb around 9% in early trading on Tuesday. However, with the price hovering at around 550p, it is still down almost two-thirds on the 1550p price it stood at in February. In the three months to the end of June, EasyJet made just Â£7m after its fleet was grounded from 30 March because of the coronavirus pandemic. But costs for the three months were Â£332.1m, some 79% lower than in the same period in 2019. The company has launched a major restructuring programme which includes ""rightsizing"" the organisation and reducing its workforce by up to 30%. It plans up to 4,500 job cuts and the restructuring includes closing bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports. The airline has launched an employee consultation process on the staff reduction and base closing proposals. The company called on the government to temporarily remove Air Passenger Duty to support the recovery of UK aviation. It said aviation had been one of the ""worst hit"" industries by the pandemic, and government action was needed ""across Europe to retain connectivity and a viable airline infrastructure"". ""Without this we risk long term damage to the recovery."" It said removing Air Passenger Duty would ""significantly quicken"" the reintroduction and growth of the number of flights and routes available in the UK, particularly outside London. EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren has reiterated criticisms of the government's ""blanket approach"" to quarantine arrangements for travellers from countries with high levels of Covid 19. Speaking to journalists following the publication of the company's third quarter trading update, he said there had been no consultation or dialogue with industry - and his company had had no prior warning of the reintroduction of restrictions on travellers coming from Spain. The policy, he said, was ""not based on a risk approach"". Quarantine measures, he argued, should be targeted on a regional basis - for example, allowing travel to and from the Canary Islands and the Balearics to be excluded. There should be more clarity regarding the rules and scientific advice. Referring to problems customers have had obtaining refunds, he suggested that the sheer volume of cancellations caused by the lockdowns had made it impossible to process them quickly. 250,000 flights were cancelled during the period, when last year, the figure had been just 2,500. No company or airline, he insisted, would have been able to set themselves up for the scale of what was required. Mr Lundgren also reiterated his confidence in EasyJet's chief operating officer, Peter Bellew, who has come under fire from the company's pilots over his handling of planned cuts at the business.

"Lebanon is in the throes of its worst crisis for many years The Lebanese government has resigned amid growing public anger following a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August that killed at least 200 people and injured about 5,000 others. The blast came at a difficult time for Lebanon, which is not only trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus but is also mired in an unprecedented economic crisis. The economic situation has pushed tens of thousands people into poverty and triggered large anti-government protests. Announcing the move on Monday, outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab said his government was taking ""a step back... to stand with the people, in order to wage the battle of change with them"". Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the then government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation continued to worsen and last week's deadly explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. People have taken to the streets again, and there have been clashes between protesters and police. The government's plans to investigate the cause of the explosion were not enough for most people, who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption. In his strongly worded speech on Monday, Mr Diab blamed ""a system of corruption... deeply-rooted in all the functions of the state"". ""One of the many examples of corruption exploded in the port of Beirut, and the calamity befell Lebanon,"" he said. ""But corruption cases are widespread in the country's political and administrative landscape; other calamities hiding in many minds and warehouses, and which pose a great threat, are protected by the class that controls the fate of the country."" Even before the coronavirus pandemic at the start of this year, Lebanon seemed to be headed for a crash. Its public debt-to-gross domestic product (what a country owes compared to what it produces) was the third highest in the world; unemployment stood at 25%; and nearly a third of the population was living below the poverty line. The Lebanese pound has lost about 80% of its value over the past 10 months Late last year also saw the unravelling ofwhat analysts said was effectively a state-sponsored pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme,externalrun by the central bank, which was borrowing from commercial banks at above-market interest rates to pay back its debts and maintain the Lebanese pound's fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. At the same time, people were getting increasingly angry and frustrated about the government's failure to provide even basic services. They were having to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water, limited public healthcare, and some of the world's worst internet connections. 'Now there is nothing' - Lebanon pushed to brink How did Lebanon get into such a deep crisis? How Lebanon became the third most indebted nation Many blamed the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. At the start of October 2019, a shortage of foreign currency led to the Lebanese pound losing value against the dollar on a newly emerged black market for the first time in two decades. When importers of wheat and fuel demanded to be paid in dollars, unions called strikes. Then, unprecedented wildfires in the country's western mountains highlighted how underfunded and underequipped the fire service was. Saad Hariri resigned as prime minister in response to the protests In mid-October, the government proposed new taxes on tobacco, petrol, andvoice calls via messaging services such as WhatsAppto drum up more revenue, but a backlash forced it to cancel the plans. However, the debacle unleashed a surge of discontent that had been simmering in Lebanon for years. Tens of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets, leading to the resignation of Western-backed Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his unity government. The protests have cut across sectarian lines and involved people from all sections of society Protests cut across sectarian lines - a rare phenomenon since the country's devastating 1975-1989 civil war ended - and brought the country to a virtual standstill. Newly appointed Prime Minister Hassan Diab subsequently announced that Lebanon would default on its foreign debt for the first time in its history, saying its foreign currency reserves had hit a ""critical and dangerous"" level and that those remaining were needed to pay for vital imports. In the wake of the first Covid-19 deaths and a surge in infections, a lockdown was imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the disease. On the one hand, it forced anti-government protesters off the streets, but on the other, it made the economic crisis much worse and exposed the inadequacies of Lebanon's social welfare system. The prime minister has warned that Lebanon is at ""risk of a major food crisis"" Many business were forced to lay off staff or put them on furlough without pay; the gap between the Lebanese pound's value on the official and black-market exchange rates widened; and banks tightened capital controls. As prices rose further, many families were unable to buy even basic necessities. Growing economic hardship triggered fresh unrest. In Aprila young man was shot dead by soldiers during a violent protest in Tripoliand several banks were set ablaze. The government, meanwhile, finally approved a recovery plan that it hoped would end the economic crisis and win support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package worth $10bn. Banks have been attacked and set on fire by protesters By the time the coronavirus restrictions began to be lifted in May, the prices of some foodstuffs had doubled and Mr Diab warned that Lebanon was at risk of a ""major food crisis"". ""Many Lebanese have already stopped buying meat, fruits and vegetables, and may soon find it difficult to afford even bread,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. Most analysts point to one key factor: political sectarianism, or groups looking after their own interests. Lebanon officially recognises 18 religious communities - four Muslim, 12 Christian, the Druze sect and Judaism. The three main political offices - president, speaker of parliament and prime minister - are divided among the three biggest communities (Maronite Christian; Shia Muslim; and Sunni Muslim, respectively) under an agreement dating back to 1943. Parliament's 128 seats are also divided evenly between Christians and Muslims (including Druze). The seats in parliament are divided between religious communities It is this religious diversity that makes the country an easy target for interference by external powers, as seen with Iran's backing of the Shia Hezbollah movement, widely seen as the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon Since the end of the civil war, political leaders from each sect have maintained their power and influence through a system of patronage networks - protecting the interests of the religious communities they represent, and offering - both legal and illegal - financial incentives. Lebanon ranked 137th out of 180 countries,external(180 being the worst) on Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index. The watchdog says corruption ""permeates all levels of society"" in Lebanon, with political parties, parliament and the police perceived as ""the most corrupt institutions of the country"". It says it is the very system of sectarian power-sharing which is fuelling these patronage networks and hindering Lebanon's system of governance.

"This video can not be played A Linwood High School pupil is congratulated by his mum after receiving his results Thousands of Scottish school pupils have received worse results than they had been expecting after the country's exam body lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total. Exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers based on the pupil's performance over the school year. However, a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. Many pupils have spoken of their disappointment at being given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams, with some claiming they have suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Opposition politicians have warned that there will now be a ""deluge"" of appeals, and accused the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) of treating the professional judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by changing so many grades. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Live coverage: Results day for Scotland's school pupils How grades were worked out in the year with no exams About 138,000 students began receiving their results at 08:00 on Tuesday. The pass rate for National 5 was 81.1%, while the Higher pass rate was 78.9% and the Advanced Higher rate was 84.9%. In 2019, the National 5 pass rate was 78.2%, the Higher pass rate was 74.8% and the Advanced Higher rate was 79.4%. Most pupils take their Nationals when they are in their fourth year of secondary school. They can then stay at school for another two years and work towards Higher qualifications in their fifth year, and Advanced Highers in sixth year. Scottish school pupils traditionally find out their results earlier than those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who will receive their grades for A-levels on 13 August and GCSEs on 20 August. A total of 133,762 individual results were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) from the 511,070 initial estimates of grades that were submitted by teachers. Of these, only 9,198 of the estimates were adjusted up, while 124,564 were adjusted down. Almost all (96%) were adjusted by a single grade. If the results had purely been based on the estimates from teachers, pass rates at grades A-C would have increased by 10.4 percentage points for National 5, by 14 percentage points for Higher and by 13.4 percentage points for Advanced Higher. These estimated results would have led to a higher annual change than had ever been seen before in Scottish exam results if they had not been moderated by the SQA. SQA figures also showed that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, compared to only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. At National 5 level, the pass rate for the poorest pupils was 74% when teachers' estimates would have led to an 84.5% pass rate without moderation. For the least deprived, the 92.3% estimated pass rate fell to 87.1% after the SQA's moderation. The exams body insisted that the most deprived pupils had not suffered compared to previous years - and the Scottish government said the attainment gap has narrowed this year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher. ""But given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" The SQA said the most disadvantaged pupils had achieved better results this year than in 2019, with the number of passes also above the average for the past four years. A spokesman added: ""At Grades A to C, the attainment gap between the most and least disadvantaged young people is also narrower this year for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher than for last year or the average gap for the last four years."" This video can not be played John Swinney says national moderation played an 'important role' in grades Aiden from Falkirk said he had been predicted to get three As and a B in his Highers but was given a B and 3Cs, and has been encouraged by his teachers to appeal. The 17-year-old told the PA news agency that he believes he was penalised for being from a less affluent area. He added: ""I was very proud of the Scottish education system but after this I am really disappointed. ""I don't know how they can give me a B in modern studies because someone in my area got a B in modern studies at a similar level years ago, I just don't think that's fair."" The teenager also said he felt pupils and teachers had been ""left in the dark"" about how results had been awarded by the SQA, and what the appeals process is. Holyrood Secondary pupil Dionne celebrates her results with her dad John Another pupil, Lewis from Bishopbriggs, was given Bs for English and PE despite getting As in the prelim exams, and a D in computing despite getting a C in the prelim. Lewis said: ""I don't understand why the SQA are deciding our results when our teachers have a much better understanding of our work and progress. ""Even then, there is almost never a reason for moving someone down a grade from their predicted grade - it's been a shambles. ""Our teachers have even been emailing us saying they've not got a clue what's been going on."" But Dionne, a pupil at Holyrood Secondary in Glasgow, told BBC Breakfast that her results had been  ""exactly what I was hoping for"". ""It means I'm going to university and I'm just so happy. I can't believe it,"" she said. Her father John said he was ""so proud"" of his daughter, adding: ""She's done so much better than I could have ever done at school. It's been such a time of uncertainty and it's a massive wait over now.""

It will be open from 0800 to 2000 on Tuesday and Wednesday, then 0900 to 1700 on Thursday and Friday. Information and advice is also available on theMy World of Work website,external. James Russell, from SDS, said this year was ""unlike any other"" and that it was understandable that young people and their families would be feeling more anxious than usual. ""Our advice and support is available and our message is if your results aren't what you expected, don't worry - you have lots of options,"" he said. The#NoWrongPath campaign,externalis encouraging people to share their own stories on social media to highlight the different paths available to young people who may be feeling disheartened by their results.

As in the rest of the UK, the grades of pupils who were unable to sit exams have been worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. Teachers were asked to place students within bands for each subject, and rank their pupils in order. These assessments were then checked by the SQA, which said grades had been moderated ""where appropriate"" to ""maintain national standards"". The SQA said it had sought to ""uphold the integrity and credibility"" of the system in its moderation, but that its efforts had been focused on ""ensuring fairness for all learners"". The exams body also said it would look at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment, but denied that a school's previous record could put pupils at either an advantage or a disadvantage. Where a pupil receives a lower grade than the one estimated by their teacher or lecturer, they will be able to usea free appeals process,external. You can read more about how the grades were calculated here The SQA gave many pupils lower grades than had been estimated for them by teachers Scottish Labour has accused the SQA of treating the judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by lowering the grades of so many pupils - which can damage their prospects for university or college. The party's education spokesman, Iain Gray, said: ""Worst of all, the SQA have done this on the basis of each school's past performance, marking the school not the pupil, and baking in the attainment gap. ""They were told that this would be grossly unfair and it is. The SQA will now be deluged with appeals. I hope they are ready to deal with them properly."" The Scottish Conservatives criticised the ""shambolic"" handling of the process by the SQA, and said it ""must honour its commitment and release the methodology it used to assess and award qualifications"". Its education spokesman, Jamie Greene, said: ""Without proper transparency the Scottish public will not have confidence in the process."" And Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens claimed that ""pupils are having their futures disadvantaged and it seems to be for no other reason than they school they go to"". He added: ""How can the SQA say the system is based on teacher judgement when in some schools they have ignored almost every professional judgement that teachers have made?"" The first minister said pupils deserved ""enormous credit"" for the way they had coped after exams were cancelled across the UK as schools closed and the country went into lockdown in March. Ms Sturgeon added: ""At a moment's notice you had to adapt to new forms of learning, your contact with friends and family was restricted, many of you missed out on a proper end to your final year, you didn't get to sit exams. ""Of course, you're now having to think about your future in a time of real economic uncertainty. ""All of that has been really tough and we don't underestimate how tough that has been, and I know that for some of you there will be difficult decisions that lie ahead.""

"The European Commission will carry out a full-scale probe into Google's takeover of Fitbit. The announcement follows,externala preliminary review, and threatens to derail the purchase of the fitness-tracking firm. It comes despite Google's offer last month tonot use Fitbit's health data for ad targeting.,external Google's parent company Alphabet agreed a $2.1bn (Â£1.6bn) takeover of the wearable tech firm last year. However, the deal has yet to be completed. ""The commission is concerned that the proposed transaction would further entrench Google's market position in the online advertising markets by increasing the already vast amount of data that Google could use for personalisation of the ads it serves and displays,"" the regulator said. The watchdog said its investigation should be completed by 9 December. In response, the tech giant said it would cooperate with the process. ""We appreciate the opportunity to work with the European Commission on an approach that addresses consumers' expectations of their wearable devices,"" blogged Google's devices chief Rick Osterloh. California-based Fitbit helped pioneer the fitness tracker market, launching its first device in 2009. It now has about 30 million active users and has sold more than 100 million gadgets to date. However, it currentlyranks behind Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Huawei in terms of global shipments,externalof wearable tech, according to market research firm IDC. It posted a $132m (Â£101m) loss in its last annual results,external, alongside a sales figure that had declined for the fourth year in a row, despite the launch of its Versa 2 smartwatch. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the amount of data wearable devices will generate is set to grow at an exponential rate Analysts suggested part of the attraction for Google was the fact that Fitbit had formed partnerships with several insurers in addition to a government health programme in Singapore. While the European Commission has said its main concern is the ""data advantage"" Google will gain to serve increasingly personalised ads via its search page, it also said its investigation would look into: the effects of the merger on Europe's nascent digital healthcare sector whether Google would have the means and ability to make it more difficult for rival wearables to work with its Android operating system. For its part, Google has explicitly denied its motivation is to control more data. Google has said it wants to build on Fitbit's existing hardware to offer compelling devices to people around the world ""We believe the combination of Google and Fitbit's hardware efforts will increase competition in the sector, making the next generation of devices better and more affordable,"" wrote Mr Osterloh.Â ""This deal is about devices, not data. ""We've been clear from the beginning that we will not use Fitbit health and wellness data for Google ads."" The European Commission acknowledged this commitment, but said it was ""insufficient to clearly dismiss"" its concerns. One digital rights activist welcomed the intervention. ""Google and its parent company Alphabet already have unprecedented control over large parts of the digital world,"" said Wolfie Christl from Cracked Labs, an Austrian research institute. ""They also want to take over digital health and insurance. ""Letting them acquire Fitbit without additional obligations would be a major step into this direction, and thus should not happen."" The European Commission has reason to be wary of Google's promise to restrict its use of Fitbit's data. Smart thermostat-makerNest pledged to keep its user data separate from Google'safter it was acquired in 2014. But Google began asking users to let it merge the logs in 2019. Other tech firms have also reneged on similar assurances. Most notably, Facebook's efforts to integrate WhatsApp with its other messaging services,despite the chat app having declared in 2014,externalthat it would ""remain autonomous and operate independently"". The European Commission has ruled against Google in three previous competition cases, concerning the company's: AdSenseonline advertising service Shopping adsplatform Use of Android topromote its search business In addition, the regulator is considering whether to launch afull-scale investigation into the firm's jobs search tool. Google also faces increased antitrust scrutiny in the US. Its chief executive Sundar Pichai faced several claims of anticompetitive behaviour last week when he was quizzed by Congress, including claims that Google had too much control over the purchase and sale of online ads.

Today's live page was edited by Flora Dury and Sarah Collerton, and written by Sophie Williams, Vicky Bisset, Mary O'Connor, Becky Morton and Holly Honderich. And here are today's top stories from around the world: We'll be pausing our live coverage of Covid-19-related news shortly but here's a quick recap of the main stories from the UK today:  Zimbabwe's Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga has been named as the country's new health minister, a month after his predecessor, Obadiah Moyo, was ousted over a scandal involving coronavirus medical supplies. Moyo was arrested in late June on charges of corruption over a $20m (Â£16m) contract awarded to a Hungary-registered firm, allegedly without going through proper processes. Zimbabwe as seen a relatively low number of coronavirus cases, but doctors say the real number is higher. The country is facing a number of crises and international criticism over its response to anti-corruption protests. Last month, meanwhile, the UN food agency said nearly two-thirds of the population would need food aid by the end of the year because of a poor harvest, rampant inflation and a growing coronavirus problem. Two people wear masks at a market in Zimbabwe last month Across the US, prisons have become Covid-19 hotspots. Overcrowding, cramped quarters and antiquated facilities make social distancing extremely difficult, and curbing an outbreak nearly impossible. And outbreaks in prisons can also lead to infections in neighbouring communities, according to a new study in Health Affairs. In Illinois, researchers from Harvard University's Department of Anthropology and the Center National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris found that more than 4,700 coronavirus cases up until mid-April were associated with 2,129 individuals going through Chicago's Cook County Jail in March. The jail may be linked with more than 15% of all documented cases in the city and state, the researchers said. ""Existing conditions in jails and penitentiaries make infection control particularly difficult, putting inmates at unconscionable and perhaps unconstitutional risk,"" they wrote. The Chicago jail was the largest recorded source of spread of the coronavirus before it was surpassed by an Ohio state prison, according to the researchers. Read more about the spread of Covid in US prisons, and how one California institution went from zero cases in May to one of the worst outbreaks in the country.

There are separate systems in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but the principles are broadly the same: You can read more about contact tracinghere. A further six coronavirus deaths have been recorded by NHS England, bringing the total number of people who have died in hospitals in England with the virus to 29,358. Another five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. UK-wide figures cover deaths across all settings, including in care homes and the community, and use a different time frame. US President Donald Trump's campaign sent an email to his supporters, encouraging them to don face masks, as case numbers surge across the country. ""We are all in this together, and while I know there has been some confusion surrounding the usage of face masks, I think it's something we should all try to do when we are not able to be socially distanced from others,"" said the email, sent on Monday and signed by Trump. ""I don't love wearing them either,"" he wrote, but they may help get the US back on track faster. The Republican president wore a mask in public for the first time in July, after resisting wearing one. Donning facial coverings amid the outbreak has become highly politicised in the US. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters are about twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that masks should be worn all the time. A further 89 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died with coronavirus to 46,299. The latest government figures,externalalso show 670 new cases have been recorded. This video can not be played The head of England's contact tracing service has insisted it is ""extremely effective"",after a study warned it may be inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools reopen. Challenged over whether the fact individual local authorities such as Blackburn and Sandwell had set up their own contact tracing system represented a failure of the national service, Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She added that local approaches were ""entirely complementary"" to the national system. ""What NHS Test and Trace is doing
is allowing us to identify areas where the virus is spreading more freely where
we do need to take targeted local action,"" she said. Asked when England's contact tracing app -which was originally expected months ago- would be available, she said it would be launched ""soon"". Police in Washington DC are warning of an increase in vehicle thefts targeting delivery drivers across the city. The citywide notice follows jumps in car thefts across the US since the start of the country's coronavirus outbreak as residents are staying home more and using their cars less. This year, car theft surged by 63% in New York and nearly 17% in Los Angeles from 1 January through mid-May, compared with the same period last year, according to the Associated Press. Police have said the rise is also linked to increased reliance on food delivery by residents staying inside amid the pandemic. Worldwide Google searches for âfood deliveryâ and âlocal foodâ reached all-time highs in April. Nichola MandilBBC News, Juba South Sudan's health ministry says about 78 frontline healthcare workers have tested positive for Covid-19. One male healthcare worker has died, according to a health official. ""It is very unfortunate to mention that we have lost one of the healthcare workers. He used to work at Juba Teaching Hospital, he is one of the people that were affected by the virus and this is the only record we have as a fatality amongst healthcare workers,"" Dr Matthew Tut told journalists in the capital, Juba. Last month, eight health workers resigned because of pressure from their families, who expressed concerns that they might bring the virus home and infect their relatives. Black LGBT people in the US are more
likely to have lost work or had their hours reduced due to the pandemic,according to a study by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC),external. The report also found that black LGBT
people are three times more likely to ask for an extension on their rent than
the general population. Nearly a third of black LGBT people surveyed
had their hours cut due to the pandemic while for non-gay and non-trans black
people the rate was less than one quarter. When it came to job losses, 18% of
black gay and trans people said they had lost their jobs compared to 12% of the
general population. The US has the widest gap in US
unemployment rates between black and white people in five years, according to Reuters
news agency. âEven as black communities, especially
black trans communities, across the country are reckoning with racism and
violence, black LGBT people are also being disproportionately impacted by
Covid-19,â HRC President Alphonso David said. World number two Rafael Nadal was among those who planned to take part The Madrid Open has been cancelled as coronavirus cases continue to rise in Spain. Spain's healthy ministry had advised the organisers aganst proceeding with the tournment, which was due to begin on 12 September, because of the city's ""deteriorating"" coronavirus situation. ""We have no choice but to cancel the tournament due to the complex situation that Covid-19 continues to generate in every regard,"" the organisers said. Spain has recorded more than 302,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and 28,498 deaths, figures released on Tuesday show, with the rate of infection rising rapidly in the country. The Madrid Open is not the only major sporting event to face disruption amid the pandemic, with a range of events - including the Tokyo 2020 Olympics - either postponed or cancelled this year.Find out more here. Reality Check Thankfully, there are fewer people dying than you would usually expect for this time of year. Todayâs statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show in the week to 24 July, there were 161fewer deaths registered in England and Wales,externalthan has been the case on average for the last five years. They call that having negative excess deaths. There have now been negative excess deaths overall for six weeks in a row. The ONS also breaks down the deaths by where they occur - there were negative excess deaths in hospitals and care homes. But in private homes, there have been excess deaths every week since the pandemic began. In the week ending 24 July, there were 727 excess deaths in private homes registered, which is more than 100 a day. What this means is that while we are seeing fewer deaths than you would expect to see in hospitals and care homes, there are considerably more people dying at home than you would expect. Carers in France will each receive a payment of up to â¬1,000 (Â£900; $1,177), President Emmanuel Macron has announced. Speaking during a visit to the city of Toulon on Tuesday, Macron paid tribute to the contribution of carers working with the elderly and disabled during the pandemic. Last month the government approved pay rises for health workers worth â¬8bn (Â£7.2bn; $9bn). France has been among the worst-affected countries in Europe, with more than 30,000 deaths and almost 230,000 infections. The US top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned of a ""really bad situation"" if the country does not bring its daily coronavirus case count down to 10,000 by September. The US is currently recording roughly 50,000 to 60,000 cases each day, Dr Fauci said to NBC News, suggesting the country is ""right in the middle of the first wave"". ""If we don't get them down, then we're going to have a really bad situation in the fall,"" Dr Fauci said. Getting the virus under control will be complicated by the onset of colder temperatures and the typical flu season, he said. There have been more than 4.7 million cases recorded in the US so far, with 155,515 deaths. While some former hot spots have begun to curb infection rates, case numbers continue to surge throughout the country. The international police body Interpol has warned of the ""alarming"" threat posed by cyber criminals since the coronavirus crisis began earlier this year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, criminals have begun to shift their focus from individuals and small businesses to governments and critical infrastructure, Interpol said in a new report. The shift to working from home has also left businesses more vulnerable to attacks, as criminals exploit ""increased security vulnerabilities to steal data, generate profits and cause disruption"". The nature of scams has also evolved to take advantage of the pandemic, with an increase in Covid-19 themed phishing emails, often impersonating health authorities, the report found. Other threats involve the use of deliberately misleading domain names and the use of malicious software (known as malware) and ransomware, which blocks a user's access until a sum of of money is paid. The number of coronavirus cases linked to a pub in Aberdeen has risen to 32 - an increase of five since Monday. The cluster, linked to people who visited the Hawthorn Bar on 26 July, emerged on Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 120 close contacts - who must self-isolate for 14 days - had been identified through the country's contact tracing system. More than 4,000 people have signedan open letter,externalagainst sweeping changes to London's Southbank Centre, which they say will result in ""irrevocable damage"" to its future. Last month the venue, which is the UK's largest arts and culture organisation, began a consultation on plans to make 365 people redundant - more than 60% of its workforce. The letter says the job losses will disproportionately affect lowest-paid staff, which include a high proportion of young people, people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and people with disabilities. According to the letter, staff have been told that when it reopens the centre's programme of contemporary art exhibitions, music and literature events will be allocated just 10% of capacity, with 90% reserved for rental space. The Hayward Gallery, which is based at the centre, reopened earlier this month, but the rest of its venues, including the Royal Festival Hall and the National Poetry Library, remain closed.

"EasyJet is adding more flights to cope with increasing demand from holidaymakers. The airline had expected to operate at just 30% of its normal capacity, but is expanding its schedule to 40% as more people look to escape lockdown. It restarted flying in June and carried over two million passengers in July. ""Returning to the skies again allows us to do what we do best and take our customers on much-needed holidays,"" said boss Johan Lundgren. ""I am really encouraged that we have seen higher than expected levels of demand with load factor of 84% in July with destinations like Faro and Nice remaining popular with customers."" He said bookings for the remainder of the summer ""are performing better than expected"" and as a result, it has expanded its schedule over the July-to-September quarter to fly at around 40% of normal capacity. ""This increased flying will allow us to connect even more customers to family or friends and to take the breaks they have worked hard for,"" he said. EasyJet 'using sickness record to decide job cuts' EasyJet plans to close bases and cut staff What it's like to fly in the 'new normal' He said late summer bookings were performing well, with city destinations such as Amsterdam and Paris also proving popular. The news helped EasyJet's shares climb around 9% in early trading on Tuesday. However, with the price hovering at around 550p, it is still down almost two-thirds on the 1550p price it stood at in February. In the three months to the end of June, EasyJet made just Â£7m after its fleet was grounded from 30 March because of the coronavirus pandemic. But costs for the three months were Â£332.1m, some 79% lower than in the same period in 2019. The company has launched a major restructuring programme which includes ""rightsizing"" the organisation and reducing its workforce by up to 30%. It plans up to 4,500 job cuts and the restructuring includes closing bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports. The airline has launched an employee consultation process on the staff reduction and base closing proposals. The company called on the government to temporarily remove Air Passenger Duty to support the recovery of UK aviation. It said aviation had been one of the ""worst hit"" industries by the pandemic, and government action was needed ""across Europe to retain connectivity and a viable airline infrastructure"". ""Without this we risk long term damage to the recovery."" It said removing Air Passenger Duty would ""significantly quicken"" the reintroduction and growth of the number of flights and routes available in the UK, particularly outside London. EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren has reiterated criticisms of the government's ""blanket approach"" to quarantine arrangements for travellers from countries with high levels of Covid 19. Speaking to journalists following the publication of the company's third quarter trading update, he said there had been no consultation or dialogue with industry - and his company had had no prior warning of the reintroduction of restrictions on travellers coming from Spain. The policy, he said, was ""not based on a risk approach"". Quarantine measures, he argued, should be targeted on a regional basis - for example, allowing travel to and from the Canary Islands and the Balearics to be excluded. There should be more clarity regarding the rules and scientific advice. Referring to problems customers have had obtaining refunds, he suggested that the sheer volume of cancellations caused by the lockdowns had made it impossible to process them quickly. 250,000 flights were cancelled during the period, when last year, the figure had been just 2,500. No company or airline, he insisted, would have been able to set themselves up for the scale of what was required. Mr Lundgren also reiterated his confidence in EasyJet's chief operating officer, Peter Bellew, who has come under fire from the company's pilots over his handling of planned cuts at the business.

"German carmaker Audi has apologised for an advert showing a little girl eating a banana in front of a high-performance car, after it drew a torrent of criticism on social media. ""We hear you and let's get this straight: We care for children,"" Audi tweeted in its apology. ""We sincerely apologize for this insensitive image and ensure that it will not be used in future."" Critics said the child's pose was ""provocative"" and life-threatening. Some pointed out that the driver would not be able to see the child in that pose, leaning on the grille. Others said the image was sexually suggestive, as bananas and sports cars have often been seen as symbols of male lust. Audi's slogan in English above the image reads: ""Lets your heart beat faster - in every aspect."" The firm says it is now investigating how the ad came to be published. In May the German car giant Volkswagen, owner of Audi, became embroiled in a similar social media row. Its ad showed a dark-skinned man being manoeuvred around by a pair of white women's hands, before being flicked away from a yellow VW Golf to a jaunty soundtrack. VW pulls Instagram ads after racism row Thefull ad for the Audi RS 4,externalon the firm's website shows it being marketed as a family car - and that was apparently the context for the controversial Twitter ad featuring the little girl eating a banana. Jane Bradford tweeted under the Audi apology: ""So, let your heart beat faster in every aspect? Picture of - child with banana in mouth and flash car- so wrong in EVERY aspect"". Shiri@home tweeted: ""Little girl with phallic symbol in her hand. Clear, super..."" And DjBeeTee tweeted: ""Let's add it up: Red=eroticism, sports car=substitute for potency, animal print mini-skirt=sex appeal, banana=phallic symbol. But sure this is all just accidental..."" However, Mark Kreuzer, an engineer and blogger, tweeted: ""Hmm, well for me the message is: Audi RS4 = family car. Just as your own daughter makes your heart beat faster, so does the RS4.

"Current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools in the UK reopen, scientists have warned. Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children, they say. Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important - but more work was needed to keep the virus in check. The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was ""already delivering"" and on the right track for future. Baroness Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was ""well within the bounds"" of what the researchers ""are saying is necessary"". The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems. Asked about the estimate that only 50% of contacts are being traced in England, Simon Clarke, minister for regional growth, told the BBC government figures were higher. He said NHS test and trace is ""maturing all the time"" and getting children back to school in the autumn is a ""top priority"" that the government would not ""be willing to trade"". ""You're building an entirely new infrastructure which there's no precedent for,"" he said. ""But we're confident it is working, we're confident that it will continue to improve, and we're confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn."" Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid-19, said the virus is ""capable of surging back really quickly"" and stressed the importance of being able to trace, test and isolate people. ""If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they're dealt with quickly and life can go on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He later said he thinks Britain ""will do really well"" because there is ""really good attention to where the virus is locally"" and a lot of ""public engagement in getting on top of it"". A government spokesman said local authorities will ""be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases"". LOCKDOWN LIMIT:Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities. The study assumes childrenare less likely to catch- and therefore spread - coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home. As first reported in June, the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective test-and-trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown. The study,now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health,external, shows a second wave could be prevented if: both 75% of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68% of their contacts traced or both 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts traced However, the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short. They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested, they say this also appears too low. ""It is not achieving the levels we have modelled. It doesn't look good enough to me,"" said Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, added: ""With UK schools reopening fully in September, prevention of a second wave will require a major scale-up of testing to test 75% of symptomatic infections - combined with tracing of 68% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases."" How test-and-trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine Postcode search: See case numbers in your area GCSE students allowed to drop poetry in 2021 exams Schools will be ready for September - minister Schools have been shut around the world as countries used lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19. It is estimated1.6 billion children,externalhave been kept out of the classroom. In the UK, schools closed on 20 March, except to children of key workers or vulnerable children. On 1 June, they began a limited reopening for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Schools are due to restart for all children in Scotland on 11 August and across the UK in early September. But every step taken to open up society makes it easier for the coronavirus to spread. Cases arealready starting to riseand the idea of closing pubs in order to open schoolshas already been floated. The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has said ""we are near the limit"" of what we can do without causing a resurgence. The individual nations of the UK have their own contact tracing systems. The government said NHS test and trace in England has reached 80% of those testing positive and traced over 75% of their contacts. The Welsh government said its advisory group recommended that schools open in September with all pupils present on site, and ""we should be aiming to trace an estimated 80% of contacts, at least 35% of which are to be traced within 24 hours"". Since 21 June, 90% of close contacts were reached by the service,according to Welsh government figures,external. A Scottish government spokesperson said guidance set out ""a number of specific risk-mitigation measures that will need to be introduced"" including an ""enhanced surveillance programme"". In Northern Ireland,the latest figures for the week to 29 July,externalshowed 98% of contacts were successfully reached by the country's contact tracing service.

"Residents of Manila can only step out for essentials Tens of millions of people in the Philippines are back in lockdown, after doctors warned a surge in new coronavirus cases could push the healthcare system to collapse. Stay-at-home orders are now in place in Manila and four surrounding provinces on the island of Luzon for two weeks. The country only just emerged from one of the strictest lockdowns in June. But hospitals have been struggling to cope with a five-fold rise in confirmed infections, now surging past 100,000. The lockdown means a return to stay-at-home orders except for going out to buy essential goods or exercising outdoors. Public transport has also been suspended and domestic flights are grounded, while restaurants are restricted to takeaways. The new lockdown came after 80 medical associations on Saturday called on President Rodrigo Duterte to toughen restrictions in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. On Sunday the Philippines announced a record 5,032 new infections. In some areas hospitals are reported to have been forced to turn away soaring numbers of patients. Doctors hope the reinstated restrictions will now give medical workers more time to deal with the spike in cases. With only 24 hours notice of the shutdown, which took effect on Tuesday, many people have found themselves stranded in the capital without any transport to return to their hometowns. ""We've run out of money. We can't leave the airport because we don't have any relatives here,"" Ruel Damaso, a 36-year-old construction worker, told AFP. He was trying to return to the southern city of Zamboanga. In other parts of Manila people were seen stockpiling food the day before restrictions began as they prepared to stay indoors for a second time. The earlier shutdown from mid-March to May was one of the world's longest stay-at-home orders. There have been 2,104 deaths in the Philippines from Covid-19, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

"Current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools in the UK reopen, scientists have warned. Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children, they say. Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important - but more work was needed to keep the virus in check. The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was ""already delivering"" and on the right track for future. Baroness Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was ""well within the bounds"" of what the researchers ""are saying is necessary"". The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems. Asked about the estimate that only 50% of contacts are being traced in England, Simon Clarke, minister for regional growth, told the BBC government figures were higher. He said NHS test and trace is ""maturing all the time"" and getting children back to school in the autumn is a ""top priority"" that the government would not ""be willing to trade"". ""You're building an entirely new infrastructure which there's no precedent for,"" he said. ""But we're confident it is working, we're confident that it will continue to improve, and we're confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn."" Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid-19, said the virus is ""capable of surging back really quickly"" and stressed the importance of being able to trace, test and isolate people. ""If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they're dealt with quickly and life can go on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He later said he thinks Britain ""will do really well"" because there is ""really good attention to where the virus is locally"" and a lot of ""public engagement in getting on top of it"". A government spokesman said local authorities will ""be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases"". LOCKDOWN LIMIT:Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities. The study assumes childrenare less likely to catch- and therefore spread - coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home. As first reported in June, the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective test-and-trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown. The study,now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health,external, shows a second wave could be prevented if: both 75% of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68% of their contacts traced or both 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts traced However, the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short. They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested, they say this also appears too low. ""It is not achieving the levels we have modelled. It doesn't look good enough to me,"" said Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, added: ""With UK schools reopening fully in September, prevention of a second wave will require a major scale-up of testing to test 75% of symptomatic infections - combined with tracing of 68% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases."" How test-and-trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine Postcode search: See case numbers in your area GCSE students allowed to drop poetry in 2021 exams Schools will be ready for September - minister Schools have been shut around the world as countries used lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19.

"More than 1,500 police are patrolling the streets of Melbourne to enforce the lockdown Authorities in the Australian city of Melbourne have warned of a ""dangerous"" rise in people resisting lockdown measures, sometimes violently. Police said this trend included so-called ""sovereign citizens"" - who espouse an anti-government ideology - confronting officers. In one case a woman repeatedly smashed a policewoman's head into the ground. Authorities have increased fines for repeated rule breaches as Melbourne endures a deadly virus second wave. More than half of Australia's 18,300 cases have been recorded in the past month in Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital. There have been 226 deaths nationally. Melbourne has recently mandated wearing masks and tightened a stay-at-home order to reduce transmissions. But authorities said many people were breaking rules, including some who claimed to be ""above the law"". Victoria declares state of disaster to curb virus What is the 'sovereign citizen' movement? Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said Victoria Police had seen an ""emergence"" of ""concerning groups of people who classify themselves as 'sovereign citizens'"". The sovereign citizen movement - which has roots in the US - is typically used by those who don't believe in their government's legitimacy, often arguing their rights are being suppressed by public orders. Mr Patton said the attack on the policewoman ""highlights the type of challenges that we're experiencing"", adding that people were ""baiting"" police at checkpoints and refusing to disclose basic information. ""On at least four occasions in the last week we've had to smash the windows of cars and pull people out to provide details,"" he said. ""Most Victorians are doing the right thing, no question,"" said Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews. Mr Andrews said rule breakers would face increased fines ""But we have this continual minority of people who are knowingly - not by mistake, but are knowingly - doing the wrong thing and putting people's lives at risk by doing so."" Random checks by police on 3,000 infected people had found more than 800 were not home isolating, as they were supposed to be. On Tuesday, the state government increased fines for repeated lockdown breaches from A$1,652 (Â£900; $1,200) to A$5,000. Under the current ""stage four"" lockdown, Melburnians can leave home only to shop, exercise, give essential medical care or do frontline work. Residents must shop and exercise within 5km (3 miles) of their home, for no longer than one hour at a time. Only one person per household is allowed to go grocery shopping An additional curfew for between 20:00 and 05:00 was implemented on Sunday. The only exemptions are for work, medical care or care-giving, and workers must have a permit. Authorities said recent breaches included ""Airbnb parties"" and people breaking the curfew to get alcohol and fast food. Mr Patton said the policewoman had been attacked in a shopping centre after stopping a woman for not wearing a mask. ""After a confrontation and being assaulted by that woman, those police officers went to ground and there was a scuffle,"" he said. ""And during that scuffle, this 38-year-old woman smashed the head of the policewoman several times into a concrete area on the ground."" Since masks became compulsory about two weeks ago, there have been other prominent incidents involving ""anti-maskers"" and others questioning the legality of lockdown. Widely shared videos include two women loudly defending not wearing a mask inside a hardware shop, and one woman deceiving police at a state border checkpoint. What exactly is a 'Karen'?

"BP has halved its shareholder dividend and posted a $6.7bn quarterly loss after the coronavirus pandemic hit global demand for oil. The dividend news is another blow for pension funds and private investors who have seen a string of firms cut or halt payouts. The loss was largely due to BP writing down the value of its assetsafter it cut its oil price forecasts. BP said the outlook for oil prices and demand was ""challenging and uncertain"". It also warned that the pandemic could weigh on the global economy for a ""sustained period"". In the short-term, BP said it expected demand for oil could be up to nine million barrels per day lower compared to last year. It has already announced it will cut 10,000 jobs, with as many as 2,000 set to be lost in the UK. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? Shell cuts dividend for first time since WW2 Oil prices have plunged after the coronavirus virtually shut down major economies. In April, the price turned negative for the first time in history, meaning producers had to pay buyers to take oil off their hands over fear storage capacity could run out. BP's loss for the three months to June compares to a $2.8bn profit in the same period last year. The oil giant said its dividend would halve to 5.25 cents a share, compared to 10.5 cents in the first quarter. It follows a similar, earlier move by rival Royal Dutch Shell which cut its first quarter dividend in April - the first reduction to its shareholder payment since the Second World War. The dividend blows for investors and retirement savers just keep on coming. After Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II and Britain's banks suspended their payouts, BP has now halved its dividend - its first cut for more than a decade. That is a particularly hard blow for UK pension funds and the army of pensioner investors who rely on the payouts. BP traditionally generates the largest dividend payment among the big blue chip FTSE 100 giants. Dividend watchers now reckon the total amount of payouts by British firms will fall by two-fifths in 2020. Link Group's Dividend Monitor shows that dividends fell by a 57% in the second quarter of the year as 176 companies cancelled payouts and 30 more have cut them. That's not disastrous for investors, but it will be painful. Despite BP's loss and a lower dividend, the company's share price rose by 6.26% to 298.6p as it announced a new strategy. BP said it wanted to ""pivot"" from being a traditional oil company to an ""integrated energy company"" and said it expects to achieve ""net zero"" carbon emissions for the company by 2050. Over the next decade, BP forecasts that oil and gas production will fall by at least one million barrels of oil a day, or 40% compared to 2019. It plans to invest in renewables, bioenergy and as well as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology. Bernard Looney, who took over as BP chief executive in February, said: ""This coming decade is critical for the world in the fight against climate change, and to drive the necessary change in global energy systems will require action from everyone.""

"Donald Trump says the government should get a cut from the sale of TikTok's US unit if an American firm buys it. The US president said he made a demand for a ""substantial portion"" of the purchase price in a phone call at the weekend with Microsoft's boss. He also warned he will ban the app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, on 15 September if there is no deal. ByteDance is under pressure to sell its US business after Mr Trump threatened a crackdown on Chinese tech companies. Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? How would the US go about banning TikTok? The Trump administration has accused TikTok and others of providing data to the Chinese government, which Beijing and TikTok deny. ""The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played What is TikTok? ""It would come from the sale, which nobody else would be thinking about but me, but that's the way I think, and I think it's very fair,"" he added. The request for payment to the US Treasury further complicated negotiations as legal experts highlighted that such a demand to secure regulatory approval for a takeover deal would be highly unorthodox. Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper, said generally ""the government doesn't have the authority to take a cut of a private deal through"" the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the inter-agency committee that reviews some foreign investments in the US. The state-run China Daily newspaper said on Tuesday that Beijing would not accept the ""theft"" of a Chinese technology company. It also warned in an editorial that China had ""plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab"". Charlotte Jee, a reporter at MIT Technology Review, a magazine owned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Mr Trump's comments were ""pretty astonishing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""I hate to say this but it is kind of almost Mafia-like behaviour - threatening a ban which pushes down the price then saying 'oh we should get a cut of that deal afterwards to say thank you for what we've done there'. ""It is extraordinary behaviour as well because last week we had lawmakers in the UStrying to look at whether tech companies are too bigand now we've got Trump trying to make one of them even bigger so it is a really, really bizarre situation to be in."" Talks over a potential deal looked to have been derailed on Friday when Mr Trump said he opposed Microsoft buying TikTok's US business. While Mr Trump now giving his approval to a possible takeover is a major shift in the White House's position, the tight deadline for talks is another major hurdle for any potential deal. By Dearbail Jordan, business correspondent Former FBI director James Comey once said that dealing with Donald Trump gave him ""flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob"". The US president has certainly made TikTok an offer it can't refuse. If the video app doesn't break away from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and sell its US operation to Microsoft, Mr Trump will simply ban it - putting TikTok's access to its 80 million active American users in jeopardy. Mr Trump has already flexed his muscles against other Chinese firms, such as Huawei. But what makes the situation with TikTok unprecedented is the demand for a cut of the sale price. The US Treasury has not explained how this extraordinary demand for a cut of a private transaction would work. Mr Trump reckons the government should get a big slice of the pie because ""we're making it possible"". However, the deal wouldn't be happening in the first place but for his administration's claim that the likes of TikTok are feeding users' data directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Beneath the president's bombast, perhaps this is simply payback for the US and its companies,some of whom claim China has stolen intellectual property from them,external. Perhaps Mr Trump is just doing outwardly what some governments have been doing for years. But one thing is certain, Mr Trump's demand for payment has muddied the waters in an already fraught situation. TikTok's US operations ""will close down on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal so the Treasuryâ¦ of the United States gets a lot of money,"" he said. As well as TikTok's US business, Microsoft is also in talks to buy its operations in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - countries that make up four of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. The UK is also a member of the alliance and there has been speculation that TikTok could base its global headquarters in London, joining tech giants such as Google which has a major presence in the capital. ByteDance said: ""ByteDance is committed to being a global company. In light of the current situation, ByteDance has been evaluating the possibility of establishing TikTok's headquarters outside of the US, to better serve our global users."" This video can not be played Will TikTok be banned? White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested that Microsoft could shed its holdings in China if it buys TikTok's US business. ""So the question is, is Microsoft going to be compromised?"" Mr Navarro said in an interview with CNN.  ""Maybe Microsoft could divest its Chinese holdings?"" Microsoft confirmed on Sunday in a blog postthat it would continue discussions on a potential deal with TikTok after a call between its chief executive Satya Nadella and Mr Trump. The technology giant declined to comment further on the conversation between Mr Trump and Mr Nadella beyond the blog. At the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Trump would take action ""in the coming days"" against Chinese-owned software companies that he believed posed a national security risk. Mr Pompeo told Fox News that TikTok was among those ""feeding data directly to the Chinese Communist Party"". However, he did not offer any evidence to back up his claim.

"German carmaker Audi has apologised for an advert showing a little girl eating a banana in front of a high-performance car, after it drew a torrent of criticism on social media. ""We hear you and let's get this straight: We care for children,"" Audi tweeted in its apology. ""We sincerely apologize for this insensitive image and ensure that it will not be used in future."" Critics said the child's pose was ""provocative"" and life-threatening. Some pointed out that the driver would not be able to see the child in that pose, leaning on the grille. Others said the image was sexually suggestive, as bananas and sports cars have often been seen as symbols of male lust. Audi's slogan in English above the image reads: ""Lets your heart beat faster - in every aspect."" The firm says it is now investigating how the ad came to be published. In May the German car giant Volkswagen, owner of Audi, became embroiled in a similar social media row. Its ad showed a dark-skinned man being manoeuvred around by a pair of white women's hands, before being flicked away from a yellow VW Golf to a jaunty soundtrack. VW pulls Instagram ads after racism row Thefull ad for the Audi RS 4,externalon the firm's website shows it being marketed as a family car - and that was apparently the context for the controversial Twitter ad featuring the little girl eating a banana. Jane Bradford tweeted under the Audi apology: ""So, let your heart beat faster in every aspect? Picture of - child with banana in mouth and flash car- so wrong in EVERY aspect"". Shiri@home tweeted: ""Little girl with phallic symbol in her hand. Clear, super..."" And DjBeeTee tweeted: ""Let's add it up: Red=eroticism, sports car=substitute for potency, animal print mini-skirt=sex appeal, banana=phallic symbol. But sure this is all just accidental..."" However, Mark Kreuzer, an engineer and blogger, tweeted: ""Hmm, well for me the message is: Audi RS4 = family car. Just as your own daughter makes your heart beat faster, so does the RS4. And both are of course cool."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played ""They've stolen a Land Rover, diesel, roof slates"" Rural crime cost Welsh businesses Â£2.6m last year as organised gangs targeted machinery and livestock, an insurance company has said. NFU Mutual's annual rural crime report said the cost rose 11.1% in 2019, compared to 2018 - higher than the average UK rise of 8.8%. Across the UK, rural crime cost Â£54m - an increase of nearly 9%. There are fears that incidents could escalate when the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is felt. The report said high-value tractors, quad bikes and large numbers of livestock had been targeted. Farmers' helpline to be expanded across Wales Welsh farmers 'lag behind on diversification' Machinery and tractors have been targeted by thieves Expensive tractors are being exported and sold in rich countries, the insurer said, while older models are being shipped to poorer countries. While crime generally decreased during the initial lockdown period earlier this year, NFU Mutual said there were fears rural crime could now escalate. Manager for Wales, Owen Suckley, said: ""Rural crime is like a wave as organised criminality spreads through our farms and villages, affecting everyone in the countryside. ""We continue to work hard to stem the tide and are warning rural communities and helping with prevention advice, as there are concerns for the months ahead as the economic impact of coronavirus bites. ""As well as the financial cost, there's a serious effect on the mental well-being of people living in rural and often isolated areas. ""There are fears that the impact will be felt harder this year as farmers have been working flat-out to feed the nation and many rural communities have been put under additional pressure by the challenges brought by Covid-19."" Livestock have been taken and there are fears the problem could grow worse in the coming months Chris Alford, who farms in the Brecon area, has previously had vehicles and machinery stolen, and more recently, a solar-powered fence charger. He said: ""I'd only had the fence energiser for two weeks before it was taken. A brand new piece of solar-powered kit that obviously looked expensive. ""People can so easily search the value of things on their phones now that even specialist items like this can be identified as a payday by a passer-by. ""The energiser was worth a couple of hundred pounds, which might not seem like much, but the effect of rural crime goes so much deeper than the monetary costs."" He added: ""Then there's the emotional impact. Once you've stopped feeling angry, it's actually gut-wrenching. You can write-off the day you find you've fallen victim to crime. In the past, when I've had larger things like vehicles stolen, it's affected me for weeks. ""It plays on your mind and makes it hard to concentrate on anything else. ""The thought of a stranger being on your property, and stealing from you, can make you feel paranoid, with a voice in your head telling you that they'll be back to steal again. You find yourself making business decisions based on what will make you least attractive to repeat theft.""

"BP has halved its shareholder dividend and posted a $6.7bn quarterly loss after the coronavirus pandemic hit global demand for oil. The dividend news is another blow for pension funds and private investors who have seen a string of firms cut or halt payouts. The loss was largely due to BP writing down the value of its assetsafter it cut its oil price forecasts. BP said the outlook for oil prices and demand was ""challenging and uncertain"". It also warned that the pandemic could weigh on the global economy for a ""sustained period"". In the short-term, BP said it expected demand for oil could be up to nine million barrels per day lower compared to last year. It has already announced it will cut 10,000 jobs, with as many as 2,000 set to be lost in the UK. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? Shell cuts dividend for first time since WW2 Oil prices have plunged after the coronavirus virtually shut down major economies. In April, the price turned negative for the first time in history, meaning producers had to pay buyers to take oil off their hands over fear storage capacity could run out. BP's loss for the three months to June compares to a $2.8bn profit in the same period last year. The oil giant said its dividend would halve to 5.25 cents a share, compared to 10.5 cents in the first quarter. It follows a similar, earlier move by rival Royal Dutch Shell which cut its first quarter dividend in April - the first reduction to its shareholder payment since the Second World War. The dividend blows for investors and retirement savers just keep on coming. After Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II and Britain's banks suspended their payouts, BP has now halved its dividend - its first cut for more than a decade. That is a particularly hard blow for UK pension funds and the army of pensioner investors who rely on the payouts. BP traditionally generates the largest dividend payment among the big blue chip FTSE 100 giants. Dividend watchers now reckon the total amount of payouts by British firms will fall by two-fifths in 2020. Link Group's Dividend Monitor shows that dividends fell by a 57% in the second quarter of the year as 176 companies cancelled payouts and 30 more have cut them. That's not disastrous for investors, but it will be painful. Despite BP's loss and a lower dividend, the company's share price rose by 6.26% to 298.6p as it announced a new strategy. BP said it wanted to ""pivot"" from being a traditional oil company to an ""integrated energy company"" and said it expects to achieve ""net zero"" carbon emissions for the company by 2050. Over the next decade, BP forecasts that oil and gas production will fall by at least one million barrels of oil a day, or 40% compared to 2019. It plans to invest in renewables, bioenergy and as well as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology. Bernard Looney, who took over as BP chief executive in February, said: ""This coming decade is critical for the world in the fight against climate change, and to drive the necessary change in global energy systems will require action from everyone.""

"Pizza Express is considering closing 67 of its UK restaurants, which would mean the loss of 1,100 jobs. The chain is the latest High Street outlet to undertake a restructuring of its business after trading was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. The news comes just a day after the government launched its Eat Out to Help Out plan to boost the restaurant trade. Pizza Express would not say which of its 449 UK outlets were possible targets for closure. It currently has 166 restaurants open, all of which are taking part in Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Â£10 off meal deal. All its UK outlets had been closed since lockdown began on 23 March. They began reopening in July when lockdown rules were eased. Pizza Express said in Tuesday's statement that customer demand had been ""encouraging"" at the restaurants which had reopened and that plans for further re-openings were well underway. The company said restructuring the business would put it on a stronger financial footing in the new socially distanced environment. If all 67 outlets are closed, that would mean the loss of 15% of its restaurants, but it said the final outcome was yet to be decided. The big problem for Pizza Express has been its huge debts. More than one billion pounds worth, a sum which was unsustainable. The payments to service its borrowing wiped out its profits over the last two years. A major restructuring has been in the offing for more than a year, long before the pandemic loomed. Debt has been the serial killer for so many companies, from Carillion to Thomas Cook. Unlike a lot of its rivals, 95% of its restaurants are understood to be profitable. The hope is this plan will be enough to strengthen Pizza Express's finances and put it on a more secure footing. But it will probably fall into the hands of its lenders as a result unless a buyer comes forward. Zoe Bowley, UK and Ireland managing director for Pizza Express, said that while the financial restructuring would be a ""positive step forward"", the closures would be ""incredibly sad for our Pizza Express family and we will do everything we can to support our teams at this time"". Many took to social media to comment. Some blamed investors for being greedy, while others said High Street chains needed more help: Allow Twitter content?

Previously, Pizza Express has said the majority of its restaurants are profitable. Pizza Express has heavy debts and last year was known to have started talks to put its debts of more than Â£1bn on more favourable terms. It is expected to announce a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) in the near future, which is an insolvency procedure that allows a company with debt problems to reach agreement with creditors regarding payment of all, or part of its debts. 1965:Pizza Express founder, the late Peter Boizot, brought a pizza oven from Napoli and a chef from Sicily to open his first restaurant in London's Soho. 1992:Mr Boizot grew his empire over the following almost-three decades before selling it for Â£15m to Hugh Osmond and Luke Johnson, the man who was - until recently - chairman of Patisserie Valerie. They floated it on the stock market the next year and ultimately sold out in 1997 when it was worth Â£150m. 2003:It was taken private again in a Â£278m deal by two private equity firms who then floated it two years later - although it lasted less than a year on the public markets before it was returned to private equity hands. 2014:It changed hands again, this time to be acquired for Â£900m by its current owner, Chinese private equity house Hony Capital. 2020:It has more than 600 restaurants globally: 454 in the UK, including five franchises; 19 in Ireland; 24 in Hong Kong; 6 in Singapore; 14 in UAE; 60 in China; and 49 other international sites operated by franchisees. Andy Pellington, group chief finance officer at Pizza Express, said: ""While we have had to make some very difficult decisions, none of which has been taken lightly, we are confident in the actions being taken to reduce the level of debt, create a more focused business and improve the operational performance, all of which puts us in a much stronger position."" Julian Cox, partner at law firm BLM said: ""Pizza Express is yet another household name that has been pushed to the brink by Covid-19. ""Whilst the government has attempted to encourage people through the doors with 'Eat Out to Help Out', the initiative is clearly not going to be enough to protect the sector in the long term.""

"Juan Carlos is under investigation in Spain, as well as in Switzerland Spain's former King Juan Carlos has left the country for an unknown destination, weeks after he was linked to an inquiry into alleged corruption. Juan Carlos, 82, announced the move on Monday in a letter to his son, Felipe, to whom he handed power six years ago. He said he would be available if prosecutors needed to interview him. In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened an investigation into the alleged involvement of Juan Carlos in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia. The former king had most likely already left when the letter was released on Monday, Spain's El PaÃ­s newspaper reports. It is unclear where Juan Carlos is, though some Spanish media report he is in the Dominican Republic. It is a humiliating exit for a king who had once seemed set to go down in history as the leader who skilfully guided Spain from dictatorship to democracy after the death of General Franco in 1975, BBC Europe correspondent Nick Beake says. Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune Spain ex-king probed over Saudi rail deal King Felipe renounces father's inheritance Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after nearly 40 years as king following a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. In the letter, the former monarch wrote that he was making the decision ""in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating"" and in the hope of allowing his son to carry out his functions as king with ""tranquillity"". ""Guided by the conviction to best serve the people of Spain, its institutions, and you as king, I inform you of my decision at this time to leave Spain. ""A decision I make with deep emotion but with great serenity,"" the letter said. King Felipe VI (right) has been trying to distance himself from his father Juan Carlos The statement from the Zarzuela palace said that King Felipe VI had conveyed ""his heartfelt respect and gratitude"" to his father for this decision. In March,King Felipe VI renounced the inheritance of his father.The royal palace also said at the time that Juan Carlos would stop receiving an annual grant of â¬194,000 ($228,000; Â£174,520). Spain's Supreme Court has said it aims to establish Juan Carlos's connection with the Saudi project after his abdication in June 2014. At that point he lost his immunity from prosecution. Spanish firms won a â¬6.7bn (Â£6bn) deal to build a Mecca-Medina rail link. This video can not be played King Juan Carlos, 76, has had health problems in recent years The probe involves Swiss banks too. Spanish anti-corruption officials suspect that the former king kept some undeclared funds in Switzerland, and a Swiss investigation is under way. The Spanish government has said that ""justice is equal for all"" and it would ""not interfere"" in the inquiry. Born in Rome, Italy, in 1938 Ascends the throne on 22 November 1975, two days after the death of fascist dictator Gen Francisco Franco Juan Carlos was widely admired for steering Spain to democracy during a difficult period But towards the end of his 39-year reign he drew growing criticism Abdicates on 18 June 2014 in favour of his son Felipe Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune Spain ex-king probed over Saudi rail deal King Felipe renounces father's inheritance Spanish princess cleared in tax trial Why is King Juan Carlos abdicating?

"This video can not be played A Linwood High School pupil is congratulated by his mum after receiving his results Thousands of Scottish school pupils have received worse results than they had been expecting after the country's exam body lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total. Exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers based on the pupil's performance over the school year. However, a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. Many pupils have spoken of their disappointment at being given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams, with some claiming they have suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Opposition politicians have warned that there will now be a ""deluge"" of appeals, and accused the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) of treating the professional judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by changing so many grades. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Live coverage: Results day for Scotland's school pupils How grades were worked out in the year with no exams About 138,000 students began receiving their results at 08:00 on Tuesday. The pass rate for National 5 was 81.1%, while the Higher pass rate was 78.9% and the Advanced Higher rate was 84.9%. In 2019, the National 5 pass rate was 78.2%, the Higher pass rate was 74.8% and the Advanced Higher rate was 79.4%. Most pupils take their Nationals when they are in their fourth year of secondary school. They can then stay at school for another two years and work towards Higher qualifications in their fifth year, and Advanced Highers in sixth year. Scottish school pupils traditionally find out their results earlier than those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who will receive their grades for A-levels on 13 August and GCSEs on 20 August. A total of 133,762 individual results were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) from the 511,070 initial estimates of grades that were submitted by teachers. Of these, only 9,198 of the estimates were adjusted up, while 124,564 were adjusted down. Almost all (96%) were adjusted by a single grade. If the results had purely been based on the estimates from teachers, pass rates at grades A-C would have increased by 10.4 percentage points for National 5, by 14 percentage points for Higher and by 13.4 percentage points for Advanced Higher. These estimated results would have led to a higher annual change than had ever been seen before in Scottish exam results if they had not been moderated by the SQA. SQA figures also showed that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, compared to only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. At National 5 level, the pass rate for the poorest pupils was 74% when teachers' estimates would have led to an 84.5% pass rate without moderation. For the least deprived, the 92.3% estimated pass rate fell to 87.1% after the SQA's moderation. The exams body insisted that the most deprived pupils had not suffered compared to previous years - and the Scottish government said the attainment gap has narrowed this year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher. ""But given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" The SQA said the most disadvantaged pupils had achieved better results this year than in 2019, with the number of passes also above the average for the past four years. A spokesman added: ""At Grades A to C, the attainment gap between the most and least disadvantaged young people is also narrower this year for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher than for last year or the average gap for the last four years."" This video can not be played John Swinney says national moderation played an 'important role' in grades Aiden from Falkirk said he had been predicted to get three As and a B in his Highers but was given a B and 3Cs, and has been encouraged by his teachers to appeal. The 17-year-old told the PA news agency that he believes he was penalised for being from a less affluent area. He added: ""I was very proud of the Scottish education system but after this I am really disappointed. ""I don't know how they can give me a B in modern studies because someone in my area got a B in modern studies at a similar level years ago, I just don't think that's fair."" The teenager also said he felt pupils and teachers had been ""left in the dark"" about how results had been awarded by the SQA, and what the appeals process is. Holyrood Secondary pupil Dionne celebrates her results with her dad John Another pupil, Lewis from Bishopbriggs, was given Bs for English and PE despite getting As in the prelim exams, and a D in computing despite getting a C in the prelim. Lewis said: ""I don't understand why the SQA are deciding our results when our teachers have a much better understanding of our work and progress. ""Even then, there is almost never a reason for moving someone down a grade from their predicted grade - it's been a shambles. ""Our teachers have even been emailing us saying they've not got a clue what's been going on."" But Dionne, a pupil at Holyrood Secondary in Glasgow, told BBC Breakfast that her results had been  ""exactly what I was hoping for"". ""It means I'm going to university and I'm just so happy. I can't believe it,"" she said. Her father John said he was ""so proud"" of his daughter, adding: ""She's done so much better than I could have ever done at school. It's been such a time of uncertainty and it's a massive wait over now.""

As in the rest of the UK, the grades of pupils who were unable to sit exams have been worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. Teachers were asked to place students within bands for each subject, and rank their pupils in order. These assessments were then checked by the SQA, which said grades had been moderated ""where appropriate"" to ""maintain national standards"". The SQA said it had sought to ""uphold the integrity and credibility"" of the system in its moderation, but that its efforts had been focused on ""ensuring fairness for all learners"". The exams body also said it would look at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment, but denied that a school's previous record could put pupils at either an advantage or a disadvantage. Where a pupil receives a lower grade than the one estimated by their teacher or lecturer, they will be able to usea free appeals process,external. You can read more about how the grades were calculated here The SQA gave many pupils lower grades than had been estimated for them by teachers Scottish Labour has accused the SQA of treating the judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by lowering the grades of so many pupils - which can damage their prospects for university or college. The party's education spokesman, Iain Gray, said: ""Worst of all, the SQA have done this on the basis of each school's past performance, marking the school not the pupil, and baking in the attainment gap. ""They were told that this would be grossly unfair and it is. The SQA will now be deluged with appeals. I hope they are ready to deal with them properly."" The Scottish Conservatives criticised the ""shambolic"" handling of the process by the SQA, and said it ""must honour its commitment and release the methodology it used to assess and award qualifications"". Its education spokesman, Jamie Greene, said: ""Without proper transparency the Scottish public will not have confidence in the process."" And Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens claimed that ""pupils are having their futures disadvantaged and it seems to be for no other reason than they school they go to"". He added: ""How can the SQA say the system is based on teacher judgement when in some schools they have ignored almost every professional judgement that teachers have made?"" The first minister said pupils deserved ""enormous credit"" for the way they had coped after exams were cancelled across the UK as schools closed and the country went into lockdown in March. Ms Sturgeon added: ""At a moment's notice you had to adapt to new forms of learning, your contact with friends and family was restricted, many of you missed out on a proper end to your final year, you didn't get to sit exams. ""Of course, you're now having to think about your future in a time of real economic uncertainty. ""All of that has been really tough and we don't underestimate how tough that has been, and I know that for some of you there will be difficult decisions that lie ahead.""

"BP has halved its shareholder dividend and posted a $6.7bn quarterly loss after the coronavirus pandemic hit global demand for oil. The dividend news is another blow for pension funds and private investors who have seen a string of firms cut or halt payouts. The loss was largely due to BP writing down the value of its assetsafter it cut its oil price forecasts. BP said the outlook for oil prices and demand was ""challenging and uncertain"". It also warned that the pandemic could weigh on the global economy for a ""sustained period"". In the short-term, BP said it expected demand for oil could be up to nine million barrels per day lower compared to last year. It has already announced it will cut 10,000 jobs, with as many as 2,000 set to be lost in the UK. Who wins and who loses when oil prices fall? Shell cuts dividend for first time since WW2 Oil prices have plunged after the coronavirus virtually shut down major economies. In April, the price turned negative for the first time in history, meaning producers had to pay buyers to take oil off their hands over fear storage capacity could run out. BP's loss for the three months to June compares to a $2.8bn profit in the same period last year. The oil giant said its dividend would halve to 5.25 cents a share, compared to 10.5 cents in the first quarter. It follows a similar, earlier move by rival Royal Dutch Shell which cut its first quarter dividend in April - the first reduction to its shareholder payment since the Second World War. The dividend blows for investors and retirement savers just keep on coming. After Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II and Britain's banks suspended their payouts, BP has now halved its dividend - its first cut for more than a decade. That is a particularly hard blow for UK pension funds and the army of pensioner investors who rely on the payouts. BP traditionally generates the largest dividend payment among the big blue chip FTSE 100 giants. Dividend watchers now reckon the total amount of payouts by British firms will fall by two-fifths in 2020. Link Group's Dividend Monitor shows that dividends fell by a 57% in the second quarter of the year as 176 companies cancelled payouts and 30 more have cut them. That's not disastrous for investors, but it will be painful. Despite BP's loss and a lower dividend, the company's share price rose by 6.26% to 298.6p as it announced a new strategy. BP said it wanted to ""pivot"" from being a traditional oil company to an ""integrated energy company"" and said it expects to achieve ""net zero"" carbon emissions for the company by 2050. Over the next decade, BP forecasts that oil and gas production will fall by at least one million barrels of oil a day, or 40% compared to 2019. It plans to invest in renewables, bioenergy and as well as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology. Bernard Looney, who took over as BP chief executive in February, said: ""This coming decade is critical for the world in the fight against climate change, and to drive the necessary change in global energy systems will require action from everyone.""

Dr Emmanual Okpo from NHS Grampian says they're working to find everyone connected: ""Every individual who has received a detected result, we will contact. They should just be patient, and sit at home, self isolate, and we will get to them."" Several pubs in Aberdeen have announced closures, including Hawthorn Bar where this cluster originated.

secretary of Scotlandâs largest teachers union the EIS, says many teachers who have had estimates overturned are angry. While the appeals process might address some anomalies, ""a number of teachers will feel their estimates have been undermined by a computer"", he says. When schools mark assessments themselves there can be ""a bit of positive bias"",  Mr Flanagan says, but not to the extent that it would change an entire grade. He expects everyone
whose estimate has not been upheld will be making  appeals, and if those are upheld, it would place ""a huge question"" over the SQA's modelling. Ainsley Dougan shared with us how she felt on her exam results day, explaining she was ""prepared for the worst"".

Exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers based on the pupil's performance over the school year.

Today's live page was edited by Flora Dury and Sarah Collerton, and written by Sophie Williams, Vicky Bisset, Mary O'Connor, Becky Morton and Holly Honderich. And here are today's top stories from around the world: We'll be pausing our live coverage of Covid-19-related news shortly but here's a quick recap of the main stories from the UK today:  Zimbabwe's Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga has been named as the country's new health minister, a month after his predecessor, Obadiah Moyo, was ousted over a scandal involving coronavirus medical supplies. Moyo was arrested in late June on charges of corruption over a $20m (Â£16m) contract awarded to a Hungary-registered firm, allegedly without going through proper processes. Zimbabwe as seen a relatively low number of coronavirus cases, but doctors say the real number is higher. The country is facing a number of crises and international criticism over its response to anti-corruption protests. Last month, meanwhile, the UN food agency said nearly two-thirds of the population would need food aid by the end of the year because of a poor harvest, rampant inflation and a growing coronavirus problem. Two people wear masks at a market in Zimbabwe last month Across the US, prisons have become Covid-19 hotspots. Overcrowding, cramped quarters and antiquated facilities make social distancing extremely difficult, and curbing an outbreak nearly impossible. And outbreaks in prisons can also lead to infections in neighbouring communities, according to a new study in Health Affairs. In Illinois, researchers from Harvard University's Department of Anthropology and the Center National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris found that more than 4,700 coronavirus cases up until mid-April were associated with 2,129 individuals going through Chicago's Cook County Jail in March. The jail may be linked with more than 15% of all documented cases in the city and state, the researchers said. ""Existing conditions in jails and penitentiaries make infection control particularly difficult, putting inmates at unconscionable and perhaps unconstitutional risk,"" they wrote. The Chicago jail was the largest recorded source of spread of the coronavirus before it was surpassed by an Ohio state prison, according to the researchers. Read more about the spread of Covid in US prisons, and how one California institution went from zero cases in May to one of the worst outbreaks in the country. This video can not be played NHS contact tracing: How does it stop coronavirus? Contact tracing aims to stop the spread of coronavirus as lockdown measures are lifted. There are separate systems in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but the principles are broadly the same: You can read more about contact tracinghere. A further six coronavirus deaths have been recorded by NHS England, bringing the total number of people who have died in hospitals in England with the virus to 29,358. Another five deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. UK-wide figures cover deaths across all settings, including in care homes and the community, and use a different time frame. US President Donald Trump's campaign sent an email to his supporters, encouraging them to don face masks, as case numbers surge across the country. ""We are all in this together, and while I know there has been some confusion surrounding the usage of face masks, I think it's something we should all try to do when we are not able to be socially distanced from others,"" said the email, sent on Monday and signed by Trump. ""I don't love wearing them either,"" he wrote, but they may help get the US back on track faster. The Republican president wore a mask in public for the first time in July, after resisting wearing one. Donning facial coverings amid the outbreak has become highly politicised in the US. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters are about twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that masks should be worn all the time. A further 89 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died with coronavirus to 46,299. The latest government figures,externalalso show 670 new cases have been recorded. This video can not be played The head of England's contact tracing service has insisted it is ""extremely effective"",after a study warned it may be inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools reopen. Challenged over whether the fact individual local authorities such as Blackburn and Sandwell had set up their own contact tracing system represented a failure of the national service, Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She added that local approaches were ""entirely complementary"" to the national system. ""What NHS Test and Trace is doing
is allowing us to identify areas where the virus is spreading more freely where
we do need to take targeted local action,"" she said. Asked when England's contact tracing app -which was originally expected months ago- would be available, she said it would be launched ""soon"". Police in Washington DC are warning of an increase in vehicle thefts targeting delivery drivers across the city. The citywide notice follows jumps in car thefts across the US since the start of the country's coronavirus outbreak as residents are staying home more and using their cars less. This year, car theft surged by 63% in New York and nearly 17% in Los Angeles from 1 January through mid-May, compared with the same period last year, according to the Associated Press. Police have said the rise is also linked to increased reliance on food delivery by residents staying inside amid the pandemic. Worldwide Google searches for âfood deliveryâ and âlocal foodâ reached all-time highs in April. Nichola MandilBBC News, Juba South Sudan's health ministry says about 78 frontline healthcare workers have tested positive for Covid-19. One male healthcare worker has died, according to a health official. ""It is very unfortunate to mention that we have lost one of the healthcare workers. He used to work at Juba Teaching Hospital, he is one of the people that were affected by the virus and this is the only record we have as a fatality amongst healthcare workers,"" Dr Matthew Tut told journalists in the capital, Juba. Last month, eight health workers resigned because of pressure from their families, who expressed concerns that they might bring the virus home and infect their relatives. Black LGBT people in the US are more
likely to have lost work or had their hours reduced due to the pandemic,according to a study by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC),external. The report also found that black LGBT
people are three times more likely to ask for an extension on their rent than
the general population. Nearly a third of black LGBT people surveyed
had their hours cut due to the pandemic while for non-gay and non-trans black
people the rate was less than one quarter. When it came to job losses, 18% of
black gay and trans people said they had lost their jobs compared to 12% of the
general population. The US has the widest gap in US
unemployment rates between black and white people in five years, according to Reuters
news agency. âEven as black communities, especially
black trans communities, across the country are reckoning with racism and
violence, black LGBT people are also being disproportionately impacted by
Covid-19,â HRC President Alphonso David said. World number two Rafael Nadal was among those who planned to take part The Madrid Open has been cancelled as coronavirus cases continue to rise in Spain. Spain's healthy ministry had advised the organisers aganst proceeding with the tournment, which was due to begin on 12 September, because of the city's ""deteriorating"" coronavirus situation. ""We have no choice but to cancel the tournament due to the complex situation that Covid-19 continues to generate in every regard,"" the organisers said. Spain has recorded more than 302,000 cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and 28,498 deaths, figures released on Tuesday show, with the rate of infection rising rapidly in the country. The Madrid Open is not the only major sporting event to face disruption amid the pandemic, with a range of events - including the Tokyo 2020 Olympics - either postponed or cancelled this year.Find out more here. Reality Check Thankfully, there are fewer people dying than you would usually expect for this time of year. Todayâs statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show in the week to 24 July, there were 161fewer deaths registered in England and Wales,externalthan has been the case on average for the last five years. They call that having negative excess deaths. There have now been negative excess deaths overall for six weeks in a row. The ONS also breaks down the deaths by where they occur - there were negative excess deaths in hospitals and care homes. But in private homes, there have been excess deaths every week since the pandemic began. In the week ending 24 July, there were 727 excess deaths in private homes registered, which is more than 100 a day. What this means is that while we are seeing fewer deaths than you would expect to see in hospitals and care homes, there are considerably more people dying at home than you would expect. Carers in France will each receive a payment of up to â¬1,000 (Â£900; $1,177), President Emmanuel Macron has announced. Speaking during a visit to the city of Toulon on Tuesday, Macron paid tribute to the contribution of carers working with the elderly and disabled during the pandemic. Last month the government approved pay rises for health workers worth â¬8bn (Â£7.2bn; $9bn). France has been among the worst-affected countries in Europe, with more than 30,000 deaths and almost 230,000 infections. The US top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned of a ""really bad situation"" if the country does not bring its daily coronavirus case count down to 10,000 by September. The US is currently recording roughly 50,000 to 60,000 cases each day, Dr Fauci said to NBC News, suggesting the country is ""right in the middle of the first wave"". ""If we don't get them down, then we're going to have a really bad situation in the fall,"" Dr Fauci said. Getting the virus under control will be complicated by the onset of colder temperatures and the typical flu season, he said. There have been more than 4.7 million cases recorded in the US so far, with 155,515 deaths. While some former hot spots have begun to curb infection rates, case numbers continue to surge throughout the country. The international police body Interpol has warned of the ""alarming"" threat posed by cyber criminals since the coronavirus crisis began earlier this year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, criminals have begun to shift their focus from individuals and small businesses to governments and critical infrastructure, Interpol said in a new report. The shift to working from home has also left businesses more vulnerable to attacks, as criminals exploit ""increased security vulnerabilities to steal data, generate profits and cause disruption"". The nature of scams has also evolved to take advantage of the pandemic, with an increase in Covid-19 themed phishing emails, often impersonating health authorities, the report found. Other threats involve the use of deliberately misleading domain names and the use of malicious software (known as malware) and ransomware, which blocks a user's access until a sum of of money is paid. The number of coronavirus cases linked to a pub in Aberdeen has risen to 32 - an increase of five since Monday. The cluster, linked to people who visited the Hawthorn Bar on 26 July, emerged on Sunday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 120 close contacts - who must self-isolate for 14 days - had been identified through the country's contact tracing system. More than 4,000 people have signedan open letter,externalagainst sweeping changes to London's Southbank Centre, which they say will result in ""irrevocable damage"" to its future. Last month the venue, which is the UK's largest arts and culture organisation, began a consultation on plans to make 365 people redundant - more than 60% of its workforce. The letter says the job losses will disproportionately affect lowest-paid staff, which include a high proportion of young people, people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and people with disabilities. According to the letter, staff have been told that when it reopens the centre's programme of contemporary art exhibitions, music and literature events will be allocated just 10% of capacity, with 90% reserved for rental space. The Hayward Gallery, which is based at the centre, reopened earlier this month, but the rest of its venues, including the Royal Festival Hall and the National Poetry Library, remain closed.

"The number of cases linked to a bar in Aberdeen has risen to 32, says NHS Grampian The first minister warns that if you are traced and linked to any cluster it is ""non-negotiable"" that you self-isolate for 14 days Thousands of pupils in Scotland have received their results and for the first time they are based on no formal exams Pass rates for National 4 and 5; Highers and Advanced Highers were up on last year, but a quarter of estimates were adjusted by the exams body with the majority going down The Scottish Qualifications Authority says results were based on a pupil's performance throughout the year and not on one particular test The results come a week before schools in Scotland are due to open fully - the first in the UK to do so For the 19th day in a row, there have been no new deaths as a result of a positive test BBC Scotland News A weekly update on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths in Scotland. That concludes our live coverage of all the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland today. We'll be back in the morning. Have a good evening meantime and stay safe. David ShanksBBC Scotland reporter The Hawthorn Bar will be temporarily closing The number of cases of coronavirus linked to an Aberdeen pub has risen to 32 after the first minister issued a warning about the outbreak. 120 people have been contacted by Test and Protect teams. This is down from yesterday, but only because three people were instead included in the list of positive tests. Dr Emmanual Okpo from NHS Grampian says they're working to find everyone connected: ""Every individual who has received a detected result, we will contact. They should just be patient, and sit at home, self isolate, and we will get to them."" Several pubs in Aberdeen have announced closures, including Hawthorn Bar where this cluster originated. Director at Siberia bar, Stuart McPhee, told us today they will be closing. He said: ""There are so many variables that there is an element of risk. We manage our own risk and that at the moment is deemed to be too high."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Larry Flanagan, general
secretary of Scotlandâs largest teachers union the EIS, says many teachers who have had estimates overturned are angry. While the appeals process might address some anomalies, ""a number of teachers will feel their estimates have been undermined by a computer"", he says. When schools mark assessments themselves there can be ""a bit of positive bias"",  Mr Flanagan says, but not to the extent that it would change an entire grade. He expects everyone
whose estimate has not been upheld will be making  appeals, and if those are upheld, it would place ""a huge question"" over the SQA's modelling. Ainsley Dougan shared with us how she felt on her exam results day, explaining she was ""prepared for the worst"". Ainsley left school after fifth year and went on to college, before starting her own personal training business. She also had some tough advice for her former self about school and exams.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney reiterates that 75% of teacher estimates were accepted. But had they all been accepted there would have been questions about the increase in pass rates, he says. ""Fairness to all learners was at the heart of the approach that was selected so that regardless of your circumstances around the country, you would be treated with fairness,"" the deputy first minister insists. These are a set of results which are robust, command confidence and ensure the generation of 2020 can say their results have equal validity to others, he says. On appeals, Mr Swinney confirms those who need grades to get into college or university in September will be prioritised. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Iain Gray, Scottish Labourâs education spokesman, said the SQA and John Swinney were warned not to downgrade results
based on historic performance of their school ""and that is exactly what they have
done"". While students and
teachers have risen to the challenge of a very difficult year, he says, many pupils have been ""ill-served"" by the moderation scheme
the SQA used. ""If we have a system of
teacher assessments, we have to trust those teacher assessments, as has
happened in other countries like France,"" says Mr Gray. Pupils in more deprived areas were
twice as likely to have their grades reduced than contemporaries in
schools in better-off parts of Scotland, he ventures. We cannot get away from the fundamental unfairness that if you are a pupil at a school which historically has not done well, that has been used to downgrade your results. The reality of that for individuals is significant.â Iain Gray MSP, Scottish Labour Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Xander from Drumchapel received 3 As and 2 Bs in his Highers today, but was predicted to get all As by his teachers. He says: ""It is a bit annoying because I know if I'd taken the exam I would have got an A in it."" He believes he was marked down because of how his school as a whole has performed in previous years. His mum Helen adds: ""I don't think the kids should be penalised because of where they come from."" Erin Bartley, who has been answering calls to the Skills Development Scotland helpline all day, says she has heard of ""a lot of anomalies"" relating to prelim grades versus final grades. She says many are therefore planning to appeal. The World Health Organization has urged Russia to follow international guidelines for producing a vaccine against Covid-19 after the country said it would begin vaccinations in October. ""Sometimes individual researchers claim they have found something, which is of course, as such, great news,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters on Tuesday. ""But between finding or having a clue of maybe having a vaccine that works, and having gone through all the stages, is a big difference."" Last week, the Russian government announced it was preparing to begin mass vaccinations. However, the Russian vaccine is not among the WHO's list of six vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials, which involve more widespread testing in humans.

"People have been laying candles and flowers for the girl at the scene of the shooting The death of a 12-year-old girl by a stray bullet in Sweden has sparked outrage and reignited debates over its handling of gang-related violence. The unnamed girl was killed in a drive-by shooting next to a petrol station on Sunday, according to local media. Police have launched an investigation but are yet to make any arrests. Officials have vowed to further crack down on violent crime. Incidents involving gangs have risen in recent years. Police were called to the scene of the shooting, south of Stockholm, in the early hours of Sunday morning. Details of what happened have not been officially confirmed, but local media outlets reported that the gunmen had been aiming at two members of a criminal gang, and had not intended to shoot the child. People placed flowers and candles at the scene on Monday, with some calling for tougher action on gang violence in the country. ""This can't happen again. It's a 12-year-old girl,"" one woman told AFP news agency. Hundred explosions in Sweden: What's going on? Sweden's deadly problem with hand grenades Justice Minister Morgan Johansson told local news agency TT he was dismayed and disgusted by the girl's death, as he pledged ""more police and harsher sentences"". National police chief Anders Thornberg said authorities would ""set things right when it comes to increasingly serious violence in society"", while opposition MP Johan Forssell said there needed to be a re-think ""to make Sweden safer."" Sweden announced last year that it had set up a special task force to combat gang violence in the country amid a rise in incidents. Police have been given additional surveillance powers and sentences for drugs and weapons-related crimes have been increased in recent years. Twenty people have been killed in 163 shootings in the first six months of 2020, according to police data. In 2019, 42 people were killed in 334 reported shootings.

The US president said he made a demand for a ""substantial portion"" of the purchase price in a phone call at the weekend with Microsoft's boss. He also warned he will ban the app, which is owned by China's ByteDance, on 15 September if there is no deal. ByteDance is under pressure to sell its US business after Mr Trump threatened a crackdown on Chinese tech companies. Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? How would the US go about banning TikTok? The Trump administration has accused TikTok and others of providing data to the Chinese government, which Beijing and TikTok deny. ""The United States should get a very large percentage of that price, because we're making it possible,"" Mr Trump said. This video can not be played What is TikTok? ""It would come from the sale, which nobody else would be thinking about but me, but that's the way I think, and I think it's very fair,"" he added. The request for payment to the US Treasury further complicated negotiations as legal experts highlighted that such a demand to secure regulatory approval for a takeover deal would be highly unorthodox. Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper, said generally ""the government doesn't have the authority to take a cut of a private deal through"" the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is the inter-agency committee that reviews some foreign investments in the US. The state-run China Daily newspaper said on Tuesday that Beijing would not accept the ""theft"" of a Chinese technology company. It also warned in an editorial that China had ""plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab"". Charlotte Jee, a reporter at MIT Technology Review, a magazine owned by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Mr Trump's comments were ""pretty astonishing"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""I hate to say this but it is kind of almost Mafia-like behaviour - threatening a ban which pushes down the price then saying 'oh we should get a cut of that deal afterwards to say thank you for what we've done there'. ""It is extraordinary behaviour as well because last week we had lawmakers in the UStrying to look at whether tech companies are too bigand now we've got Trump trying to make one of them even bigger so it is a really, really bizarre situation to be in."" Talks over a potential deal looked to have been derailed on Friday when Mr Trump said he opposed Microsoft buying TikTok's US business. While Mr Trump now giving his approval to a possible takeover is a major shift in the White House's position, the tight deadline for talks is another major hurdle for any potential deal. By Dearbail Jordan, business correspondent Former FBI director James Comey once said that dealing with Donald Trump gave him ""flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob"". The US president has certainly made TikTok an offer it can't refuse. If the video app doesn't break away from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and sell its US operation to Microsoft, Mr Trump will simply ban it - putting TikTok's access to its 80 million active American users in jeopardy. Mr Trump has already flexed his muscles against other Chinese firms, such as Huawei. But what makes the situation with TikTok unprecedented is the demand for a cut of the sale price. The US Treasury has not explained how this extraordinary demand for a cut of a private transaction would work. Mr Trump reckons the government should get a big slice of the pie because ""we're making it possible"". However, the deal wouldn't be happening in the first place but for his administration's claim that the likes of TikTok are feeding users' data directly to the Chinese Communist Party. Beneath the president's bombast, perhaps this is simply payback for the US and its companies,some of whom claim China has stolen intellectual property from them,external. Perhaps Mr Trump is just doing outwardly what some governments have been doing for years. But one thing is certain, Mr Trump's demand for payment has muddied the waters in an already fraught situation. TikTok's US operations ""will close down on September 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal so the Treasuryâ¦ of the United States gets a lot of money,"" he said. As well as TikTok's US business, Microsoft is also in talks to buy its operations in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - countries that make up four of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. The UK is also a member of the alliance and there has been speculation that TikTok could base its global headquarters in London, joining tech giants such as Google which has a major presence in the capital.

"This video can not be played A Linwood High School pupil is congratulated by his mum after receiving his results Thousands of Scottish school pupils have received worse results than they had been expecting after the country's exam body lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total. Exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus. Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers based on the pupil's performance over the school year. However, a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated. Many pupils have spoken of their disappointment at being given lower grades than they had achieved in prelim exams, with some claiming they have suffered because they are from less affluent areas. Opposition politicians have warned that there will now be a ""deluge"" of appeals, and accused the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) of treating the professional judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by changing so many grades. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Live coverage: Results day for Scotland's school pupils How grades were worked out in the year with no exams About 138,000 students began receiving their results at 08:00 on Tuesday. The pass rate for National 5 was 81.1%, while the Higher pass rate was 78.9% and the Advanced Higher rate was 84.9%. In 2019, the National 5 pass rate was 78.2%, the Higher pass rate was 74.8% and the Advanced Higher rate was 79.4%. Most pupils take their Nationals when they are in their fourth year of secondary school. They can then stay at school for another two years and work towards Higher qualifications in their fifth year, and Advanced Highers in sixth year. Scottish school pupils traditionally find out their results earlier than those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who will receive their grades for A-levels on 13 August and GCSEs on 20 August. A total of 133,762 individual results were adjusted by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) from the 511,070 initial estimates of grades that were submitted by teachers. Of these, only 9,198 of the estimates were adjusted up, while 124,564 were adjusted down. Almost all (96%) were adjusted by a single grade. If the results had purely been based on the estimates from teachers, pass rates at grades A-C would have increased by 10.4 percentage points for National 5, by 14 percentage points for Higher and by 13.4 percentage points for Advanced Higher. These estimated results would have led to a higher annual change than had ever been seen before in Scottish exam results if they had not been moderated by the SQA. SQA figures also showed that the Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, compared to only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. At National 5 level, the pass rate for the poorest pupils was 74% when teachers' estimates would have led to an 84.5% pass rate without moderation. For the least deprived, the 92.3% estimated pass rate fell to 87.1% after the SQA's moderation. The exams body insisted that the most deprived pupils had not suffered compared to previous years - and the Scottish government said the attainment gap has narrowed this year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher. ""But given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" The SQA said the most disadvantaged pupils had achieved better results this year than in 2019, with the number of passes also above the average for the past four years. A spokesman added: ""At Grades A to C, the attainment gap between the most and least disadvantaged young people is also narrower this year for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher than for last year or the average gap for the last four years."" This video can not be played John Swinney says national moderation played an 'important role' in grades Aiden from Falkirk said he had been predicted to get three As and a B in his Highers but was given a B and 3Cs, and has been encouraged by his teachers to appeal. The 17-year-old told the PA news agency that he believes he was penalised for being from a less affluent area. He added: ""I was very proud of the Scottish education system but after this I am really disappointed. ""I don't know how they can give me a B in modern studies because someone in my area got a B in modern studies at a similar level years ago, I just don't think that's fair."" The teenager also said he felt pupils and teachers had been ""left in the dark"" about how results had been awarded by the SQA, and what the appeals process is. Holyrood Secondary pupil Dionne celebrates her results with her dad John Another pupil, Lewis from Bishopbriggs, was given Bs for English and PE despite getting As in the prelim exams, and a D in computing despite getting a C in the prelim. Lewis said: ""I don't understand why the SQA are deciding our results when our teachers have a much better understanding of our work and progress. ""Even then, there is almost never a reason for moving someone down a grade from their predicted grade - it's been a shambles. ""Our teachers have even been emailing us saying they've not got a clue what's been going on."" But Dionne, a pupil at Holyrood Secondary in Glasgow, told BBC Breakfast that her results had been  ""exactly what I was hoping for"". ""It means I'm going to university and I'm just so happy. I can't believe it,"" she said. Her father John said he was ""so proud"" of his daughter, adding: ""She's done so much better than I could have ever done at school. It's been such a time of uncertainty and it's a massive wait over now.""

James Russell, from SDS, said this year was ""unlike any other"" and that it was understandable that young people and their families would be feeling more anxious than usual. ""Our advice and support is available and our message is if your results aren't what you expected, don't worry - you have lots of options,"" he said. The#NoWrongPath campaign,externalis encouraging people to share their own stories on social media to highlight the different paths available to young people who may be feeling disheartened by their results.

Support and advice is also available onthe SQA website,externaland onBBC Bitesize. Young people can also call Childline on0800 1111or get advice about exam resultson its website,external. As in the rest of the UK, the grades of pupils who were unable to sit exams have been worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. Teachers were asked to place students within bands for each subject, and rank their pupils in order. These assessments were then checked by the SQA, which said grades had been moderated ""where appropriate"" to ""maintain national standards"". The SQA said it had sought to ""uphold the integrity and credibility"" of the system in its moderation, but that its efforts had been focused on ""ensuring fairness for all learners"". The exams body also said it would look at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment, but denied that a school's previous record could put pupils at either an advantage or a disadvantage. Where a pupil receives a lower grade than the one estimated by their teacher or lecturer, they will be able to usea free appeals process,external. You can read more about how the grades were calculated here The SQA gave many pupils lower grades than had been estimated for them by teachers Scottish Labour has accused the SQA of treating the judgement of teachers with ""contempt"" by lowering the grades of so many pupils - which can damage their prospects for university or college. The party's education spokesman, Iain Gray, said: ""Worst of all, the SQA have done this on the basis of each school's past performance, marking the school not the pupil, and baking in the attainment gap. ""They were told that this would be grossly unfair and it is. The SQA will now be deluged with appeals. I hope they are ready to deal with them properly."" The Scottish Conservatives criticised the ""shambolic"" handling of the process by the SQA, and said it ""must honour its commitment and release the methodology it used to assess and award qualifications"". Its education spokesman, Jamie Greene, said: ""Without proper transparency the Scottish public will not have confidence in the process."" And Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens claimed that ""pupils are having their futures disadvantaged and it seems to be for no other reason than they school they go to"". He added: ""How can the SQA say the system is based on teacher judgement when in some schools they have ignored almost every professional judgement that teachers have made?"" The first minister said pupils deserved ""enormous credit"" for the way they had coped after exams were cancelled across the UK as schools closed and the country went into lockdown in March. Ms Sturgeon added: ""At a moment's notice you had to adapt to new forms of learning, your contact with friends and family was restricted, many of you missed out on a proper end to your final year, you didn't get to sit exams. ""Of course, you're now having to think about your future in a time of real economic uncertainty. ""All of that has been really tough and we don't underestimate how tough that has been, and I know that for some of you there will be difficult decisions that lie ahead.""

"The WHO chief said progress is being made in the search for a vaccine, but urged caution The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that while there is hope for a vaccine against Covid-19, one might never be found. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing there was ""no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be"". Mr Tedros implored people around the world to comply with measures such as social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing, saying: ""Do it all."" Globally, more than 18 million Covid-19 infections have been recorded. The death toll stands at 689,000, with both figures given by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. The man at the heart of the coronavirus fight How close to developing a vaccine are we? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? Speaking from its headquarters in Geneva, the WHO chief said work on immunisation was progressing. ""A number of vaccines are now in phase 3 clinical trials, and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection. ""However, there is no silver bullet at the moment, and there might never be,"" Mr Tedros warned. ""For now, stopping outbreaks comes down to the basics of public health and disease control: testing, isolating and treating patients, and tracing and quarantining their contacts."" Mr Tedros said that mothers with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection should be encouraged to continue breastfeeding. The benefits, he said, ""substantially"" outweighed the risks of infection. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Meanwhile, the first stage of a WHO investigation into the possible source of the outbreak in China is now complete, he said. Infectious disease experts believe the virus initially jumped from animals to humans and attention has focused on a wet market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the Covid-19 pandemic began. An advance team probing the source has concluded its mission and will be followed by a larger WHO-led international group, including Chinese experts. It is not yet known when it will commence. In other developments: The Australian city of Melbourne is shutting down shops, factories and other non-essential businesses as authorities fight a second wave of coronavirus.A night-time curfew has been imposed on the city's five million residentsas part of measures to try to curb the spread of the disease. At least 41 passengers and crew on a Norwegian cruise ship have tested positive for Covid-19, officials say. Hundreds more passengers who travelled on the MS Roald Amundsen are in quarantine and awaiting test results. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Iran is nearly three times higher than Iran's government claims, a BBC Persian service investigation has found.

"Current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools in the UK reopen, scientists have warned. Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children, they say. Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important - but more work was needed to keep the virus in check. The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was ""already delivering"" and on the right track for future. Baroness Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was ""well within the bounds"" of what the researchers ""are saying is necessary"". The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems. Asked about the estimate that only 50% of contacts are being traced in England, Simon Clarke, minister for regional growth, told the BBC government figures were higher. He said NHS test and trace is ""maturing all the time"" and getting children back to school in the autumn is a ""top priority"" that the government would not ""be willing to trade"". ""You're building an entirely new infrastructure which there's no precedent for,"" he said. ""But we're confident it is working, we're confident that it will continue to improve, and we're confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn."" Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid-19, said the virus is ""capable of surging back really quickly"" and stressed the importance of being able to trace, test and isolate people. ""If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they're dealt with quickly and life can go on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He later said he thinks Britain ""will do really well"" because there is ""really good attention to where the virus is locally"" and a lot of ""public engagement in getting on top of it"". A government spokesman said local authorities will ""be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases"". LOCKDOWN LIMIT:Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities. The study assumes childrenare less likely to catch- and therefore spread - coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home. As first reported in June, the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective test-and-trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown. The study,now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health,external, shows a second wave could be prevented if: both 75% of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68% of their contacts traced or both 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts traced However, the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short. They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested, they say this also appears too low. ""It is not achieving the levels we have modelled. It doesn't look good enough to me,"" said Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, added: ""With UK schools reopening fully in September, prevention of a second wave will require a major scale-up of testing to test 75% of symptomatic infections - combined with tracing of 68% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases."" How test-and-trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine Postcode search: See case numbers in your area GCSE students allowed to drop poetry in 2021 exams Schools will be ready for September - minister Schools have been shut around the world as countries used lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19.

The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has said ""we are near the limit"" of what we can do without causing a resurgence. The individual nations of the UK have their own contact tracing systems. The government said NHS test and trace in England has reached 80% of those testing positive and traced over 75% of their contacts. The Welsh government said its advisory group recommended that schools open in September with all pupils present on site, and ""we should be aiming to trace an estimated 80% of contacts, at least 35% of which are to be traced within 24 hours"". Since 21 June, 90% of close contacts were reached by the service,according to Welsh government figures,external. A Scottish government spokesperson said guidance set out ""a number of specific risk-mitigation measures that will need to be introduced"" including an ""enhanced surveillance programme"".
