""There have been other notable heatwaves but none affecting such a large area of the country."" A large swathe of New South Wales is bearing the brunt of the heat, with temperatures also soaring in parts of Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory.

Meteorologists say that the heatwave has broken heat records at more than 10 places around Australia, largely central inland locations. The record-setters included the outback town of Tarcoola in South Australia which soared to 49C on Tuesday, and Port Augusta in South Australia which reached 48.9C. How 'one-third' of a bat population died in two days Sixteen people in South Australia were admitted to hospital due to the heat on Wednesday, the state government said.

Some people also shared their attempts to cool down on social media, including one Reddit user who wrote that he was ""refrigerating my pyjamas to survive the stuffiness of my bedroom"". Dozens of bushfires were burning across Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales on Thursday in conditions exacerbated by the heat and drought. At Cobar's Empire Hotel, temperatures reached 50C on Friday. ""It's very difficult but we push through,"" bar attendant Britney-Lee Fazulla told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. She said it was the worst heatwave she'd experienced. There were also reports of mass deaths in native bat colonies in New South Wales, and fruit orchards spoiling under the Sun.

"Rezvan Habibimarand and Mozaffar Saberi A lawyer for an elderly Iranian couple fighting removal from the UK has said they face spending ""living the rest of their days without their family"". Mozaffar Saberi, 83, and Rezvan Habibimarand, 73, bought their Edinburgh flat in the late 1970s. While they have lived in the city on and off for 40 years, they never sought UK citizenship. Their legal team claim the couple should be allowed to remain on human rights grounds. They argue that they depend on support from nearby family and also play an important role caring for their severely autistic grandson. The Home Office has said they have no right to remain. Their final appeal against removal is due on 25 February. Since April 2000, Mr Saberi and Ms Habibimarand have held several visitors visas. However, with their own health deteriorating and their desire to watch their 11 grandchildren grow up, they made a human rights application to stay in the UK in April 2013. Rezvan Habibimarand and Mozaffar Saberi (seventh and eighth from right) and son Navid Saberi (second from left) at a family wedding It came less than a year after immigration rules were tightened by then Home Secretary Theresa May. Two human rights applications have been refused by the Home Office. The couple's son Navid Saberi told BBC Scotland: ""We are not coping very well. It is shocking the level of hostility we get from Home Office - you are treated not like a human, and like a number."" A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""All UK visa applications are considered on their individual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules."" Prior to 2012 the couple could have applied to stay under the adult dependant relative rule, which was tightened to reduce ""net migration"". John Vassiliou, a partner at McGill & Co Solicitors who are handling their case, said it has become ""impossible"" for anyone to bring parents into the UK permanently. He said: ""The criteria that have to be satisfied are so severe that I have yet to meet anyone who has been able to meet them. ""And there are difficulties with visiting Iran, you can't just pop over on holiday. ""Mozaffar and Rezvan would struggle greatly - they would have to live out their lives without their children and grandchildren, who are all British citizens. ""They're showing normal things for people their age - frailty, reduced mobility, they take various medications. They do rely heavily on their children, but they still play a very important part in their children's lives on an emotional level. ""A 70 and 80-year-old living out the rest of their days there without their family is really sad."" He said the couple also look after their non-verbal teenage grandson to help their daughter, who is a single parent and an NHS nurse. The boy's condition means he can only communicate using a tablet and is susceptible to high stress levels, particularly around strangers. Months before the couple's second application, a child psychology expert told the Home Office they supported Mozaffar and Rezvan staying in Scotland in a report. The psychologist concluded: ""His grandparents and their residence are essential parts of his social, psychological and physical environment."" However, the second application from October 2016 was refused - a move that prompted the couple's legal team to launch a judicial review. The Home Office conceded and reconsidered the evidence on their grandson's autism, but again refused the application. In a letter, officials questioned the couple's ability to care for their grandson when ""you both are elderly and require help yourselves"". They also suggested the boy's mother give up work and ""seek assistance from social services"". The letter concludes the couple's applications ""show total disregard for the immigration laws of the UK"". Mr Vassiliou branded the letter's contents ""galling"". On the couple's grandson, he said: ""He relies on his grandparents for emotional care. When he's with them, he's relaxed, calm and happy, and when he's without them, he is not. ""Removal would impact everyone in their family, particularly the child and his mother. I don't know if he would understand or know why his grandparents suddenly aren't there."" Mr Saberi's son added: ""They asked my sister to seek benefits and use public money which is absolutely shocking. We are all working really hard to provide care, we don't want public funds - that's our obligation and we're happy to do that.""They have an emotional connection to all of us - they have three generations here. ""The level of care we provide for them here cannot be provided for them in Iran. They are elderly, if they go back to Iran that emotional and psychological dependency, which is mutual, would not be there.""

"The UK has yet to finalise agreements to replace existing free trade deals the EU has with 40 big economies if there is a no-deal Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he ""hoped"" they would but it depended on whether other countries were ""willing to put the work in"". He said more deals were coming, after signing one with Australia. Concerns have been raised that the UK will leave the EU without a deal that would protect current arrangements. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, under the Article 50 process and the UK's EU Withdrawal Act, with or without a deal - unless the UK chooses to revoke Article 50 and continues as a member of the EU. MPs defeated the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by a huge margin earlier this week, which provided for a ""transition period"" of 21 months, under which much of the UK's relationship with the EU would remain the same. Reality Check: Has immigration held down wages? Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal' plan Farage seeking 'new party' for elections Top Germans plead with UK to stay in EU Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit In 2017, Mr Fox said that the UK could ""replicate the 40 free trade agreements before we leave the EU"", so that there would be no disruption to trade. But with just over two months to go until Brexit, not one has been signed, said the BBC's business correspondent Jonty Bloom. The Department for International Trade says some agreements are at an advanced stage but none of the 40 free trade deals that the EU has with other countries have so far been rolled over so that they will cover the UK after Brexit. The closest the UK has come to rolling over a free trade deal is an initial agreement with Switzerland to replicate the existing EU-Switzerland arrangements ""as far as possible"".  But that deal has not been formally signed yet. Asked abouta report in the Financial Times,externalthat Britain would not be close to finalising most of the 40 free trade deals the EU currently has with other countries, Mr Fox told the BBC: ""I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK. Our side is ready. ""It's largely dependent on other whether countries believe that there will be no deal and are willing to put the work in to the preparations."" On Friday, he signed a ""mutual recognition agreement"" with the Australian high commissioner in London - to maintain all current relevant aspects of the agreement it has with the EU. The EU does not have a free trade agreement with Australia. He said there would be a ""pipeline of them to be signed as we go through"" and the agreement made it easier for UK goods to comply with Australian standards. Mr Fox also said that staying in a permanent customs arrangement with the EU would ""not be delivering Brexit"" as he did not believe it would allow the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. Some opposition parties have been making the case for a customs union. Theresa May held talks with the leaders of parties including the SNP and the Lib Dems, about a way forward after she won a confidence vote by a narrow margin in the Commons on Wednesday. She also spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on the telephone on Thursday night, and will be speaking to more EU leaders over the weekend.

But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants the UK to be in a permanent customs union with ""strong"" ties to the single market, has refused to take part in talks with the prime minister until she rules out the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal. In a letter to Mrs May, Mr Corbyn said her talks were ""not genuine"". He also accused her of ""sticking rigidly"" to her withdrawal agreement. As many as 20 Tory ministers have also said they would quit the government unless the prime minister allows them to try to stop a no deal Brexit,according to the Telegraph,external. Mrs May says ruling out no deal is impossible as it is not within the government's power. Writingin the Financial Times,external, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservative Party was ""riven with division"" so Labour would ""return to Parliament to promote the compromise we believe is not only in the best interests of our economy but is also capable of securing sufficient support both here and in Brussels"". This video can not be played Johnson: 'Shameful' to extend Article 50 If Parliament was at an impasse, and Labour could not get a general election ""we should also retain the option of seeking a public vote,"" he added. Mr Corbyn has come under pressure from dozens of his MPs to back calls for another EU referendum. On Friday a pro-referendum campaign group paid for a wrap-around advertisement in his local newspaper, theIslington Tribune,external, urging him to back a ""public vote on Brexit"". In a speech at JCB Headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said changing the date of leaving from 29 March would be ""shameful"", and the public would view it as ""an elite conspiracy to thwart Brexit"". He instead urged the government to use Brexit to ""unite the country"".

"Margaret Wade and Marie Sweeney kept the child in their filthy flat The parents of a two-year-old girl who died of malnutrition have each been jailed for six years and four months. Lauren Wade was emaciated, dirty and riddled with head lice when she died in March 2015. Margaret Wade, 38, and Marie Sweeney, 37, had admitted the wilful ill-treatment and neglect of Lauren between June 2014 and March 2015. They also pled guilty last month to a similar charge in connection with two older children between 2007 and 2015. The judge, Lady Stacey, said the women had failed in their duties to the children. How toddler Lauren died of neglect She added: ""When your daughter died, your house was in a shocking state. The court heard Lauren Wade was ""emaciated"" for days before she died ""I don't think you need me to point out, but you had been offered advice, it was not taken."" The chairman of Glasgow's Child Protection Committee, Colin Anderson, called the case ""an appalling tragedy"". He said the cruelty and deceit of the women had helped them avoid what they perceived as interference from outside agencies. The High Court in Glasgow had heard that the couple, of Townhead, Glasgow, did not keep the children clean, provide proper food, clothes or medical care. Lauren was said to be ""plainly unwell"" and ""emaciated"" for days before she died. Wade insisted her ""pale and tired"" daughter had a cold. Margaret Wade and Marie Sweeney both considered themselves Lauren's mother On 20 March 2015, a 999 call was made after Lauren was found to be ""unresponsive"" at the family's flat in Sighthill, Glasgow. The child was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later. Lauren was described as ""skinny, dirty and unkempt"" at the time. She also had a sodden nappy, bald patches and ""thousands"" of head lice. Wade and Sweeney - a couple for 15 years - both regarded themselves as parents to Lauren. They moved to a flat in the city's Fountainwell Drive in 2011. A detective later branded the home ""one of the most disgusting"" he had seen in his career. Wade's QC Brian McConnachie said her mental health issues were ""partially responsible"" for the crimes. Lady Stacey went on to point out that advice in helping care for the children had been offered in 2007 then again in 2014, but was not taken. Mr McConnachie replied: ""She fully accepts that. Such was her internal difficulties, she did not find it easy to accept outside help. ""She deeply regrets that."" Sweeney's QC Ian Duguid said she had not been ""trying to hide"" what was a ""very sick or malnourished child"". He added: ""She accepts that she has let down the children badly - one with very catastrophic consequences.""

"The court has heard Alfie Lamb cried out ""mummy"" when a car seat was pushed back into him A three-year-old boy who was crushed by a car seat had trauma injuries similar to those of a victim in a car crash, a court has heard. Alfie Lamb died after his mother's boyfriend allegedly reversed his seat into him during a car journey in 2018. A paediatric pathologist told the Old Bailey the toddler's death was ""unnatural"" and appeared to have been caused by an ""increase in pressure."" Adrian Hoare, 23, and Stephen Waterson, 25, both deny manslaughter. Alfie was found unresponsive as the pair arrived at their home in Croydon following a shopping trip to Sutton with two others on 1 February. The court has heard the toddler had been in the back footwell during the journey and cried out ""mummy"" when Mr Waterson pushed back his seat. Dr Andreas Marnerides, who carried out a joint post mortem examination on Alfie's body, told the jury the three-year-old had been ""healthy"" and there was no ""natural explanation"" for his death. ""We had positive findings it was unnatural, it was trauma related,"" he said. Dr Marnerides said the toddler's injuries were similar to those seen in road traffic collisions and there was ""positive evidence"" they were caused by an ""increase in pressure in the body."" Lots of external petechial haemorrhages - tiny red spots caused by ruptured veins - were found on Alfie's head and body as well as inside his chest cavity, the court heard. Accused 'cried out' after boy's crush death Crush death boy 'told to shut up by mum' Boy, three, killed 'for being too noisy' Dr Marnerides said evidence of internal bleeding was explained by impact to the right side of the body. Jurors were also told Alfie's cause of death was given as ischemic brain injury caused by deprivation of blood or oxygen and compression asphyxia. Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of the car's driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and 19-year-old Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues.

"Cameron Cole won the final series of Big Brother Cameron Cole won people's hearts when he came out to his housemates on last year's final series of Big Brother UK. He went on to win the show but says he's experienced constant homophobia ever since. The 19-year-old says he receives abusive messages and phone calls on a daily basis. Cameron tells Radio 1 Newsbeat he's had face-to-face abuse too, with one incident happening at a bowling alley in Norfolk. He said: ""There were a couple of people sniggering and as I walked past, they said the homophobic remark beginning with the letter f.""

"The claim:Boris Johnson told a Channel 4 News reporter that he ""didn't say anything about Turkey during the referendum. Since I made no remarksâ¦I can't disown them"". Reality Check verdict:Boris Johnson talked about the issue of Turkey joining the EU several times in the lead-up to 23 June 2016 and was co-signatory of a letter to the prime minister warning about Turkish membership a week before the vote. The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised, after denying that he had ever said anything about possible Turkish membership of the EU during the referendum campaign in 2016. Taking questions after a speech on Brexit at the JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Johnson said: ""Since I made no remarks, I can't disown them."" He was responding to a reporter (from Channel 4 News) who accused him, along with Vote Leave, of suggesting that 80 million Turks would come to the UK if it stayed in the EU. In fact Mr Johnson did talk about Turkey on several occasions during the referendum campaign, often pointing out - correctly - that it was official government policy for Turkey to join the EU. A week before the Brexit vote he was also theco-signatory of a letter to the prime minister,external, which spoke of the ""rapidly accelerating pace"" of Turkey's accession negotiations. The letter said it was the policy of the EU for Turkey to join, and that if the UK government could not guarantee it would block this, ""the public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to vote Leave and take back control on 23 June"". Turkey's long-standing application for EU membership has actually been stuck in the slow lane for years, and it is no nearer joining the EU now than it was a decade ago. Mr Johnson, whose great-grandfather was Turkish, was a leading member of the Vote Leave campaign, which produced a poster with the slogan: ""Turkey, population 76 million, is joining the EU.

But, he said: ""It is the government's policy that Turkey should join the EU."" And on the Great Debate programme on Channel 4, where politicians went head-to-head on the subject of leaving the EU, he said: ""Last time I looked, the government wants to accelerate Turkish membership.

"'They are killing us': The murder last month of schoolteacher Laura Luelmo sparked protests at violence against women A man convicted of killing his wife is now believed to have murdered his defence lawyer, with whom he had been having an affair, before taking his own life on Friday. Jose Javier Salvador Calvo, 50, jumped from a bridge in the eastern town of Teruel when police confronted him. The case has shocked Spain, prompting debate about domestic violence laws. Reacting to the deaths, Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez vowed to continue tackling violence against women. His tweet is seen as a retort to Vox,a far-right party influential in the southern region of Andalusiathat wants to halt legal aid for women beaten by men, saying it unfairly favours the woman. Jose Javier Salvador Calvo shot dead his wife, Patricia Maurel Conte, 29, in May 2003 in Spain's north-eastern region of Aragon.

"Arif Ansari checked his reporter's script before it was broadcast, the court has heard BBC Asian Network's head of news has been found not guilty over the naming of a sexual abuse victim in a live radio broadcast. Arif Ansari checked and approved a reporter's script which named the woman, believing it was a pseudonym. Victims of sexual offences are given lifetime anonymity by law. After a two-day case Mr Ansari was found not guilty by a district judge at Sheffield Magistrates' Court, who said the broadcast was an ""honest mistake"". Mr Ansari was on trial accused of breaching the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992. He denied the charge. A BBC spokesman said: ""From the start we have accepted that mistakenly naming a victim of sexual abuse during a live broadcast last February was a serious mistake. ""The CPS had a choice to charge the BBC and/or the editor. We firmly believe that it should have been the BBC itself answering in court for this mistake, rather than the individual editor. ""We are relieved with the court's decision today."" The charge related to a live radio broadcast on 6 February last year. The journalist involved in the broadcast, Rickin Majithia, had gone to Sheffield Crown Court to hear evidence in a trial linked to the Rotherham sex abuse scandal when a victim's real name was used, the courtheard on the opening day of Mr Ansari's trial. Mr Majithia told the district judge, Naomi Redhouse, that he wrongly thought the name used was a pseudonym. His report, including the name which was described as a pseudonym, was broadcast as part of a live news bulletin and the woman - who was a victim of the Rotherham abuse - was listening to the radio when her name was read out. She said she went into ""full meltdown"", the court heard. The charge was brought against Mr Ansari, in his capacity as editor. Mr Ansari had the role of checking and approving the script before it was broadcast, the court heard. Giving evidence to a judge sitting at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Friday, Mr Ansari, 44, said he considered reporter Mr Majithia to be an excellent colleague who was very driven. ""I trusted his journalism,"" Mr Ansari said. ""He was a good journalist. ""This was not a complex legal issue. This is as basic as it gets. This is what journalists are taught at journalism school."" Mr Ansari added: ""It just struck me as 100% accurate. Rickin was a senior journalist, one of my senior reporters. ""He had a background, professional relationship with the victim in question. I didn't. I had never met her. I was in London. ""Furthermore, I knew that he knew that he could not name her, use her real name. Put all these factors together, it did not occur to me that this could be wrong. ""I trusted my reporter and the reason I sent him to Sheffield was to make sure he got it right."" Mr Ansari added that he regarded Mr Majithia as a ""loose cannon"" at times, but only because of a lack of co-ordination about what he was doing. After the live on-air news report was broadcast and named the victim on 6 February last year, Mr Ansari said Mr Majithia called him in a state of panic saying: ""I've got the name wrong, it wasn't a pseudonym, it was her real name."" Mr Ansari told the court the pair met in a pub in London later that evening, where Mr Ansari says he was shocked to realise that Mr Majithia had never reported from court before. ""I remember being somewhat shocked that he hadn't previously told me that,"" he told the court. Mr Ansari described Mr Majithia as ""very badly shaken"" and ""in a really bad way"" when he returned to London. Previously on Thursday - the first day of the trial - the court heard a witness statement from the woman who said she was ""panicking and crying"". She said she had found the process of giving evidence in the sex abuse trial at Sheffield Crown Court difficult and added: ""To then have my name given out as a victim of rape on a BBC radio station was unbelievable and made me feel sick"". The court also heard how Mr Majithia had sent Mr Ansari his script for approval at about 16:35 GMT, and it was broadcast live at 17:00. Mr Majithia explained to the court how the woman gave evidence in court from behind a screen and he wrongly assumed that when her forename was used in court it was a pseudonym. The reporter said that he had a number of previous dealings with the woman as he investigated the Rotherham abuse scandal and had become confused, thinking that the name he had always called her was her real one, when it was not. The prosecution had said it accepted Mr Ansari did not know or suspect the victim's real name was in the script but said he had good reason to suspect the name that was used might be wrong because Mr Majithia was inexperienced. Mr Ansari was charged with - and then cleared of - breaching theSexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,external, which entitles all complainants of sexual offences to lifelong anonymity. From the moment a complaint of sexual abuse is made, all publishers and broadcasters are banned from naming the complainant unless they choose to waive their anonymity or a court orders otherwise. It is the first time a BBC editor had been charged under this Act.

"Mac the Moose stares down Norway's Storelgen Since 1984, residents of Moose Jaw have had one big thing about which they could boast: Mac the Moose. The Canadian city was long the proud owner of the world's tallest moose statue, a 9.75m (32-foot) steel-framed creature, covered with metal mesh and cement. But a few years ago, a slightly taller moose statue was erected in Norway, beating Mac's record by some 30cm. Now, Moose Jaw has launched a campaign to reclaim the crown. ""We're considered to be very mannerly and respectful, but there are things you just don't do to Canadians,"" Fraser Tolmie, mayor of the prairie town, told the BBC. ""You don't mess with Mac the Moose."" Norway's Storelgen, or ""Big Moose"", stands on a highway partway between Norway's capital of Oslo and the city of Trondheim. It was built in 2015 by artist Linda Bakke in partnership with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration in an effort to reduce traffic accidents. According to an article that appeared in the Daily Scandinavian,external, Ms Bakke felt it was ""important that the elk was made higher than Mac the Moose"". Moose Jaw Mayor Fraser Tolmie says 'don't mess with Mac' Mr Tolmie was recently alerted to the loss of the crown bySaskatchewan YouTubers Justin and Greg,external, who posted a video in January urging the city to add 31cm to Mac or to rename the city simply ""Jaw"". The mayor said the city has since fielded a number of suggestions from residents on how to add to Mac's height. ""There's even been a suggestion about stilettos,"" he said, but noted the most popular suggestion so far has been to ""give Mac a bigger rack"" of antlers. England's allegiances and rivalries India unveils world's tallest statue The city's tourism department claims Mac remains one of the most photographed roadside attractions in Canada. A Facebook poll by Norwegian online newspaper Dagbladet, posted on Thursday, has Canada's Mac in the lead as the favourite moose statue among 60% of more than 20,000 online voters.

"This video can not be played Trump's attorney general nominee William Barr is quizzed about obstruction US President Donald Trump has hit back over a news report that he directed his then personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News said Mr Trump had instructed Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was convicted over the case last month. Mr Trump said the lawyer was lying about the Moscow project to ""reduce his jail time"". The office of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller also disputed the report. A spokesman for Mr Mueller - who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump campaign figures were complicit - said Buzzfeed's ""description of specific statements"" and ""characterisation of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate"". Democratic politicians say they will investigate Buzzfeed's allegations. Buzzfeed says its report is based on testimony from two unnamed law enforcement officials,externalinvestigating the matter. The story alleges Mr Trump received 10 personal updates from Cohen about a plan to build the Moscow tower at a time when Mr Trump denied having any business ties to Russia. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was All you need to know about Trump Russia story Seven legal headaches for the president Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son, Donald Jnr, were also updated, the story alleges. Mr Mueller has already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Cohen told Congress talks over the plan had taken place between September 2015 and January 2016 but criminal complaint documents say they lasted until June. Cohen said the plan had been halted earlier in an attempt to ""minimise links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1"" during the election campaign. Individual 1 has previously been identified by Cohen as Mr Trump. Buzzfeed says Cohen has told investigators that Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" about the date negotiations ended ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"" The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The report said Mr Mueller had other evidence, including from interviews with other Trump organisation staff and internal company emails, to corroborate Cohen's version of events. The report also says Mr Trump allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News With the longest government shutdown in history poised to stretch into a fifth week, Washington has become a political powder keg. The report on Thursday night that there is documentary evidence Donald Trump directed his former attorney to lie to Congress just lit a big fuse. If the Buzzfeed story is substantiated - and it asserts this evidence is already in the hands of Mr Mueller - this would appear to present a strong case for presidential obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a hearing on Tuesday, prompted attorney general nominee William Barr to acknowledge as much. Already the quiet whispers of impeachment among House Democrats are getting louder. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been able to tamp down this sentiment so far, but she may be unable - or unwilling - to keep it under wraps much longer. For almost two years, Mr Mueller's Russia investigation has been a cipher, with details of its activities coming only in opaque legal filings and anonymous accounts of unascertainable veracity. It seems the time for him to put his cards on the table and end the speculation and parlour-game guessing is rapidly approaching. In fact it's past time, if you ask some Democrats. The intelligence committee of the House of Representatives will investigate the claims, says its new chairman, Adam Schiff.He said the allegations against Mr Trump,externalwere ""among the most serious to date"". The head of the House judiciary committee, Jerrold Nadler, said it would also work to ""get to the bottom"" of the case. Some Democrats reacted by calling for impeachment. This video can not be played How the jailing of Cohen affects Trump Representative Ted Lieu tweeted,externalthat the story established a ""clear case of Obstruction of Justice, a felony"". Representative for Texas Joaquin Castro,externalsaid that if the story were true ""President Trump must resign or be impeached"". The president's response on Twitter,externalmainly retweeted a Fox News reporter's comment that Cohen had been ""convicted of perjury and fraud"", though the president added ""Lying to reduce his jail time!"" The president's current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, issued a statement on Friday saying that ""any suggestion from any source that the president counselled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false"". Earlier, Mr Giuliani told the Washington Post,external: ""If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge."" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News it was ""ludicrous"" to give credibility to Buzzfeed, saying its ""uncorroborated"" story was the kind of fake news the president and his team had to deal with daily. He said that Cohen had been ""proven to be a liar"". Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. It is up to the attorney general to notify Congress and decide whether the report will be released publicly. Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? President Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is currently undergoing confirmation in Congress. He has said he will make as much of the Mueller report public as possible but has not promised to publish it all. Cohen was sentenced in New York last month So far Mr Mueller's investigation has led to charges against more than two dozen Russians, as well as several people connected to Mr Trump himself, including his former national security adviser and the former chairman of his election campaign. A number of them, including Cohen, are known to be co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. How could the president be impeached? How will history judge President Trump? Cohen's help to Russia probe revealed Cohen must report to prison by 6 March, but before that, he has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in February.

"The Singapore summit was the first such meeting for a sitting US president US President Donald Trump is to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for a second summit by the end of February, the White House says. The announcement came after Mr Trump met top North Korean negotiator Kim Yong-chol at the White House. He had been expected to deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un to Mr Trump. Little progress has been made on denuclearisation since their historic summit in Singapore last June. No venue has been announced for the new summit. Speculation is mounting that it could be held in Vietnam. North Korea's breakdown of communication Handshake moment explained in pictures Kim Yong-chol's visit to Washington is the first sign of movement in nuclear diplomacy with North Korea for months, BBC state department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher reports.

It is not clear what the reported letter from Kim Jong-un contained. But it was expected to lay the groundwork for another summit, our correspondent adds. President Trump said he was looking forward to the talks. His press secretary Sarah Sanders said after the White House meeting that progress in the talks on denuclearisation continued, but added: ""The United States is going to continue to keep pressure and sanctions on North Korea."" Not very much was agreed on in the Singapore summit, so there is little to measure success by. This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled, no detailed account of North Korea's nuclear facilities has been provided and sanctions are still firmly in place. Mr Kim however, has been busy boosting his global image. He's improved relations with neighbouring South Korea, and both countries have destroyed guard posts along the heavily guarded demilitarised zone - and paid trips to each other's countries. Ties between North Korea and China also appear to have improved, with Mr Kim making multiple trips to Beijing to meet President Xi. The summit was historic for the fact that it happened at all - but on paper, all it really achieved was a vaguely-phrased agreement in which both countries agreed to work towards denuclearisation. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? It was never really made clear what denuclearisation would entail - the agreement did not include any timeline, details or mechanisms to verify this process. Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments Watch: Inside train used by Kim on China visit If there is a second summit, many will be expecting something more concrete to come out of it. Both North Korea and the US are unlikely to get away with calling another vague agreement a success. North Korea hasn't conducted a missile test since the summit. It's also dismantled a nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. It did however test out a new ""high-tech"" tactical weapon last November - its first official report of a weapons test in a year. This however, was not taken to represent a huge threat. Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? But it's still not clear how many nuclear facilities still exist in North Korea. A report after last year's summit identified the extent of North Korea's network of missile bases. This video can not be played How is North Korea evading sanctions? However, this is not a breach of the Singapore agreement - as North Korea has not made any commitment to halt any weapons development or shut down its missile bases. It should. Both sides appear to want it to happen. The last summit was a rollercoaster in itself - it was cancelled, and then restarted after a hand-delivered letter to Mr Trump from Mr Kim. It's not impossible that something similar might happen again - we'll just have to wait and see. This time, however, a letter appears to have arrived early enough.

A report from Buzzfeed News claims President Donald Trump directed his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen to mislead Congress about plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow. So what is this Moscow tower - and how did it come to the forefront of discussions around Mr Trump and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing inquiry into alleged Russian meddling? No, but not for a lack of trying. Mr Trump has discussed wanting a tower in the city for the last 30 years. He envisioned ""a large luxury hotel across the street from the Kremlin in partnership with the Soviet government"" in his 1987 book Art of the Deal. Donald Trump and his then wife Ivana visit St Petersburg in July, 1987 Mr Trump called Russia ""one of the hottest places in the world for investment"" in a 2007 deposition,the Washington Post reported,external. ""We will be in Moscow at some point,"" he had added. In 2013,following an eventful trip to Moscowfor his Miss Universe Pageant, Mr Trump reiterated these plans, tweeting: ""TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next."" The tower came up again in 2015 discussions between Trump Organization aides, led by Cohen, and Russian contacts. But so far, all of the plans have fizzled out. Cohen, Mr Trump's right hand man turned Mueller informant, first began meeting with Russian-born businessman Felix Sater in 2015. The soon-to-be candidate Trump had Cohen spearhead renewed efforts towards a 100-storey Trump Tower Moscow. According to a BuzzFeed report in November 2018,the Trump Organization planned to offer Russian President Vladimir Putinthe $50m penthouse at the top, a claim that the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called ""pure garbage"". The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen seen at Trump Tower, December 12, 2016 Cohen fell afoul of the special counsel for lying to Congress at least three times about the timeline and extent of these plans. He initially said the project dissolved in January 2016, that he ""never considered"" asking Mr Trump to visit Moscow for the project, ""never agreed"" to do so himself, and that he did not recall any Russian government response. Cohen then admitted in a plea deal with Mr Mueller that he lied ""to be consistent with"" and ""loyal"" to Mr Trump and had indeed kept the Trump family appraised of the developments. Now, it has become clear that negotiations over the tower continued through June 2016 - at which point Mr Trump was already the Republican presidential nominee. Mr Trump has insisted he had no investments in Russia and the Moscow project was just one of the venues his organisation was pursuing during his presidential bid. ""There was a good chance I wouldn't have won,"" Mr Trump has told reporters. ""And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"" But Thursday's report claims Mr Trump received 10 personal updates from Cohen about the plans during a time when Mr Trump denied having any business ties to Russia. Mr Trump ""personally instructed"" Cohen to lie in order to ""obscure Trump's involvement"",according to Buzzfeed, and Mr Mueller reportedly has substantial evidence of this. President Trump and President Putin shake hands during their July 2018 summit There is no law barring a presidential candidate from exploring foreign business deals, though it is a rare situation. It is, however, a federal crime for a president to direct a witness to lie to Congress. This week, Mr Trump's pick for attorney general William Barr confirmed during his hearings he certainly believes a president can be guilty of obstructing justice for doing so. So if the claim that Mr Trump instructed Cohen to lie was found to be true, legal analysts say this would amount to obstruction of justice, and it would stoke calls for impeachment among the president's critics. Another issue the Moscow project raises is whether Mr Trump's longstanding desire for the property has coloured his pro-Russia views. If Mr Trump received updates about Cohen's dealings with top Kremlin officials in a project that Mr Mueller's team says could have made him ""hundreds of millions of dollars"", the president's calls for camaraderie with Russia may have served his personal interest instead of a patriotic one.

"General Kim Yong-chol is a controversial but key figure in North Korean diplomacy North Korean general Kim Yong-chol is reportedly heading to Washington DC via Beijing as part of preparations for a second summit between North Korea and the United States. The General's trip to the US continues a series of remarkable developments after a year of surprises surrounding Korean diplomacy in 2018. He is often referred to as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un's right-hand man and is notionally forbidden to travel to the US, having been twice sanctioned by Washington. But he has been at his leader's side at key summit meetings in 2018 and 2019, and his second visit to America this week highlights his importance to Pyongyang's diplomatic efforts. During his time as North Korea's military intelligence chief, Gen Kim was accused of masterminding attacks on the South Korean warship Cheonan and on Yeonpyeong Island in 2010. He is also linked to the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and led the country's delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony in South Korea's Pyeongchang. General Kim is his Supreme Leader's right hand man at the Inter-Korean Summit in April General Kim Yong-chol emerged as a key player in North Korean diplomacy in 2018. Despite having the same surname, he is not related to the country's Supreme Leader. He was at Kim Jong-un's side in all of his high-profile summits since 2018, including the June summit with Trump in Singapore and the North Korean leader's latest visit to Beijing in January 2019. He was also a member of the welcoming party for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visits to Pyongyang in May and October 2018, and met Mr Pompeo and Mr Trump when he visited the United States in June before the first North Korea-US summit. Amid stalled talks on denuclearisation, another meeting between Kim Yong-chol and Mr Pompeo was planned in New York for November, but was cancelled abruptly. The former spy chief's current official position is vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, but he rose to prominence as Pyongyang's chief military negotiator during inter-Korean talks between 2006 and 2008. He later served as the director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau, tasked with cyber-warfare and gathering foreign intelligence, from 2009 to 2016. In 2016, he took charge of the United Front Department, the civilian intelligence agency which supposedly operates pro-North Korean groups in South Korea and handles inter-Korean affairs. Soon after this appointment, however, he was reportedly sent for ""ideological re-education"" as punishment for an ""overbearing attitude"", according to South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo. He retained his posts despite the punishment, and his rise to prominence in 2018 shows he is now clearly very much in favour and a valued adviser to Kim Jong-un. Kim Yong-chol celebrates the performance of a South Korean art troupe in Pyongyang Gen Kim's re-emergence in 2018 was initially met with hostility in South Korea, where he's accused of being a key figure in the 2010 sinking of the South Korean naval corvette Cheonan. North Korea vehemently denies any involvement in the torpedoing of the ship, in which 46 sailors died. The Cheonan naval corvette was sunk by a torpedo He was also reported to be involved in the 2014 Sony hack in response to the comedy film The Interview, which mocked Kim Jong-un. Gen Kim's alleged role in past events led to protests from conservative forces in South Korea before the 2018 Winter Olympics when it emerged that he would visit. ""We absolutely oppose a visit to the South by Kim Yong-chol, the main culprit of the Cheonan's sinking,"" said Kim Sung-tae, then floor leader of the opposition Liberty Korea Party. The party's statement also said that Kim Yong-chol deserved ""death by beating"" and called on the government to block the visit. Kim Yong-chol led North Korea's delegation to the Winter Olympic closing ceremony However, South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon stated that in the name of the relaxing of tensions between the two Koreas, there would be no restrictions on his travel for the Olympics. He has since stood on South Korean soil for a second time, crossing the border with Kim Jong-un as part of the inter-Korean summit delegation in April 2018.

"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

"Donald Trump arrived in Singapore promising to make history. That he did by shaking Kim Jong-un's hand for the world's cameras - becoming the first sitting US leader to meet his North Korean counterpart. But what have they really achieved, what are the implications and what might happen next? We asked four experts for their take. Andrea Berger, senior research associate, James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies Kim Jong-un departed Singapore without putting his signature next to any more detailed or ambitious nuclear-related provisions. The language in the Singapore declaration mirrors previous agreements, and is in places even more vague. In that sense, the joint document is a present that has been elaborately wrapped and re-gifted. But it may be the thought that counts. The meeting in Singapore has created political space for, and momentum towards, further direct talks, which are more appropriate for filling in details absent from the joint agreement. In fact, Mr Trump's press conference indicates that additional verbal commitments may already have been made. Among other revelations, he announced plans to cancel US-South Korean joint military exercises. North Korea has long had an allergy to these drills, and Mr Trump agreed they were ""provocative"". Parts of the US defence community will undoubtedly object to the cancellation of legitimate, defensive exercises, not least because it is unclear whether the decision was taken in concert with allies in South Korea. Yet suspending joint exercises could help enable further progress with Pyongyang, as it did when the ""Team Spirit"" drills were called off in the early 1990s. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? John Nilsson-Wright,North-east Asia expert, Chatham House and senior lecturer, University of Cambridge For the two leaders, the feeling must surely be that the summit has met all their expectations and can count as a success. But we should be careful to distinguish between the visuals and the ambitious expectations on the one hand and the need to deliver real, measurable and unambiguous progress on the other. This feels more like the triumph of faith over reality with a heavy dose of spin and salesmanship thrown in to bolster Donald Trump's standing with his base at home. Mr Kim will have been pleased by his burnished image as a responsible international statesman whom the US president likes and respects. The North Korean leader will also surely be encouraged by Mr Trump's surprise announcement that US-South Korea joint military exercises will be ending. Looking ahead, the US will need to keep the momentum behind the discussions and begin rapidly to deliver meaningful progress. Handshake moment explained in pictures Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments Regionally, US allies will be unsettled by the president's remarks apparently hinting at the possible drawdown of US forces in the region at some point and a repeat of familiar defence burden-sharing arguments. Even if not explicitly tied to the summit, this reference - along with the announced suspension of the joint military exercises - risks destabilising critically important alliance ties, possibly sparking in turn a further disruptive expansion in regional military competition and a zero-sum arms race. It's hard to see how the latest communique concretely and meaningfully addresses the humanitarian concerns of Japan over abductions carried out by North Korea. China too will want to see evidence that North Korea is adopting a more accommodating posture, but will take heart from the signs that Mr Trump's position is less combative and that, for now, the prospect of military action has well and truly receded. Ankit Panda, adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and a senior editor at the Diplomat The joint declaration makes two separate references to ""complete denuclearisation"". That is a loaded phrase and not exactly what it seems. But the last thing ""complete denuclearisation"" means is that North Korea will unilaterally disarm itself - or completely, verifiably, and irreversibly dismantle its nuclear weapons. The latter phrase, often abbreviated to ""CVID"", was nowhere to be found in the declaration and that's far from a surprise. In the lead-up to the summit, North Korea made clear that Kim Jong-un was not coming to Singapore to turn over the keys to his nuclear programme. ""Complete denuclearisation"" - a formulation that first appeared in the 27 April Panmunjom declaration between the two Koreas - is ambiguous, open-ended and, in its most generous interpretation, refers to global nuclear disarmament. This video can not be played Kim: ""The world will see a major change"" The headline-winning concessions that the country has made to date on its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, including the announcement of a moratorium on intercontinental-range ballistic missile testing and the presumably reversible dismantlement of its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, were announced in late April and had little to do with ongoing diplomacy with South Korea and the US. Full text of the signed statement Trump-Kim summit explained Diplomacy on a plate: What did they eat? In North Korea's framing, these were actions that were taken because the country had completed its nuclear deterrent and now wanted to signal to the world that it would continue to exist as a mature and responsible nuclear weapons power. Mr Trump appears to have extracted a lone, technical concession from North Korea at the summit. After signing the Singapore declaration, he asked Mr Kim to dismantle a ""missile engine testing site"". The North Korean reportedly accepted the request - even if this was not put in writing. This site appears to be distinct from a recently razed site near Kusong associated with the country's development of advanced road-mobile missile launchers. This video can not be played Trump: ""The past does not have to define our future"" We lack enough detail to know what site Mr Trump meant specifically, but there's a chance that he was referring to North Korea's solid propellant engine test site at Hamhung. Even with North Korea's considerable progress in ballistic missiles, solid propellant missiles are the next frontier for its programmes. If Mr Trump managed to secure an assurance from North Korea on this point, we may see it emerge as an important point of technical discussion in a subsequent round of US-North Korea talks. Sokeel Park, director of research and strategy, Liberty in North Korea A massively hyped, unprecedented summit that produced a very light, boilerplate agreement. The terms really could have been copy and pasted from other agreements with North Korea. So an unimpressive start, but this was always only going to be the starting gun for a marathon process that we will have to wait a year or two to judge. Even if a 100% solution on denuclearisation remains elusive, there is hope that this time an engagement process could stick because Kim Jong-un, only 34 years old, has to play a long game lasting decades, and knows that he needs economic growth to maintain power for the long term. This video can not be played North Koreans answer 'stupid questions' The more we can open the country and accelerate the people's demands for a growing economy and better lives, the more Kim Jong-un will have to secure a favourable environment for trade and investment from China, South Korea and the rest of the world, and the more he will be tied to a track of positive engagement. So in the deals that we make and the approach we take with North Korea, we have to make sure that it's a win not just for Kim Jong-un but also for the North Korean people. That is the only way to put us on a track of long-term sustainable progress. My sense is that a lot of ordinary and richer North Koreans alike will welcome this re-engagement with China and South Korea and new high-level engagement with the US. People tend to want change, breakthroughs and better economic opportunities.  However, outside of controlled reporting in state media most North Koreans of course don't have nearly as much information, analysis and commentary about all this, so even though they are affected more they may actually be thinking about it less.

"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

Aram Kurd, Hawkar Hassan and Arkan Ali caused the explosion in Hinckley Road, Leicester, on 25 February, destroying a supermarket and a flat above. Leicester Crown Court was told they set alight large amounts of petrol in the basement of the Polish store. A mother and her two sons were among those killed in the ""bomb-like"" blast.

"The claim:Boris Johnson told a Channel 4 News reporter that he ""didn't say anything about Turkey during the referendum. Since I made no remarksâ¦I can't disown them"". Reality Check verdict:Boris Johnson talked about the issue of Turkey joining the EU several times in the lead-up to 23 June 2016 and was co-signatory of a letter to the prime minister warning about Turkish membership a week before the vote. The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has been criticised, after denying that he had ever said anything about possible Turkish membership of the EU during the referendum campaign in 2016. Taking questions after a speech on Brexit at the JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Johnson said: ""Since I made no remarks, I can't disown them."" He was responding to a reporter (from Channel 4 News) who accused him, along with Vote Leave, of suggesting that 80 million Turks would come to the UK if it stayed in the EU. In fact Mr Johnson did talk about Turkey on several occasions during the referendum campaign, often pointing out - correctly - that it was official government policy for Turkey to join the EU. A week before the Brexit vote he was also theco-signatory of a letter to the prime minister,external, which spoke of the ""rapidly accelerating pace"" of Turkey's accession negotiations. The letter said it was the policy of the EU for Turkey to join, and that if the UK government could not guarantee it would block this, ""the public will draw the reasonable conclusion that the only way to avoid having common borders with Turkey is to vote Leave and take back control on 23 June"". Turkey's long-standing application for EU membership has actually been stuck in the slow lane for years, and it is no nearer joining the EU now than it was a decade ago. Mr Johnson, whose great-grandfather was Turkish, was a leading member of the Vote Leave campaign, which produced a poster with the slogan: ""Turkey, population 76 million, is joining the EU. Vote Leave - Take Back Control."" It was the suggestion that Turkish accession could be imminent, and that millions of Turks could soon travel to the UK, which caused controversy.

Asked at the time about the poster, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson said, ""Frankly I don't mind whether Turkey joins the EU, provided the UK leaves the EU."" But, he said: ""It is the government's policy that Turkey should join the EU."" And on the Great Debate programme on Channel 4, where politicians went head-to-head on the subject of leaving the EU, he said: ""Last time I looked, the government wants to accelerate Turkish membership. ""I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask people whether they would rather proceed on the basis of government promises of immigration or whether they would rather take back control and implement (a) points-based system."" After the denial by the former foreign secretary, the Labour MP Chuka Umunna said it was ""yet another lie"" over which Mr Johnson had been ""caught out"". Mr Johnson's spokesman declined to comment.

"Hundreds of thousands of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers were unable to make payments from their online accounts today. Some have been facing the frustration of not being able to pay and transfer money online. Others were not able to confirm whether funds were arriving in their account. A spokesperson for Lloyds Banking Group, which owns the three brands, apologised but said its systems were now back up and running. ""However due to the issues experienced today there may be a delay in processing some of the payments that customers made earlier in the day. We continue to advise customers that they should not submit a second payment, to avoid duplicate payments being processed."" The bank said no customers would be out of pocket as a result of the IT issue. Steve Davis, a quality engineer from Leicester said he was caught out by the problems this morning, when he was notified that a client's money had been transferred, but it failed to appear in his Halifax bank account. ""I got a notification of a transfer going in from the [banking] app... by 11 o'clock it hadn't appeared. Then by midday it still hadn't appeared"". Mr Davis said it wasn't until he called his bank that somebody told him of the IT failure, which he was told would be ""fixed by 3pm"". ""What was most infuriating was that nobody told us anything...[they] just leave us in the dark"".

"Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and Jens Lehmann are among the letter's signatories Leading German figures have written to the UK asking it to stay in the EU. The letter,published in the Times,external, is signed by 31 people, including the leader of the Christian Democratic Union - and likely successor to Angela Merkel - Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and former Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. They cited post-work pints and pantomime as beloved British habits. But the UK's role in post-war Europe is the focus of the signatories calling for Britain to stay.

""After the horrors of the Second World War, Britain did not give up on us,"" it continued. ""It has welcomed Germany back as a sovereign nation and a European power. ""This we, as Germans, have not forgotten and we are grateful."" The signatories said that they ""respect the choice"" of British people who want to leave the EU and, if the country wants to leave for good, ""it will always have friends in Germany and Europe"".

"Players can form squads to help them survive in Fortnite A 41-year-old man accused of using the hit video game Fortnite to initiate sexual activity with children has been arrested in Florida. Anthony Gene Thomas of Broward County is accused of unlawful sex with a minor and possessing indecent images and videos of at least one victim. According to police, an accomplice used Fortnite's voice chat to meet children and introduce them to Mr Thomas. Police believe there could be up to 20 additional victims. ""This case is disturbing not only because it involves child pornography, but also because a popular online game was used to communicate with the victim,"" saidFlorida attorney general Ashley Moody,externalin a statement. ""Parents need to know that predators will use any means possible to target and exploit a child. I am asking parents and guardians to please make sure you know who your children meet online, and talk to them about sexual predators."" Ms Moody has urged any othervictims to get in touch with the police,external. Mr Thomas allegedly groomed the 17-year-old victim using cash and gifts, one of which was a mobile phone which allowed him to contact the child. This led to a face-to-face meeting in late August 2018, after which Mr Thomas and his collaborator drove the minor to Mr Thomas's home, where the sexual offences were committed. The parents reported the child missing and police later located and returned the teenager home. The victim remained in contact with Mr Thomas, claims the Florida attorney general, which led police to search Mr Thomas's home and seize his phone. Analysis of the device revealed pornographic pictures and videos of the victim. Fortnite's Battle Royale mode is an online multiplayer game in which 100 players fight for survival, with the winner being the last person standing. Players can also team up with friends or strangers and work together. As in many other online games, players who have joined a squad can talk to one another using unmoderated voice chat. However, the voice chat can also be disabled in the settings menu. In May last year, the NSPCC issueda warning about the chat systems in Fortnite,saying they left children open to being contacted by strangers. It advised parents to turn off the game's voice chat system but warned that the text messaging feature could not be disabled.

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

"This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham A pilot was ""doing nothing"" to avoid crashing his jet at the Shoreham Airshow killing 11 men, a court heard. Witness Derek Davis said it was obvious something was wrong with Andy Hill's flight, with another witness saying the pilot had made a ""gross error... thousands of feet too low"". Mr Hill, 54, is on trial after his Hawker Hunter crashed on the A27 erupting into a ""massive fireball"". He denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, in August 2015. The court heard the aircraft erupted in a ""massive fireball"" when it hit the ground Mr Davis, a former RAF flight instructor and chairman of the air show's flying control committee, told the court he only realised something was wrong when the plane began to descend as part of a bent-loop manoeuvre. The move had earlier been described as ""perhaps the highest risk manoeuvre in an aircraft which is not designed as a pure aerobatic aircraft"", such as a Hawker Hunter. Mr Davis said the way in which the plane was ""waffling down"" towards the ground indicated ""there is something wrong with either the aircraft or the pilot"". ""He was not desperately trying to miss the ground or anything. He was doing nothing,"" Mr Davis told the jury. ""I thought the aircraft on the descent was not being controlled,"" Mr Davis said. Asked what led to his concern, he said: ""He did not apply power which would have been needed. ""There was no noise. The pilot did not make any radio transmission that he had a problem. ""If he thought something was wrong he could tell somebody,"" he said. ""It didn't jettison the canopy. He didn't explode the hood off or anything."" He said it appeared to him as though Mr Hill was able to pull back on the plane's ""stick"" and attempt to avoid a crash. Asked why he did not call a stop to the display at that point, Mr Davis replied:  ""The situation when you see an aircraft in trouble or doing something extremely unusual it could well be that there is something wrong inside that aircraft."" ""It could well be that the pilot is working extremely hard to rectify that."" He said a call to the pilot could ""interfere"" with his attempts to deal with a fault. RAF squadron leader Daniel Arlett told the court that as Mr Hill made the fateful manoeuvre he was ""thousands of feet"" too low and had made ""a massive gross error"". Mr Arlett, who led a team of display pilots at the time and assessed Mr Hill before he joined the squad, described the defendant as an ""expert pilot"". He said he first had concerns when he realised the Hawker Hunter was suddenly unusually quiet. He said that as Mr Hill began the final manoeuvre he realised the plane was ""too low for a looping manoeuvre recovery"". ""We are talking thousands of feet low. This is a massive, gross error."" He said the jet had appeared to ""flop"" over at the top of the loop. ""It felt like it was just the gravity pushing it down,"" he told the jury. ""As soon as I knew the nose was pointing down there was only one ending going to happen."" The Hawker Hunter jet plummeted on to the A27 on 22 August 2015 Thomas Moloney, an experienced display pilot who once owned the crashed aircraft but had never flown it, witnessed the manoeuvre. He told the court he had experienced a ""sickening feeling"" when he saw the plane pull upwards, because ""the pilot has not attained sufficient speeds to pull into vertical"". ""When the aircraft went vertical I sort of felt that it was not going to end very well,"" he told the jury. ""I said to the pilot standing next to me, a friend of mine, 'God he's slow'. ""As the nose dropped the crash was inevitable."" Shoreham jury shown footage of crash Shoreham crash pilot 'known risk-taker' One of the first medics on the scene, Red Cross nurse Tony Kemp, said he found Mr Hill lying on the ground, with his helmet removed. He described the pilot as ""semi-conscious and able to respond"". ""He had quite a lot of blood around his face, coming from a head wound,"" the court heard. He said he was ""responsive and somewhat combative"", and ""having difficulty understanding all that we were saying"". Andy Hill had ""responded professionally"" to errors made at previous air shows, the court heard Mr Hill attempted to push away an oxygen mask but this was ""purely down to his [medical] condition"", Mr Kemp said. ""Mr Hill suddenly crashed very seriously. He was about to have a cardiac arrest."" The nurse inserted a needle into Mr Hill's chest to relieve a build up of air, from a ""life-threatening puncture to his lung"", the court heard.

"This video can not be played Witness Roy Warne: ""There was a huge collision"" The man who helped free the Duke of Edinburgh from his Land Rover after his crash has described how he saw the vehicle ""careering"" across the road. Prince Philip, 97, was unhurt but visited hospital on Friday for a check-up following Thursday's crash. A nine-month-old boy in the other car was uninjured. The driver, a 28-year-old woman, had cuts while a 45-year-old female passenger broke her wrist. Witness Roy Warne said the duke asked about their welfare after the crash. A Palace spokesperson said the duke's hospital visit confirmed he had ""no injuries of concern"". Mr Warne was driving home when he saw the car roll and end up on the other side of the road. He said the duke was ""obviously shaken"" but managed to stand up and ask how the others involved in the crash were, he said. Mr Warne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I saw it careering, tumbling across the road and ending up on the other side. ""It would take a massive force [to have done that]."" Duke crash 'puts spotlight on road safety' Is age a factor behind the wheel? This video can not be played Prince Philip crash: Roy Warne describes aftermath He said that after seeing the crash, on the A149 near Sandringham: ""I went to the other car. There was a baby in the back and, with another man, we got the baby out. ""Then I went to the black car to help and realised it was the Duke of Edinburgh."" Mr Warne said he overheard the duke telling police he had been ""dazzled by the sun"". The two people who were first to the scene of the crash say the duke appears to have been travelling alone in the vehicle at the moment of collision. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have been staying at the Norfolk estate since Christmas Damage to the Land Rover's left side could be seen after the crash The two women in the Kia were taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn to be treated for the broken wrist and cuts to the knee, and were later discharged. A Palace spokesman said contact had been made with the occupants of the Kia - the other car involved in the crash - to exchange ""well-wishes"". Norfolk Police said it was standard policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. The incident will be investigated ""and any appropriate action taken"", the force added. Chris Spinks, who led Norfolk's roads policing team for five years, said officers would likely follow-up on first hand accounts and interview those involved. The retired chief inspector added that there would be ""no favouritism"" shown towards the duke during the investigation. By BBC Reality Check In November 2018, there were 5.3 million over-70s with full driving licences in Britain, according to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. There were 11,245 people involved in road traffic accidents where the driver was in that age group - a rate of two per 1,000 licence holders. For Britain's 2.8 million drivers aged 17 to 24, the rate was more than four times as high, at nine per 1,000. The DVLA did not provide figures on whether this simply reflected that the older age group were on the road less than the younger age group. However, a separate study from the National Travel Survey suggests that over-70 drive an average of 1,000 miles a year more than under-20s. Asked if Prince Philip was trapped, Mr Warne replied: ""Yes, he was. I asked him to move his left leg and that freed his right leg and then I helped him get out."" He said he couldn't remember what the duke had then said, but added that ""it was nothing rude"". ""He was obviously shaken, and then he went and asked if everyone else was all right,"" said Mr Warne. Debris at the scene where Prince Philip was involved in a traffic accident Asked if the duke had then thanked him for getting him out of the car, Mr Warne said: ""No, but he wasn't being discourteous. He had other things on his mind, I'm sure."" Mr Warne said there was ""a little bit of blood"" and that a member of what he described as the royal entourage gave him a wipe for his hands, adding ""a lot of people arrived very quickly"". Prince Philip, seen driving here in May 2018, was not taken to hospital He said the two women involved were ""very shaken"", adding: ""One of them was the mother of the child and she was quite upset."" Norfolk County Council was already due to discuss safety issues on the road - described as a ""rat run"" by one local - before the crash took place. On Friday, it approved plans for new safety measures on that section of the A149. The speed limit will be lowered from 60mph to 50mph and an average speed monitoring system will be implemented. Prime Minister Theresa May sent the duke a message wishing him well following the crash.

"This video can not be played Witness Roy Warne: ""There was a huge collision"" A crash involving the Duke of Edinburgh on a notorious A-road has highlighted road safety, a meeting has heard. Prince Philip, 97, escaped unhurt after his Land Rover overturned near the Queen's Sandringham estate on Thursday. It happened a day before Norfolk councillors agreed to cut the speed limit on the A149, where there have been five deaths in six years. Councillor Colleen Walker said the duke's involvement had brought the issue ""right to the forefront"". The Labour councillor told the county's transport committee drivers often raced along the road, with its ""blind corners and little bends"". She and her fellow members approved proposals to drop the speed limit from 60mph to 50mph and install average speed cameras along the A149. Prince Philip, 97, regularly drives in the Sandringham area The meeting was told there had been 40 accidents resulting in injury since 2012, including five deaths. The proportion of those accidents resulting in death or serious injury was ""almost double the national average"",said the report,externalbefore councillors. Speaking afterwards, Ms Walker said the A149 had been discussed at ""virtually every meeting"" of the committee but the topic had been ""pushed to the side"". ""I think the fact that it was the Duke of Edinburgh involved yesterday, it has brought this right to the forefront, and I think we will now see some speedy work done,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say it was an accident waiting to happen, but it is something we have highlighted previously. ""Unfortunately it was who it was, and I hate to say this, but if it hadn't have been him would we be discussing this today?"" Damage to the Land Rover's left side could be seen after the crash The meeting was arranged before the duke's crash, in which two women in a Kia suffered minor injuries. They were taken to a hospital while a nine-month boy in the car was uninjured. Committee chairman Martin Wilby sent ""extreme sympathy"" to those involved. Norfolk's Police and Crime Commissioner, Lorne Green, who lives in nearby Snettisham, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that he had been travelling on the road for ""40 years on and off"" and had ""seen a tremendous build up of traffic"", especially where it meets with Station Road and Beach Road, about 10 minutes from the crash site. ""I really feel that I am taking my life into my hands whenever I have to cross the road at that junction,"" he said. Debris at the scene where Prince Philip was involved in a traffic accident Norfolk's former roads policing chief said Prince Philip would be treated ""like any other driver"" by police. Retired chief inspector Chris Spinks, who led the county's traffic team for five years, said the force would be treating the crash as ""critical incident"" due to the global interest in the case. The status is used for investigations where public safety or the force's reputation is at stake and will mean scrutiny from senior officers ""to ensure nothing is missed"", he said He said officers would be likely to follow-up on first-hand accounts by interviewing those involved, including Prince Philip, the day after the crash. ""If I was in my old job I would want an eye on what's going on, because there are reputational issues for Norfolk Constabulary if it's not handled properly,"" he said. As an older driver, the duke's eyesight and fitness to drive could also be investigated, said Mr Spinks, who added there would be ""no favouritism"". ""In terms of process he will be dealt with like any other driver. ""Dealing with someone from the Royal Family is only different in that you probably can't pick up the phone to talk to them,"" he said. Witnesses said the duke was ""conscious but very, very shocked and shaken"" as he was helped out of the vehicle. A man who helped to free him from the crash said he saw the Land Rover ""careering"" across the road. Norfolk Police said the two women involved in the crash - aged 28 and 45 - have since been discharged from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. The driver suffered cuts, while the passenger sustained an arm injury, police said. The force said it would be ""inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out"". Is age a factor behind the wheel? Duke's car 'careered' across road People helped at crash scene, witness says There were 40 crashes - five of which were fatal - on the A149, which is the main route along the Norfolk coast, in the six years from 2012-2018. A council report recommended lowering the speed limit and installing average speed cameras along the road between the Knights Hill roundabout and Snettisham - an idea originally proposed in 2015. The average speed camera system will cover the A149 from the junction with the A148, about two and a half miles south of the crash scene, to Snettisham, six miles to the north. Residents have previously raised concerns about a number of junctions along the A149, which is used by more than 15,000 vehicles a day. This video can not be played The BBC's Nicholas Witchell says the duke regularly drives in the Sandringham area Prince Phillip is back at Sandringham, where he has been staying with the Queen since Christmas, and has seen a doctor as a precaution. The force said it was standard policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. A woman who drove past the crash scene said she saw an ambulance and ""a heavy police presence"". She added: ""I saw a black, 4x4 type car on its side and me and my son were like 'oh my word, that doesn't look good'. ""Obviously it looked quite smashed in. I'm quite amazed he [the duke] is OK actually."" Prince Philip retired from public life in August 2017having spent decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. He did not attend the Royal Family's Christmas Day service at Sandringham last month.

"After the Duke of Edinburghwas involved in a road crash where he was at the wheel,there was surprise in some quarters that he was still driving at the age of 97. But he's not alone. The number of people over 90 holding a driving licence in Britain has been on the rise - it recently topped 100,000. So should you still be driving in your 90s? The number of over-70s holding a driving licence exceeded five million for the first time last year, but figures suggest concerns that older drivers pose a danger are unfounded. AA president Edmund King said high profile car crashes involving elderly drivers often spark calls for bans or restrictions - but it is younger drivers who pose more of a risk. ""Young, predominantly male, drivers are much more likely to crash within six months of passing their test than older drivers within six months of hanging up their keys,"" he said. ""Older drivers often self-restrict their driving by not driving at night and only driving on familiar roads."" By BBC Reality Check In November 2018, there were 5.3 million over-70s with full driving licences in Britain, according to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). There were 11,245 people involved in road traffic accidents where the driver was in that age group - a rate of two per 1,000 licence holders. For Britain's 2.8 million drivers aged 17 to 24, the rate was more than four times as high, at nine per 1,000. The DVLA did not provide figures on whether this simply reflected that the older age group were on the road less than the younger age group. However, a separate study from the National Travel Survey suggests that over-70s drive an average of 1,000 miles a year more than under-20s. A Swansea University study in 2016found drivers aged 70 were involved in three to four times fewer accidents than men aged between 17-21. Malcolm Tarling, from the Association of British Insurers, says car insurance claims point to the average cost increasing once you are aged over 80. However, he says age is not the only factor insurers will consider and older drivers with good records will see this reflected in the cost of their car insurance - so being older is not always seen in a negative light. In the UK, 110,790 people aged 90 or over still held driving licences, according to the figures released by the DVLA in November. The duke, who is five months short of his 98th birthday, famously drove the Obamas when the then-US president and first lady visited Windsor in 2016. This video can not be played Prince Philip was 94 when he drove the Obamas and his wife, the Queen There were 314 licence holders aged at least 100. The oldest were four people who were 107. Once you reach 70, your driving licence automatically expires. To renew it, you must fill in a self-assessment declaring you are medically fit to continue driving - but you do not actually have to pass a test. You have to reapply every three years. To drive legally, you must also be able to read a number plate from 20m (65ft) away. The Association of Optometrists has previously called for those behind the wheel to havecompulsory eye tests every 10 years. You also need to tell the DVLA if you develop any medical conditions that could affect your ability to drive safely. Eileen Ash, from Norfolk, is 107 years oldand the world's oldest living international cricketer (male or female).She has been driving since passing her test 82 years ago but has decided ""the time has come"" to give up driving. She says there is no particular reason she is stopping now but came to the decision on her own and will miss it ""terribly"". ""It's about time. It's a thing you decide - you know when you have to give it up,"" she says. Eileen Ash, 107, passed her driving test in 1937 Fred Wright decided to retire from driving last year aged 90. His daughter Jennifer Broomfield, 66, admitted neither her dad nor her family wanted to address the issue at first. She said: ""I think his reactions were getting slower - he knew that himself. ""Driving had become stressful for him but he didn't want to address it at first."" Mr Wright, who lives just outside of Peterborough, decided to stop after a conversation with his family. His two daughters now provide regular lifts to help out. Mrs Broomfield added: ""I was worried about him but I think he's adapted really well - and it's stress free."" Fred Wright with his wife Betty, aged 91, at an exhibition at Peterborough Cathedral. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said age was ""a pretty poor indicator"" of driving ability. She said: ""We certainly don't think there is a place for arbitrary upper age limits for driving - the evidence suggests this would unfairly penalise many older people who are perfectly capable of driving safely."" The Older Drivers website,,externalwhich advises senior citizens how to drive safely, says you should be the one to decide when it's time to stop driving unless you are medically unfit to drive. The website, set up by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, also suggests talking to friends, family or your GP as they can help you to see problems you may not have noticed. If you feel someone's driving is affecting their safety, or putting other people in danger, Ms Abrahams says you have a responsibility to talk to them about it. The charity's website,externalsuggests doing some research so you can offer suggestions to help that person keep their independence, such as looking at public transport options. Age UK says: ""Approach the subject sensitively and tactfully. It may be difficult if the person reacts defensively, gets upset or feels humiliated. ""Encourage the person to think about whether they're putting themselves and others at risk which might help them consider whether their driving is a concern."" The Older Drivers Forum,external- a charity that aims to keep older drivers on the road safely for longer - suggests looking out for the following signs: Slower reaction times Difficulty in turning to see when reversing Keeping a foot on the brake Other drivers sounding their horns at them Incorrect signals Hitting the kerb Trouble making turns Confusion at exits Over-revving the engine, especially on low-speed manoeuvres Difficulties with low-light or night-time driving Avoidance of driving to new or unfamiliar places Scrapes and dents in the car Drivers aged over 90 top 100,000 Older drivers 'no more dangerous' UK drivers urged to retake eye test Prince Philip's car 'careered' across road New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Trump's attorney general nominee William Barr is quizzed about obstruction US President Donald Trump has hit back over a news report that he directed his then personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News said Mr Trump had instructed Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was convicted over the case last month. Mr Trump said the lawyer was lying about the Moscow project to ""reduce his jail time"". The office of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller also disputed the report. A spokesman for Mr Mueller - who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump campaign figures were complicit - said Buzzfeed's ""description of specific statements"" and ""characterisation of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate"". Democratic politicians say they will investigate Buzzfeed's allegations. Buzzfeed says its report is based on testimony from two unnamed law enforcement officials,externalinvestigating the matter. The story alleges Mr Trump received 10 personal updates from Cohen about a plan to build the Moscow tower at a time when Mr Trump denied having any business ties to Russia. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was All you need to know about Trump Russia story Seven legal headaches for the president Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son, Donald Jnr, were also updated, the story alleges. Mr Mueller has already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Cohen told Congress talks over the plan had taken place between September 2015 and January 2016 but criminal complaint documents say they lasted until June. Cohen said the plan had been halted earlier in an attempt to ""minimise links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1"" during the election campaign. Individual 1 has previously been identified by Cohen as Mr Trump. Buzzfeed says Cohen has told investigators that Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" about the date negotiations ended ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"" The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The report said Mr Mueller had other evidence, including from interviews with other Trump organisation staff and internal company emails, to corroborate Cohen's version of events. The report also says Mr Trump allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News With the longest government shutdown in history poised to stretch into a fifth week, Washington has become a political powder keg. The report on Thursday night that there is documentary evidence Donald Trump directed his former attorney to lie to Congress just lit a big fuse. If the Buzzfeed story is substantiated - and it asserts this evidence is already in the hands of Mr Mueller - this would appear to present a strong case for presidential obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a hearing on Tuesday, prompted attorney general nominee William Barr to acknowledge as much. Already the quiet whispers of impeachment among House Democrats are getting louder. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been able to tamp down this sentiment so far, but she may be unable - or unwilling - to keep it under wraps much longer. For almost two years, Mr Mueller's Russia investigation has been a cipher, with details of its activities coming only in opaque legal filings and anonymous accounts of unascertainable veracity. It seems the time for him to put his cards on the table and end the speculation and parlour-game guessing is rapidly approaching. In fact it's past time, if you ask some Democrats. The intelligence committee of the House of Representatives will investigate the claims, says its new chairman, Adam Schiff.He said the allegations against Mr Trump,externalwere ""among the most serious to date"". The head of the House judiciary committee, Jerrold Nadler, said it would also work to ""get to the bottom"" of the case. Some Democrats reacted by calling for impeachment. This video can not be played How the jailing of Cohen affects Trump Representative Ted Lieu tweeted,externalthat the story established a ""clear case of Obstruction of Justice, a felony"". Representative for Texas Joaquin Castro,externalsaid that if the story were true ""President Trump must resign or be impeached"". The president's response on Twitter,externalmainly retweeted a Fox News reporter's comment that Cohen had been ""convicted of perjury and fraud"", though the president added ""Lying to reduce his jail time!"" The president's current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, issued a statement on Friday saying that ""any suggestion from any source that the president counselled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false"". Earlier, Mr Giuliani told the Washington Post,external: ""If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge."" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News it was ""ludicrous"" to give credibility to Buzzfeed, saying its ""uncorroborated"" story was the kind of fake news the president and his team had to deal with daily. He said that Cohen had been ""proven to be a liar"". Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. It is up to the attorney general to notify Congress and decide whether the report will be released publicly. Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? President Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is currently undergoing confirmation in Congress. He has said he will make as much of the Mueller report public as possible but has not promised to publish it all. Cohen was sentenced in New York last month So far Mr Mueller's investigation has led to charges against more than two dozen Russians, as well as several people connected to Mr Trump himself, including his former national security adviser and the former chairman of his election campaign. A number of them, including Cohen, are known to be co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. How could the president be impeached? How will history judge President Trump? Cohen's help to Russia probe revealed Cohen must report to prison by 6 March, but before that, he has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in February.

"The UK has yet to finalise agreements to replace existing free trade deals the EU has with 40 big economies if there is a no-deal Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he ""hoped"" they would but it depended on whether other countries were ""willing to put the work in"". He said more deals were coming, after signing one with Australia. Concerns have been raised that the UK will leave the EU without a deal that would protect current arrangements. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, under the Article 50 process and the UK's EU Withdrawal Act, with or without a deal - unless the UK chooses to revoke Article 50 and continues as a member of the EU. MPs defeated the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by a huge margin earlier this week, which provided for a ""transition period"" of 21 months, under which much of the UK's relationship with the EU would remain the same.

Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal' plan Farage seeking 'new party' for elections Top Germans plead with UK to stay in EU Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit In 2017, Mr Fox said that the UK could ""replicate the 40 free trade agreements before we leave the EU"", so that there would be no disruption to trade. But with just over two months to go until Brexit, not one has been signed, said the BBC's business correspondent Jonty Bloom. The Department for International Trade says some agreements are at an advanced stage but none of the 40 free trade deals that the EU has with other countries have so far been rolled over so that they will cover the UK after Brexit. The closest the UK has come to rolling over a free trade deal is an initial agreement with Switzerland to replicate the existing EU-Switzerland arrangements ""as far as possible"".  But that deal has not been formally signed yet. Asked abouta report in the Financial Times,externalthat Britain would not be close to finalising most of the 40 free trade deals the EU currently has with other countries, Mr Fox told the BBC: ""I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK. Our side is ready. ""It's largely dependent on other whether countries believe that there will be no deal and are willing to put the work in to the preparations."" On Friday, he signed a ""mutual recognition agreement"" with the Australian high commissioner in London - to maintain all current relevant aspects of the agreement it has with the EU. The EU does not have a free trade agreement with Australia. He said there would be a ""pipeline of them to be signed as we go through"" and the agreement made it easier for UK goods to comply with Australian standards. Mr Fox also said that staying in a permanent customs arrangement with the EU would ""not be delivering Brexit"" as he did not believe it would allow the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. Some opposition parties have been making the case for a customs union. Theresa May held talks with the leaders of parties including the SNP and the Lib Dems, about a way forward after she won a confidence vote by a narrow margin in the Commons on Wednesday. She also spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on the telephone on Thursday night, and will be speaking to more EU leaders over the weekend.

But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants the UK to be in a permanent customs union with ""strong"" ties to the single market, has refused to take part in talks with the prime minister until she rules out the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal. In a letter to Mrs May, Mr Corbyn said her talks were ""not genuine"". He also accused her of ""sticking rigidly"" to her withdrawal agreement. As many as 20 Tory ministers have also said they would quit the government unless the prime minister allows them to try to stop a no deal Brexit,according to the Telegraph,external. Mrs May says ruling out no deal is impossible as it is not within the government's power. Writingin the Financial Times,external, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservative Party was ""riven with division"" so Labour would ""return to Parliament to promote the compromise we believe is not only in the best interests of our economy but is also capable of securing sufficient support both here and in Brussels"".

On Friday a pro-referendum campaign group paid for a wrap-around advertisement in his local newspaper, theIslington Tribune,external, urging him to back a ""public vote on Brexit"". In a speech at JCB Headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said changing the date of leaving from 29 March would be ""shameful"", and the public would view it as ""an elite conspiracy to thwart Brexit"".

"This video can not be played Ian Lewis says he ""needs help"" to look after the artwork The latest Banksy artwork, which appeared on the side of a garage in Port Talbot in December, has been sold privately for a ""six-figure sum"". Season's Greetings has been bought by Essex-based gallery owner John Brandler, who said he will keep the graffiti work in the town. About 20,000 people are thought to have visited the artwork in the past month. Steelworker Ian Lewis, who originally owned the artwork, said the sale was ""a weight off my shoulders"". Brandler Galleries, owned by Mr Brandler, has several works by the Bristolian artist. Mr Brandler said Season's Greetings would stay in Port Talbot for ""a minimum of two to three years"". What has happened to other Banksy works? Buyer 'willing to pay Â£100k for Banksy' ""It's where it belongs,"" he said. ""It could be the control magnet for other tourist-based opportunities in the town. Ian Lewis (left) said he was relieved to sell the Banksy artwork to John Brandler ""I have other pieces by Banksy and, depending what is discussed with the local council and the Welsh Government, I could have half a dozen Banksys on display in the town. ""Let's take it and move it into the middle of the town where the public can see it without anybody stopping them."" He said he had paid more than Â£100,000 for the artwork. Mr Brandler also praised Mr Lewis, who turned down higher offers in order to keep the work in Port Talbot. ""Ian was amazing not going for the highest price to keep it in the community,"" Mr Brandler said. ""I think an awful lot of people would have taken the money and run, but he wasn't selfish and he deserves recognition for that."" Banksy sale raises Â£400k for club Banksy confirms new 'snow' artwork is his Mr Lewis, 55, who found the mural on his garage one week before Christmas, said the whole experience had been ""life changing"". He said: ""I think the town has fallen in love with it, I think everybody loves it and it would have been a shame for it to move from the area. ""There were lots of offers, lots of options of what people wanted to do with it. There were art collectors, dealers, people who wanted to take it away basically."" Volunteers estimate more than 20,000 people have visited the Banksy ""The artwork is going to be moved and I'll rebuild the garage. I think that every graffiti artist in the area is going to come down and have a go at it now though, although I don't think Banksy will be back again,"" Mr Lewis added. ""I'm still thinking about what to do. Now the stress has been lifted off me I should have more time to think about what I really want to do. I'm planning to stay here, maybe a few little holidays, but I'm going to stay in Port Talbot. ""Personally I think it was an ideal spot for the theme of the artwork. I don't think it was anything to do with me, just the garage.""

"Hundreds of thousands of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers were unable to make payments from their online accounts today. Some have been facing the frustration of not being able to pay and transfer money online. Others were not able to confirm whether funds were arriving in their account. A spokesperson for Lloyds Banking Group, which owns the three brands, apologised but said its systems were now back up and running. ""However due to the issues experienced today there may be a delay in processing some of the payments that customers made earlier in the day. We continue to advise customers that they should not submit a second payment, to avoid duplicate payments being processed."" The bank said no customers would be out of pocket as a result of the IT issue. Steve Davis, a quality engineer from Leicester said he was caught out by the problems this morning, when he was notified that a client's money had been transferred, but it failed to appear in his Halifax bank account. ""I got a notification of a transfer going in from the [banking] app... by 11 o'clock it hadn't appeared. Then by midday it still hadn't appeared"".

"Arif Ansari checked his reporter's script before it was broadcast, the court has heard BBC Asian Network's head of news has been found not guilty over the naming of a sexual abuse victim in a live radio broadcast. Arif Ansari checked and approved a reporter's script which named the woman, believing it was a pseudonym. Victims of sexual offences are given lifetime anonymity by law. After a two-day case Mr Ansari was found not guilty by a district judge at Sheffield Magistrates' Court, who said the broadcast was an ""honest mistake"". Mr Ansari was on trial accused of breaching the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992. He denied the charge. A BBC spokesman said: ""From the start we have accepted that mistakenly naming a victim of sexual abuse during a live broadcast last February was a serious mistake. ""The CPS had a choice to charge the BBC and/or the editor. We firmly believe that it should have been the BBC itself answering in court for this mistake, rather than the individual editor. ""We are relieved with the court's decision today."" The charge related to a live radio broadcast on 6 February last year. The journalist involved in the broadcast, Rickin Majithia, had gone to Sheffield Crown Court to hear evidence in a trial linked to the Rotherham sex abuse scandal when a victim's real name was used, the courtheard on the opening day of Mr Ansari's trial. Mr Majithia told the district judge, Naomi Redhouse, that he wrongly thought the name used was a pseudonym. His report, including the name which was described as a pseudonym, was broadcast as part of a live news bulletin and the woman - who was a victim of the Rotherham abuse - was listening to the radio when her name was read out. She said she went into ""full meltdown"", the court heard. The charge was brought against Mr Ansari, in his capacity as editor. Mr Ansari had the role of checking and approving the script before it was broadcast, the court heard. Giving evidence to a judge sitting at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Friday, Mr Ansari, 44, said he considered reporter Mr Majithia to be an excellent colleague who was very driven. ""I trusted his journalism,"" Mr Ansari said. ""He was a good journalist. ""This was not a complex legal issue. This is as basic as it gets. This is what journalists are taught at journalism school."" Mr Ansari added: ""It just struck me as 100% accurate. Rickin was a senior journalist, one of my senior reporters. ""He had a background, professional relationship with the victim in question. I didn't. I had never met her. I was in London. ""Furthermore, I knew that he knew that he could not name her, use her real name. Put all these factors together, it did not occur to me that this could be wrong. ""I trusted my reporter and the reason I sent him to Sheffield was to make sure he got it right."" Mr Ansari added that he regarded Mr Majithia as a ""loose cannon"" at times, but only because of a lack of co-ordination about what he was doing. After the live on-air news report was broadcast and named the victim on 6 February last year, Mr Ansari said Mr Majithia called him in a state of panic saying: ""I've got the name wrong, it wasn't a pseudonym, it was her real name."" Mr Ansari told the court the pair met in a pub in London later that evening, where Mr Ansari says he was shocked to realise that Mr Majithia had never reported from court before. ""I remember being somewhat shocked that he hadn't previously told me that,"" he told the court. Mr Ansari described Mr Majithia as ""very badly shaken"" and ""in a really bad way"" when he returned to London. Previously on Thursday - the first day of the trial - the court heard a witness statement from the woman who said she was ""panicking and crying"". She said she had found the process of giving evidence in the sex abuse trial at Sheffield Crown Court difficult and added: ""To then have my name given out as a victim of rape on a BBC radio station was unbelievable and made me feel sick"". The court also heard how Mr Majithia had sent Mr Ansari his script for approval at about 16:35 GMT, and it was broadcast live at 17:00. Mr Majithia explained to the court how the woman gave evidence in court from behind a screen and he wrongly assumed that when her forename was used in court it was a pseudonym. The reporter said that he had a number of previous dealings with the woman as he investigated the Rotherham abuse scandal and had become confused, thinking that the name he had always called her was her real one, when it was not. The prosecution had said it accepted Mr Ansari did not know or suspect the victim's real name was in the script but said he had good reason to suspect the name that was used might be wrong because Mr Majithia was inexperienced. Mr Ansari was charged with - and then cleared of - breaching theSexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,external, which entitles all complainants of sexual offences to lifelong anonymity. From the moment a complaint of sexual abuse is made, all publishers and broadcasters are banned from naming the complainant unless they choose to waive their anonymity or a court orders otherwise. It is the first time a BBC editor had been charged under this Act.

"This video can not be played Interview with so-called 'IS Beatles' duo The mother of one of four suspected Islamic State fighters has lost a legal challenge against the UK's sharing of evidence with the US without seeking assurances he would not be executed. El Shafee Elsheikh is accused of belonging to an IS cell which is thought to have beheaded hostages. He is being held with another suspected cell member in northern Syria, and they may face prosecution in the US. The court ruled the UK has no legal duty to protect Mr Elsheikh. Britain shared 600 witness statements gathered by the Metropolitan Police with the US under a process called ""mutual legal assistance"" (MLA). Mr Elsheikh's mother, Maha Elgizouli, challenged the government's decision. She argued that, due to the UK's stance on the death penalty, the government should have ensured her son would not face execution if he was extradited and tried in the US. She also stated that it went against her own human rights, and breached data protection laws. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said: ""There is no general, common law duty on Her Majesty's government to take positive steps to protect an individual's life from the actions of a third party and that includes requiring particular undertakings before complying with the MLA request."" Mr Elsheikh and the other suspected IS fighter, Alexanda Kotey, were raised in the UK, but no longer have British citizenships. The two, who are being held by Syrian-Kurdish forces, are accused of being a part of a terrorist cell known as ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents. The cell are believed to have murdered foreign hostages, including Alan Henning, James Foley and David Haines; created brutal propaganda videos, and tortured dozens of people. The other two members of the group - also from London - were Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. Mohammed Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike and Aine Davis was sentenced to prison in Turkey. All four were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria. By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent This judgement paves the way for the two Londoners to be prosecuted in the USA - after a fraught series of talks over what to do with them. Documents in the case show that the US administration became frustrated with the UK's refusal to take the men back while trying to tell it what to do with them if they were instead to face justice in America. In fact, the British ambassador in Washington warned President Trump could ""hold a grudge"" if the UK persisted in asking for a death penalty assurance. Ms Elgizouli's lawyers argued that the UK's long-standing opposition to the death penalty was therefore cast aside in the interests of political expediency. But today's judgement underlines that no law has been broken. Mr Elsheikh is not British - nor is he under UK control - so the obligations on ministers to act on his mother's concerns are limited. In the past, Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. In this case, intelligence was shared with the US but no such assurances were sought. However, information sharing was halted last month after Mr Elsheikh's mother launched a legal challenge. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said:  ""My priority has always been to ensure we deliver justice for the victims' families and that the individuals suspected of these sickening crimes face prosecution as quickly as possible. ""Our longstanding opposition to the death penalty has not changed. ""Any evidence shared with the US in this case must be for the express purpose of progressing a federal prosecution."" Ms Elgizouli's solicitor said that she found the decision difficult to take on board. Gareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, said that while Ms Elgizouli thinks her son should be prosecuted, she argues that it should take place within accordance of international human rights standards. ""Ms Elgizouli hopes that the opportunity will be given for the Supreme Court to consider whether it has a greater ability to explore the important factors raised in the case she has brought,"" Ms Peirce said.

"This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Electric carmaker Tesla has said it will cut its workforce by 7% after the ""most challenging"" year in its history. In an email to staff on the firm's website, founder Elon Musk said that growth had been strong. But he added it was difficult to make Teslas with their new and developing technology as cheaply as conventional cars, and the firm's cars were still ""too expensive for most people"". Tesla employs more than 45,000 people, indicating it will cut about 3,000. Shares in the car manufacturer opened more than 6% lower as trading began in the US on Friday. Mr Musk said 2018 was Tesla's ""most successful"" yet, in which it delivered almost as many cars as it had in all the previous years of its existence combined. The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk However, while it ramped up production of its mid-market Model 3 car, Mr Musk said its products were too pricey for the average driver and its profits too low. Tesla has stepped up production of its mid-market Model 3 car ""This quarter will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,"" he wrote. ""However, starting around May, we will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles. ""Moreover, we need to continue making progress towards lower priced variants of Model 3."" He said Tesla had ""no choice"" but to reduce full-time employee headcount and retain ""only the most critical temps and contractors"". He added the firm would need to make these cuts while ""increasing the Model 3 production rate"" and making many ""manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months"". It's been a tough few years for the electric carmaker and its high-profile founder. The firm has repeatedly failed to meet its own production targets, leading many investors to bet against it. Theo Leggett, business correspondent Tesla is in a race against time. It's already well established as a niche producer of upmarket electric vehicles. But that isn't where the company sees its future. Electric cars at the moment are in many ways a lifestyle choice. But in future, ever tighter emissions regulations and restrictions on ""regular"" cars are expected to drive them into the mainstream. It's potentially a huge market - and Tesla is targeting a significant share. That's the rationale behind its brand new Model 3, billed as an ""affordable"" electric car. But the Model 3 isn't actually that affordable yet - the cheapest versions have yet to go on sale. And it needs to make a lot more of them, in order to benefit from economies of scale. Meanwhile established manufacturers will soon be flooding the market with brand new EVs of their own. Last year the priority for Tesla was simply to boost production as quickly as possible, to meet ambitious targets. It took on a lot of new employees to make that happen. Now, it needs to make even more cars, more cheaply - and it will have to do so with fewer staff. That certainly won't be easy, but according to Elon Musk, ""there isn't any other way"". Mr Musk was also caught up in a number of scandals, including being sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission after tweeting that he planned to take Tesla private. Some analysts have speculated that Tesla will turn the ship around this year, but earlier this month it fell short on quarterly deliveries of the Model 3. It also had to cut prices in the US to offset lower green tax credits. In his email, Mr Musk noted the firm was cutting the jobs after expanding its headcount by almost a third in 2018. ""Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we're up against massive, entrenched competitors,"" he said. ""The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.""

"Ryanair has cut its profit forecast blaming lower-than-expected air fares. The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said Ryanair could not rule out having to cut fares further. Fares are expected to fall 7% this winter. He said the low fares were already causing problems for rivals, including Flybe which was rescued last week. Full-year profits are now expected to be in a range of â¬1.0bn to â¬1.1bn (Â£880m to Â£970m), compared with its previous forecast of â¬1.1bn to â¬1.2bn. The profit forecast has been cut despite Ryanair saying it expects to carry more passengers than forecast. It had previously warned on profits in October. Mr O'Leary said there was too much capacity on short-haul routes in Europe this winter, adding that customers were enjoying ""record lower air fares"". Ryanair named 'worst short-haul airline' Ryanair compensation claims to go to court Ryanair warns on profits as strikes hit income ""We believe this lower fare environment will continue to shake out more loss making competitors, with WOW, Flybe, and reportedly Germania for example, all currently for sale,"" he said. The airline had previously expected air fares to fall by 2%, rather than 7%. More cuts could be coming,  Mr O'Leary added. ""While we have reasonable visibility over forward bookings [for the fourth quarter], we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower full year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely impact yields between now and the end of March,"" he said. The announcement follows last week's rescue of Flybe,which has received an offer from a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. Thousands of Ryanair passengers were hit by strikes last year It also comes after difficult period for Ryanair, which wasnamed the UK's least-liked short-haul airlinefor the sixth year running in a survey carried out by consumer body Which?. Strikes by staff during the summer season forced it to cancel hundreds of flights for which it has refused to offer passengers compensation, and Which? said ""thousands of respondents"" had said they would never fly with the airline again. The impact of these strikes was reflected in Ryanair'shalf-year results in October, when it reported a 7% fall in profits, although the airline was also affected by industrial action by air traffic controllers. Ryanair said the latest profits guidance excluded start-up losses in Austrian airline Lauda, which have been cut from â¬150m to â¬140m thanks to lower-than-expected costs. Mr O'Leary said the airline was winning market share, citing plans by rival carrier Norwegian to close bases in Rome, Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Palma, where the airlines compete.

"You might have blamed the winter gloom, but if the traffic ahead of you appears a bit drab, it is because the view really is greyer than it was. Half a million of us chose to buy a grey car in 2018, making it the most popular colour for the first time, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Just over one in five new car registrations last year were grey in the UK. More than half of new cars registered were either black, grey or white. Car sales fell in 2018, so almost every shade saw a decline in the numbers of each colour sold. The exceptions were orange, which grew in popularity by 37% and beige which increased 28%. Cream was the biggest faller on the colour chart with just 559 drivers choosing it in 2018. Silver, previously a favourite, was no longer among the top five. Primary colours Broken down regionally, the trends were slightly different in Scotland, where white was the biggest seller. However in Northern Ireland and Wales grey remained popular.

"Pharmacists say they are struggling to obtain many common medicines including painkillers and anti-depressants. This is leaving patients complaining of delays in getting hold of drugs and pharmacists paying over the odds for common medicines. The BBC has found there has been a big rise in the number of drugs on the ""shortage of supply"" list for England. There are80 medicines,externalin such short supply that the Department of Health has agreed to pay a premium for them. This is up from 45 in October, although there was a spike in November 2017. There are a number of reasons why this has happened, but there are now concerns that uncertainty over Brexit will only make the situation worse. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society said there was ""a massive shortage and price spikes"". There is concern that this could affect some pharmacies' ability to deliver medicines, and cost the NHS more. Pharmacies and patients in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland also appear to be experiencing similar shortages. Most people should be able to get their prescriptions filled as normal. But if they need one of the drugs that is running short, they might not be so lucky. Melanie, who has fibromyalgia - a condition which causes pain all over the body - and hypermobility, wasn't able to get the anti-inflammatory naproxen from her pharmacist in December. Instead, she was given ibuprofen which didn't have the same effect. ""I was in floods of tears with the pain - it was awful,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""It makes a massive difference in my condition."" Without the drug, Melanie's inflammation increased to the point where she dislocated her thumb. ""It's difficult to explain how hard it is to deal with, suffering from chronic pain."" Melanie has experienced her drugs being out of stock before, but they usually reappear reasonably quickly. This time, that hasn't happened. Some pharmacists are sending patients back to their GPs to ask for a different medicine or dosage. Others are giving as much of a drug as they can spare and sending people away with IOU notes for the remainder. The best advice is to make sure you get prescriptions to your pharmacist in good time. It is almost always possible to come up with an alternative. However, that can be more difficult with conditions like epilepsy, where patients need to be on specific drugs. What would 'no deal' mean for food and medicine? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit Is NHS already finding it hard to get medicines? It is hard to obtain a definitive tally of which medicines are running short. But the industry in England uses a list from the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC). It shows which drugs are in such short supply and for which ones the NHS has agreed to temporarily pay a higher price. The BBC has analysed this data and found that the number of medications on the list has grown six-fold in three years. During this time period, the peak was in November 2017, but there has been a recent surge and figures for December show it is approaching that level again. Academic researchers in Oxford University estimate that the cost of the 80 drugs in short supply would have trebled in December,external, from Â£11.4m to Â£37m. This is the extra cost being paid by pharmacists, and then reimbursed by the NHS, for drugs in short supply. This is about prescriptions for generic medicines, rather than specific brand names. For example, Nurofen is a common painkiller, but you can buy the same generic drug, ibuprofen. Ash Soni, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says he has never seen so many common drugs affected by shortages. He explains: ""The items are out of stock and unavailable. Patients are having to wait. ""We're having to send some patients back to the GP to get a different prescription, because we just can't fill them."" On December 2018's concession list, 28 drugs, or about a third, were among the 500 most commonly prescribed. For example, furosemide is used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems. It comes in various dosages, but one type, 40mg tablets, is the 23rd most commonly prescribed drug in England. Other drugs on the list include fluoxetine, which treats depression, and naproxen, which is an anti-inflammatory. Mr Soni says naproxen went ""completely out of stock"" recently. He did manage to track some down eventually, but it cost Â£6.49 a box - Â£2 more than the NHS last agreed to pay for it. He says: ""I've ordered 20 boxes today and that will last me about two or three days. ""We're dispensing at a loss. We're paying for patients to get their meds on the behalf of the NHS."" Warwick Smith, director general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, says stock levels can fluctuate. He prefers to call it a ""tightening of supply"" rather than a shortage. ""It's normal for levels of availability to increase and decrease, which impacts prices,"" he adds. The government stresses that two million prescription items are dispensed in England every day, and the vast majority of medicines are not in short supply. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We continue to work closely with industry and partners to ensure patients receive the medicines they need and pharmacies are reimbursed fairly."" Industry figures all stress that there is no single, neat answer to explain such a complicated situation. Suggestions for reasons behind the shortage include: increased global demand cost of raw materials new regulatory requirements driving up costs fluctuations in exchange rates generic companies being unwilling to carry on selling unprofitable products. Another possible explanation is that the NHS has done too good a job of driving down the prices it will pay for drugs. The PSNC says this makes the UK a less attractive market for manufacturers. The government has told manufacturers of both branded and generic drugs to stockpile six weeks' worth of supplies, so that people would still get their medications if we have a no-deal Brexit. Hospitals, distributors and patients have been told not to stockpile their own supplies. Medicine shortages were at their worst in 2017, and although recent figures show the issue could return to that level again, one expert says Brexit is ""not a factor"". ""Shortages have been a problem for some years. It's a fluctuating problem. They are now worse than ever,"" said former Liberal Democrat MP Sandra Gidley, a pharmacist and chairwoman of the English Pharmacy Board at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Potential supply problems because of Brexit have led to manufactures being asked to keep a ""buffer stock"", Ms Gidley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Unfortunately what's been happening on social media over Christmas is that people have beenâ¦ assuming this is because of Brexit. There are global issues at play here."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We have not seen any evidence of current medicine supply issues linked to EU exit preparations."" The Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Scotland said the issue was a permanent feature of pharmacy life and can happen for a variety of reasons. But Gareth Jones, of the National Pharmacy Association, thought while patients were not panicking, ""unconscious stockpiling"" along the supply chain appeared to be a ""significant factor"". Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distribution Association, which circulates 92% of medicines in the UK, said some businesses could be ""speculating on Brexit"" - investing in stock in order to make money from it later. ""That's the nature of the market,"" he said. Data analysis by Clara Guibourg and Wesley Stephenson Is NHS finding it hard to get drugs?

"This video can not be played Interview with so-called 'IS Beatles' duo The mother of one of four suspected Islamic State fighters has lost a legal challenge against the UK's sharing of evidence with the US without seeking assurances he would not be executed. El Shafee Elsheikh is accused of belonging to an IS cell which is thought to have beheaded hostages. He is being held with another suspected cell member in northern Syria, and they may face prosecution in the US. The court ruled the UK has no legal duty to protect Mr Elsheikh. Britain shared 600 witness statements gathered by the Metropolitan Police with the US under a process called ""mutual legal assistance"" (MLA). Mr Elsheikh's mother, Maha Elgizouli, challenged the government's decision. She argued that, due to the UK's stance on the death penalty, the government should have ensured her son would not face execution if he was extradited and tried in the US. She also stated that it went against her own human rights, and breached data protection laws. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said: ""There is no general, common law duty on Her Majesty's government to take positive steps to protect an individual's life from the actions of a third party and that includes requiring particular undertakings before complying with the MLA request."" Mr Elsheikh and the other suspected IS fighter, Alexanda Kotey, were raised in the UK, but no longer have British citizenships. The two, who are being held by Syrian-Kurdish forces, are accused of being a part of a terrorist cell known as ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents. The cell are believed to have murdered foreign hostages, including Alan Henning, James Foley and David Haines; created brutal propaganda videos, and tortured dozens of people. The other two members of the group - also from London - were Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. Mohammed Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike and Aine Davis was sentenced to prison in Turkey. All four were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria. By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent This judgement paves the way for the two Londoners to be prosecuted in the USA - after a fraught series of talks over what to do with them. Documents in the case show that the US administration became frustrated with the UK's refusal to take the men back while trying to tell it what to do with them if they were instead to face justice in America. In fact, the British ambassador in Washington warned President Trump could ""hold a grudge"" if the UK persisted in asking for a death penalty assurance. Ms Elgizouli's lawyers argued that the UK's long-standing opposition to the death penalty was therefore cast aside in the interests of political expediency. But today's judgement underlines that no law has been broken. Mr Elsheikh is not British - nor is he under UK control - so the obligations on ministers to act on his mother's concerns are limited. In the past, Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. In this case, intelligence was shared with the US but no such assurances were sought. However, information sharing was halted last month after Mr Elsheikh's mother launched a legal challenge. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said:  ""My priority has always been to ensure we deliver justice for the victims' families and that the individuals suspected of these sickening crimes face prosecution as quickly as possible. ""Our longstanding opposition to the death penalty has not changed. ""Any evidence shared with the US in this case must be for the express purpose of progressing a federal prosecution."" Ms Elgizouli's solicitor said that she found the decision difficult to take on board. Gareth Peirce, of Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, said that while Ms Elgizouli thinks her son should be prosecuted, she argues that it should take place within accordance of international human rights standards. ""Ms Elgizouli hopes that the opportunity will be given for the Supreme Court to consider whether it has a greater ability to explore the important factors raised in the case she has brought,"" Ms Peirce said.

"Ryanair has cut its profit forecast blaming lower-than-expected air fares. The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said Ryanair could not rule out having to cut fares further. Fares are expected to fall 7% this winter. He said the low fares were already causing problems for rivals, including Flybe which was rescued last week. Full-year profits are now expected to be in a range of â¬1.0bn to â¬1.1bn (Â£880m to Â£970m), compared with its previous forecast of â¬1.1bn to â¬1.2bn. The profit forecast has been cut despite Ryanair saying it expects to carry more passengers than forecast. It had previously warned on profits in October. Mr O'Leary said there was too much capacity on short-haul routes in Europe this winter, adding that customers were enjoying ""record lower air fares"". Ryanair named 'worst short-haul airline' Ryanair compensation claims to go to court Ryanair warns on profits as strikes hit income ""We believe this lower fare environment will continue to shake out more loss making competitors, with WOW, Flybe, and reportedly Germania for example, all currently for sale,"" he said. The airline had previously expected air fares to fall by 2%, rather than 7%. More cuts could be coming,  Mr O'Leary added. ""While we have reasonable visibility over forward bookings [for the fourth quarter], we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower full year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments which adversely impact yields between now and the end of March,"" he said. The announcement follows last week's rescue of Flybe,which has received an offer from a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. Thousands of Ryanair passengers were hit by strikes last year It also comes after difficult period for Ryanair, which wasnamed the UK's least-liked short-haul airlinefor the sixth year running in a survey carried out by consumer body Which?. Strikes by staff during the summer season forced it to cancel hundreds of flights for which it has refused to offer passengers compensation, and Which? said ""thousands of respondents"" had said they would never fly with the airline again. The impact of these strikes was reflected in Ryanair'shalf-year results in October, when it reported a 7% fall in profits, although the airline was also affected by industrial action by air traffic controllers. Ryanair said the latest profits guidance excluded start-up losses in Austrian airline Lauda, which have been cut from â¬150m to â¬140m thanks to lower-than-expected costs. Mr O'Leary said the airline was winning market share, citing plans by rival carrier Norwegian to close bases in Rome, Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Palma, where the airlines compete.

"Police released these images of Aiia Maasarwe, taken on the night she was killed A man has been arrested over the killing of a 21-year-old Israeli student in Melbourne, Australian police say. The body of Aiia Maasarwe, 21, was found near La Trobe University in the city's north. She had taken a tram home late on Tuesday after a comedy show. She was attacked while speaking on the phone to her sister, authorities said. A 20-year-old man was arrested in a nearby suburb on Friday. Victoria Police did not immediately provide further details but thanked the public for their help. Earlier, detectives said they were not ruling out the possibility that Ms Maasarwe had been sexually assaulted before her killing. ""Our presumption at this stage is that this was a random attack and opportunistic,"" Inspector Andrew Stamper told reporters on Thursday. The killing has caused widespread outrage in Australia, sparking renewed anger and debate about violence against women. On Friday evening, thousands of people took part in a vigil on the steps of the state parliament in central Melbourne. Earlier, hundreds gathered at La Trobe University to remember Aiia. Ms Maasarwe was on an exchange programme at La Trobe University Her father Saeed Maasarwe, who travelled to Australia from Israel, attended both vigils. He expressed gratitude for the support his family had received from the community and police. ""I am sad because this is the last place my daughter was,"" he said. ""I wish, I hope, I pray she is now is in a more nice place than this place and in the paradise."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Trump's attorney general nominee William Barr is quizzed about obstruction US President Donald Trump has hit back over a news report that he directed his then personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News said Mr Trump had instructed Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was convicted over the case last month. Mr Trump said the lawyer was lying about the Moscow project to ""reduce his jail time"". The office of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller also disputed the report. A spokesman for Mr Mueller - who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump campaign figures were complicit - said Buzzfeed's ""description of specific statements"" and ""characterisation of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate"". Democratic politicians say they will investigate Buzzfeed's allegations. Buzzfeed says its report is based on testimony from two unnamed law enforcement officials,externalinvestigating the matter. The story alleges Mr Trump received 10 personal updates from Cohen about a plan to build the Moscow tower at a time when Mr Trump denied having any business ties to Russia. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was All you need to know about Trump Russia story Seven legal headaches for the president Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son, Donald Jnr, were also updated, the story alleges. Mr Mueller has already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Cohen told Congress talks over the plan had taken place between September 2015 and January 2016 but criminal complaint documents say they lasted until June. Cohen said the plan had been halted earlier in an attempt to ""minimise links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1"" during the election campaign. Individual 1 has previously been identified by Cohen as Mr Trump. Buzzfeed says Cohen has told investigators that Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" about the date negotiations ended ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"" The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The report said Mr Mueller had other evidence, including from interviews with other Trump organisation staff and internal company emails, to corroborate Cohen's version of events. The report also says Mr Trump allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News With the longest government shutdown in history poised to stretch into a fifth week, Washington has become a political powder keg. The report on Thursday night that there is documentary evidence Donald Trump directed his former attorney to lie to Congress just lit a big fuse. If the Buzzfeed story is substantiated - and it asserts this evidence is already in the hands of Mr Mueller - this would appear to present a strong case for presidential obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a hearing on Tuesday, prompted attorney general nominee William Barr to acknowledge as much. Already the quiet whispers of impeachment among House Democrats are getting louder. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been able to tamp down this sentiment so far, but she may be unable - or unwilling - to keep it under wraps much longer. For almost two years, Mr Mueller's Russia investigation has been a cipher, with details of its activities coming only in opaque legal filings and anonymous accounts of unascertainable veracity. It seems the time for him to put his cards on the table and end the speculation and parlour-game guessing is rapidly approaching. In fact it's past time, if you ask some Democrats. The intelligence committee of the House of Representatives will investigate the claims, says its new chairman, Adam Schiff.He said the allegations against Mr Trump,externalwere ""among the most serious to date"". The head of the House judiciary committee, Jerrold Nadler, said it would also work to ""get to the bottom"" of the case. Some Democrats reacted by calling for impeachment. This video can not be played How the jailing of Cohen affects Trump Representative Ted Lieu tweeted,externalthat the story established a ""clear case of Obstruction of Justice, a felony"". Representative for Texas Joaquin Castro,externalsaid that if the story were true ""President Trump must resign or be impeached"". The president's response on Twitter,externalmainly retweeted a Fox News reporter's comment that Cohen had been ""convicted of perjury and fraud"", though the president added ""Lying to reduce his jail time!"" The president's current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, issued a statement on Friday saying that ""any suggestion from any source that the president counselled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false"". Earlier, Mr Giuliani told the Washington Post,external: ""If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge."" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News it was ""ludicrous"" to give credibility to Buzzfeed, saying its ""uncorroborated"" story was the kind of fake news the president and his team had to deal with daily. He said that Cohen had been ""proven to be a liar"". Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. It is up to the attorney general to notify Congress and decide whether the report will be released publicly. Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? President Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is currently undergoing confirmation in Congress. He has said he will make as much of the Mueller report public as possible but has not promised to publish it all. Cohen was sentenced in New York last month So far Mr Mueller's investigation has led to charges against more than two dozen Russians, as well as several people connected to Mr Trump himself, including his former national security adviser and the former chairman of his election campaign. A number of them, including Cohen, are known to be co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. How could the president be impeached? How will history judge President Trump? Cohen's help to Russia probe revealed Cohen must report to prison by 6 March, but before that, he has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in February.

"This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? Coventry City Council has the longest response time in Britain for filling in serious potholes, new research has revealed. Figures released by motoring charity the RAC Foundation show the authority aims to make road repairs within five working days. Cumbria, Flintshire and South Lanarkshire councils try to act ""immediately"" to sort out defects. Coventry City Council said it had a ""good track record on road repairs"". Information on its ""five working day response"" also appears on the council's website - but the authority told the BBC they would visit potholes which pose a ""danger"" within two hours. The figures are based on Freedom of Information (FOI) data provided by about 190 of the 207 local highway authorities in Britain. According to the research, Harrow Council has a target repair time of half an hour, while a further 16 councils aim to patch things up within an hour. Information on Coventry City Council's website refers to repairing potholes ""within five working days"" The RAC said response times are influenced by how many miles of road a council has to manage and the size of the council area. The most common response time is two hours, with 79 local authorities looking to repair their roads within this period. RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said: ""It is understandable that large rural authorities set themselves longer response times, simply as a result of having to travel further to effect repairs, but motorists might still be surprised to see such a wide variation across the country. ""Those particularly vulnerable to potholes - cyclists and motorcyclists - might ask whether the speed of pothole investigation should be based solely on the risk to users."" Information on Coventry City Council's website refers to repairing potholes more than 40mm deep ""within five working days"". Neil Cowper, head of highways for Coventry City Council, said ""where a pothole is a danger to pedestrians and other traffic users we act as soon as we can get officers to the site, usually within two hours"". He added: ""There have been many cases where, on investigation, a pothole has been coned off immediately and an officer has stayed on site to ensure that the area is made safe."" Potholes daubed with provocative art 'People don't realise the threat potholes pose' Extra Â£420m to tackle potholes in England Mr Cowper said the council also had ""a team of inspectors who monitor our roads and pavements and they respond quickly to reports of serious defects"". The council also questioned the wording of the FOI request and how the RAC compiled their statistics. The RAC said they found local highway authorities adopted a ""risk-based approach"" to fixing road defects with the volume of traffic and mix of road users taken into account when deciding how quickly to act. Almost all authorities set minimum sizes for potholes before they will take action, which vary from 20 to 30mm deep at 37 councils to at least 50mm at 26 others. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said: ""Keeping roads safe for all users is one of the most important jobs councils do and is reflected in the fact that local authorities are fixing a pothole every 21 seconds, with priority given to repairing potholes that pose the greatest risk based on their size and location, as recognised in this report."" He added that councils need ""consistent and fairer government investment in local road maintenance"".

"Supply shortages and rising prices for some medicines are being reported by pharmacists and GPs. The possibility of a no-deal Brexit is being blamed. So what is going on in the pharmaceutical world and what might it mean for patients? There is nothing new about occasional shortages of certain types of medicine. But there are reports of more acute problems than usual and some are citing a market reaction to the risk of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal. Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit Six key questions Brexit poses for the NHS Brexit: NHS managers warn about impact of no deal The organisation that negotiates drug pricing on behalf of pharmacies told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money that Brexit is already affecting the supply and price of some key generic drugs. The programme was contacted by a patient unable to obtain the usual anti-inflammatory for her arthritis who was told she had to have a substitute because of shortages. Simon Dukes, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), said there were supply shortages for a number of reasons and that ""concerns around a no-deal Brexit are likely to exacerbate those ongoing issues"". In a letter to the Health Select Committee he referred to recent price rises, saying: ""The surge may be due to a combination of factors including Brexit planning and contingency."" The medicines market is complex. The big pharma companies market their own-brand drugs and the overall cost to the NHS is capped each year. Once a patent expires, drugs become ""generic"" which means that any manufacturer and distributor can make and sell them. The prices of these generic medicines rise and fall in a market which can be opaque. Pharmacists have to pay the going rate and claim back from the NHS according to an agreed tariff but sometimes that tariff doesn't keep up with market moves and that leaves pharmacies out of pocket. It is the price and supply of these generics which have caused concern amongst pharmacies. Their cash flow comes under severe pressure if the extra costs of the generic drugs are not covered quickly by the NHS. Sometimes wholesalers cannot immediately replenish supplies at pharmacies and that means disappointment for GPs and patients. Stockpiling is a vexed issue. The government has told manufacturers of both branded and generic drugs to ensure that six weeks' worth of supplies have been built up to ensure continuity in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This exercise has been largely successful. Hospitals and patients have been told not to build up their own private supplies. But the PSNC suspects that there is unofficial stockpiling of generic drugs somewhere in the medicines supply chain. A combination of that and distributors possibly raising prices in anticipation of there being no deal are factors in the recent market moves. Pharmacists report difficulties obtaining some drugs In response to the BBC Radio 5 Live story, there have been tweets from GPs, pharmacists and patients pointing to difficulties obtaining certain drugs. There is clearly a feeling that these problems go beyond the occasional supply issues seen in the system. The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC: ""Our number one priority is to ensure the continued supply of medicines and we work closely with industry and partners in the health system to help prevent disruption. ""The department has well-established processes to manage and mitigate the small number of supply problems that may arise at any one time due to manufacturing or distribution issues."" The British Generic Manufacturers Association denied there had been a ""surge"" in prices and said global market forces as well as Brexit were at play. The association added: ""We are working with the government, in the same forums as the PSNC, to ensure that patients can continue to receive their medicines in the case of a no-deal Brexit. ""If all in the supply chain are following the government's advice and not hoarding supplies of medicines, this should have no impact on current prices."" The government's line is that contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit are in place, including chartering aircraft to bring in drugs with a short shelf-life. But there are concerns in the health world as the UK's departure from the EU draws nearer. Some question whether a six-week official stockpile is enough.  Others point to the recent price rises of generic drugs as a pointer to what might happen in the event of a disorderly Brexit.

"This video can not be played Witness Roy Warne: ""There was a huge collision"" A crash involving the Duke of Edinburgh on a notorious A-road has highlighted road safety, a meeting has heard. Prince Philip, 97, escaped unhurt after his Land Rover overturned near the Queen's Sandringham estate on Thursday. It happened a day before Norfolk councillors agreed to cut the speed limit on the A149, where there have been five deaths in six years. Councillor Colleen Walker said the duke's involvement had brought the issue ""right to the forefront"". The Labour councillor told the county's transport committee drivers often raced along the road, with its ""blind corners and little bends"". She and her fellow members approved proposals to drop the speed limit from 60mph to 50mph and install average speed cameras along the A149. Prince Philip, 97, regularly drives in the Sandringham area The meeting was told there had been 40 accidents resulting in injury since 2012, including five deaths. The proportion of those accidents resulting in death or serious injury was ""almost double the national average"",said the report,externalbefore councillors. Speaking afterwards, Ms Walker said the A149 had been discussed at ""virtually every meeting"" of the committee but the topic had been ""pushed to the side"". ""I think the fact that it was the Duke of Edinburgh involved yesterday, it has brought this right to the forefront, and I think we will now see some speedy work done,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say it was an accident waiting to happen, but it is something we have highlighted previously. ""Unfortunately it was who it was, and I hate to say this, but if it hadn't have been him would we be discussing this today?"" Damage to the Land Rover's left side could be seen after the crash The meeting was arranged before the duke's crash, in which two women in a Kia suffered minor injuries. They were taken to a hospital while a nine-month boy in the car was uninjured. Committee chairman Martin Wilby sent ""extreme sympathy"" to those involved. Norfolk's Police and Crime Commissioner, Lorne Green, who lives in nearby Snettisham, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that he had been travelling on the road for ""40 years on and off"" and had ""seen a tremendous build up of traffic"", especially where it meets with Station Road and Beach Road, about 10 minutes from the crash site. ""I really feel that I am taking my life into my hands whenever I have to cross the road at that junction,"" he said. Debris at the scene where Prince Philip was involved in a traffic accident Norfolk's former roads policing chief said Prince Philip would be treated ""like any other driver"" by police. Retired chief inspector Chris Spinks, who led the county's traffic team for five years, said the force would be treating the crash as ""critical incident"" due to the global interest in the case. The status is used for investigations where public safety or the force's reputation is at stake and will mean scrutiny from senior officers ""to ensure nothing is missed"", he said He said officers would be likely to follow-up on first-hand accounts by interviewing those involved, including Prince Philip, the day after the crash. ""If I was in my old job I would want an eye on what's going on, because there are reputational issues for Norfolk Constabulary if it's not handled properly,"" he said. As an older driver, the duke's eyesight and fitness to drive could also be investigated, said Mr Spinks, who added there would be ""no favouritism"". ""In terms of process he will be dealt with like any other driver. ""Dealing with someone from the Royal Family is only different in that you probably can't pick up the phone to talk to them,"" he said. Witnesses said the duke was ""conscious but very, very shocked and shaken"" as he was helped out of the vehicle. A man who helped to free him from the crash said he saw the Land Rover ""careering"" across the road. Norfolk Police said the two women involved in the crash - aged 28 and 45 - have since been discharged from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. The driver suffered cuts, while the passenger sustained an arm injury, police said. The force said it would be ""inappropriate to speculate on the causes of the collision until an investigation is carried out"". Is age a factor behind the wheel? Duke's car 'careered' across road People helped at crash scene, witness says There were 40 crashes - five of which were fatal - on the A149, which is the main route along the Norfolk coast, in the six years from 2012-2018. A council report recommended lowering the speed limit and installing average speed cameras along the road between the Knights Hill roundabout and Snettisham - an idea originally proposed in 2015. The average speed camera system will cover the A149 from the junction with the A148, about two and a half miles south of the crash scene, to Snettisham, six miles to the north. Residents have previously raised concerns about a number of junctions along the A149, which is used by more than 15,000 vehicles a day. This video can not be played The BBC's Nicholas Witchell says the duke regularly drives in the Sandringham area Prince Phillip is back at Sandringham, where he has been staying with the Queen since Christmas, and has seen a doctor as a precaution. The force said it was standard policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. A woman who drove past the crash scene said she saw an ambulance and ""a heavy police presence"". She added: ""I saw a black, 4x4 type car on its side and me and my son were like 'oh my word, that doesn't look good'. ""Obviously it looked quite smashed in. I'm quite amazed he [the duke] is OK actually."" Prince Philip retired from public life in August 2017having spent decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. He did not attend the Royal Family's Christmas Day service at Sandringham last month.

"The racial slur was allegedly used during a Christmas party held at the Cutler's Hall in Sheffield The husband of a senior police officer responsible for tackling hate crimes has been questioned over allegations he racially abused a woman. Ex-police officer Ian Barber allegedly used a racial slur to a waitress at a police Christmas party in Sheffield. Mr Barber is married to Rachel Barber, deputy chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police and the force's lead on hate crimes. South Yorkshire Police said an investigation was ongoing. The incident is alleged to have happened at a Christmas party for senior officers from South Yorkshire Police at Cutler's Hall in Sheffield on 15 December. Mr Barber and his wife are both former officers with the force. BBC News has been told Mr Barber twice clashed with members of the waiting staff at the venue during the course of the evening. He is alleged to have used a racially abusive comment during the course of the second argument. A senior officer from South Yorkshire Police, Assistant Chief Constable Tim Forber, is said to have intervened and asked Mr Barber to leave. Both Ian and Rachel Barber have served with South Yorkshire Police In a statement, South Yorkshire Police said an investigation had been launched and ""inquiries remain ongoing"". The force added: ""A member of staff reported they were subject to a racially abusive comment, as soon as this was highlighted to those at the event, a man, who was a guest at the event and is not a SYP employee, was asked to leave immediately. ""A man has since voluntarily attended a police station in relation to this matter."" Nottinghamshire Police said it would be ""inappropriate for us to comment"" as there was a live police investigation under way. The venue also declined to comment. BBC News has not been able to contact either Mr or Mrs Barber for comment as they are understood to be on holiday. Intimidating behaviour and unwanted sexual advances are also seen as misogyny hate crime Rachel Barber is Nottinghamshire Police's strategic lead for hate crime. She said, in 2016, ""behaviour which intimidates, threatens, humiliates or targets women is completely unacceptable"". She added that the force would ""seek prosecutions where these are appropriate"". Nottinghamshire Police expanded its hate crime categoriesto include misogynistic incidents that year and have piloted it since. It means abuse or harassment which might not be a crime can be reported to and investigated by the police, and support for the victim put in place.

"Sandra Bullock's character battles impossible odds throughout Bird Box Shows including Bird Box helped Netflix end 2018 with more than 139 million subscribers, adding 8.8 million members in the last three months of the year. The streaming giant said the growth reflected the success of its original programmes. Netflix-original material now represents the ""vast majority"" of its most popular shows, executives said. Television viewers in the US also spend an estimated 10% of their time on Netflix, they claimed. The figures accompanied the release of the firm's quarterly earnings report on Thursday. What's behind the success of Netflix's latest releases? Sleepless nights over Sandra Bullock's blindfold They offered investors a rare glimpse of audience viewing patterns, as the firm seeks to explain how its massive spending on content - much of it funded with debt - is paying off. The company released details of some of its most popular shows: Bird Box was watched by 80 million households in its first four weeks after release Spanish drama Elite was watched 20 million households in its first four weeks after release Netflix estimates that You and Sex Education will both be watched by 40 million households within their first four weeks of release Analysts estimate that Netflix spent more than $13bn on movies and shows this year. Netflix said its spending is likely to increase. ""Our multi-year plan is to keep significantly growing our content while increasing our revenue faster to expand our operating margins,"" Netflix said in a shareholder letter tied to the earnings report. ""Our growth is based on how good our experience is,"" it said. Netflix recently renewed Narcos: Mexico for a second season Shares, which had risen sharply in recent weeks, dipped more than 3% in after-hours trade, after revenue for the fourth quarter fell shy of analyst expectations. The firm reported quarterly revenue of $4.2bn (Â£3.2bn), up 27% from the same period in 2017. However, a price increase in the US and some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean announced this week has the potential to add some $1bn in revenue. The firm said it will also look to adjust prices elsewhere as currencies fluctuate, but warned the increases could lag behind the exchange rate shifts, causing revenue hiccoughs. George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said he expected Netflix subscribers to swallow the higher fees. The 8.8 million rise in paid subscribers - most of them from overseas - marked 6% growth from the prior quarter. He added: ""The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren't going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers' eyeballs is only just getting started."" Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco In its letter to shareholders, there's a candid passage about where Netflix's real competition lies. It said it faces greater competition from people watching clips of video game Fortnite over those watching rival entertainment provider HBO. ""When YouTube went down global for a few minutes in October, our viewing and signups spiked for that time,"" it added. It's what makes predicting Netflix's future so interesting - they're not so much in the entertainment business, but the eyeballs business. You, the consumer, have more things than ever to look at, or interact with, and competition for Netflix will only get fiercer in 2019. In the letter, Netflix took time to big up its successes - Bird Box, which it estimates will be watched by 80 million households within four weeks of its release, and a Spanish-language exclusive, Elite, that has attracted more than 20 million. That's all positive news, but we'll learn more about the health of the company in three month's time, when we find out if consumers have a problem with Netflix's recent price hike in the US and some other countries. As for today's earnings, they are rather unremarkable: with the firm disappointing Wall Street on some measures (revenue) but outperforming expectation on others (subscriber growth).

"This video can not be played Trump's attorney general nominee William Barr is quizzed about obstruction US President Donald Trump has hit back over a news report that he directed his then personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress. Buzzfeed News said Mr Trump had instructed Cohen to lie about plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was convicted over the case last month. Mr Trump said the lawyer was lying about the Moscow project to ""reduce his jail time"". The office of US Special Counsel Robert Mueller also disputed the report. A spokesman for Mr Mueller - who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump campaign figures were complicit - said Buzzfeed's ""description of specific statements"" and ""characterisation of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate"". Democratic politicians say they will investigate Buzzfeed's allegations. Buzzfeed says its report is based on testimony from two unnamed law enforcement officials,externalinvestigating the matter. The story alleges Mr Trump received 10 personal updates from Cohen about a plan to build the Moscow tower at a time when Mr Trump denied having any business ties to Russia. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was All you need to know about Trump Russia story Seven legal headaches for the president Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and son, Donald Jnr, were also updated, the story alleges. Mr Mueller has already revealed that Cohen lied about the date the Moscow Trump Tower project ended. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Cohen told Congress talks over the plan had taken place between September 2015 and January 2016 but criminal complaint documents say they lasted until June. Cohen said the plan had been halted earlier in an attempt to ""minimise links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1"" during the election campaign. Individual 1 has previously been identified by Cohen as Mr Trump. Buzzfeed says Cohen has told investigators that Mr Trump ""personally instructed him to lie"" about the date negotiations ended ""in order to obscure Trump's involvement"" The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at The report said Mr Mueller had other evidence, including from interviews with other Trump organisation staff and internal company emails, to corroborate Cohen's version of events. The report also says Mr Trump allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Cohen was sentenced to 36 months in December after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress over the Trump Tower plan. He also admitted campaign finance violations and tax evasion. In court he said his ""weakness was a blind loyalty to Donald Trump"" - whose ""dirty deeds"" he had felt compelled to cover up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News With the longest government shutdown in history poised to stretch into a fifth week, Washington has become a political powder keg. The report on Thursday night that there is documentary evidence Donald Trump directed his former attorney to lie to Congress just lit a big fuse. If the Buzzfeed story is substantiated - and it asserts this evidence is already in the hands of Mr Mueller - this would appear to present a strong case for presidential obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, in a hearing on Tuesday, prompted attorney general nominee William Barr to acknowledge as much. Already the quiet whispers of impeachment among House Democrats are getting louder. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been able to tamp down this sentiment so far, but she may be unable - or unwilling - to keep it under wraps much longer. For almost two years, Mr Mueller's Russia investigation has been a cipher, with details of its activities coming only in opaque legal filings and anonymous accounts of unascertainable veracity. It seems the time for him to put his cards on the table and end the speculation and parlour-game guessing is rapidly approaching. In fact it's past time, if you ask some Democrats. The intelligence committee of the House of Representatives will investigate the claims, says its new chairman, Adam Schiff.He said the allegations against Mr Trump,externalwere ""among the most serious to date"". The head of the House judiciary committee, Jerrold Nadler, said it would also work to ""get to the bottom"" of the case. Some Democrats reacted by calling for impeachment. This video can not be played How the jailing of Cohen affects Trump Representative Ted Lieu tweeted,externalthat the story established a ""clear case of Obstruction of Justice, a felony"". Representative for Texas Joaquin Castro,externalsaid that if the story were true ""President Trump must resign or be impeached"". The president's response on Twitter,externalmainly retweeted a Fox News reporter's comment that Cohen had been ""convicted of perjury and fraud"", though the president added ""Lying to reduce his jail time!"" The president's current personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, issued a statement on Friday saying that ""any suggestion from any source that the president counselled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false"". Earlier, Mr Giuliani told the Washington Post,external: ""If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge."" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News it was ""ludicrous"" to give credibility to Buzzfeed, saying its ""uncorroborated"" story was the kind of fake news the president and his team had to deal with daily. He said that Cohen had been ""proven to be a liar"". Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. It is up to the attorney general to notify Congress and decide whether the report will be released publicly. Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe Michael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer What does the special counsel do? President Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is currently undergoing confirmation in Congress. He has said he will make as much of the Mueller report public as possible but has not promised to publish it all. Cohen was sentenced in New York last month So far Mr Mueller's investigation has led to charges against more than two dozen Russians, as well as several people connected to Mr Trump himself, including his former national security adviser and the former chairman of his election campaign. A number of them, including Cohen, are known to be co-operating with Mr Mueller's inquiry. How could the president be impeached? How will history judge President Trump? Cohen's help to Russia probe revealed Cohen must report to prison by 6 March, but before that, he has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in February.

"Kim Yong-chol has emerged as North Korea's lead negotiator in talks with the US One of North Korea's top negotiators is in Washington to meet US officials ahead of a possible second summit between the two countries' leaders. Kim Yong-chol is meeting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and could hold talks with President Donald Trump at the White House later, US media say. He reportedly has another letter from leader Kim Jong-un to Mr Trump. Little progress has been made on North Korean de-nuclearisation since their historic summit in Singapore last June. Speculation is mounting that a second meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump could be held in Vietnam. The North Korean leader is scheduled to travel to the communist-run country for an ""official state visit"" sometime in February, Reuters news agency reports, citing unnamed sources. Kim Yong-chol: Kim Jong-un's right hand man North Korea's breakdown of communication There has recently been a flurry of diplomatic activity.Kim Jong-un visited China earlier this monthfor talks with President Xi Jinping, as he did before the Singapore summit. Meanwhile, another senior North Korean official, vice-foreign minister Choe Son-hui, took part in talks in Sweden. Gen Kim, a former spymaster often referred to as Kim Jong-un's right-hand man, has emerged as North Korea's lead negotiator in recent talks with the US. He is a controversial figure and was accused of masterminding attacks on South Korean warships during his time as military intelligence chief in 2010. He last visited Washington in June, when he delivered a letter to Mr Trump ahead of historic talks between both countries. Video: Inside train used by Kim on China visit N Korea ambassador to Italy 'disappears' It is not clear. The last time Mr Kim went to the US, his letter to Mr Trump appeared to have helped get the Singapore summit back on track. Negotiations between both countries have stalled since then, but this meeting could be what it takes to restart talks. This video can not be played How is North Korea evading sanctions? Earlier this month, Mr Trump said that the US and North Korea were negotiating over a location for another summit but US officials have not provided any further details. The meetings in Washington could finalise plans for the summit, but just as important, analysts say, would be an understanding of what the agenda would be. Kim Jong-un warns of 'change in direction' Denuclearisation: The word Trump and Kim can't agree on Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? In his annual new year's speech a few weeks ago, Mr Kim said he was committed to denuclearisation, but warned that he would change course if US sanctions remained. Both parties signed a pledge in Singapore to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, though it was never clear what this would entail.

"Could this be the work of Banksy? A piece of graffiti found at a monorail station in Tokyo, Japan, could be the work of British artist Banksy, say local officials.

It is not clear when the work was painted but officials said they had known about it for a long time. They only realised it could be a Banksy after being contacted by residents.

"Oscar has been in hospital 57 times with his asthma Five-year-old Oscar's life has regularly hung in the balance because of severe asthma. On his second birthday, he was so ill he did not respond to any medicines, leaving his parents fearing the worst. ""I will never forget how his tiny chest rose up and down in desperate movements, trying to fill his lungs with air,"" his mum, Carla, says. After 57 emergency trips to hospital with her son, Carla is used to the routine but she never stops worrying. ""Within 30 minutes, he can go from coughing and looking OK to constantly coughing and gasping for breath... ""What we have been through, it's very distressing,"" she says. ""We've been told there's nothing else they can do for him."" Oscar is now at school which means he has to be closely supervised According to Asthma UK, it is difficult to know how many life-threatening asthma attacks happen every day in the UK, because not everyone seeks treatment for them and they can be difficult to define. But they estimate that someone in the UK has an attack every three seconds and many of those could be avoided if people heeded the warning signs and sought help quickly. This was based on asking 10,000 people with asthma to report how many attacks they had suffered in the past year. Asthma is a long-term condition which affects the airways - the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs - causing them to narrow and making it harder to breathe. It affects 4.3 million adults and 1.1 million children in the UK. Last year, 77,855 people were admitted to hospital with an asthma attack - and 1,250 died, around three people a day. Most of those are older adults, the charity says, who may not pick up the signs and ask for help. Asthma UK says you are having an asthma attack if: your blue reliever isn't helping, or you need to use it more than every four hours you're wheezing a lot, have a very tight chest, or you're coughing a lot you're breathless and find it difficult to walk or talk your breathing is getting faster and it feels like you can't get your breath in properly The charity offers health advice on its website and has emergency advice to follow when having an asthma attack - foradults,externalandchildren,external. There can be a spike in asthma attacks over winter, linked to coughs and colds It says the best way for people to stay well with asthma all year round is to take their preventer inhaler every day, so that protection in the airways is built up over time. Dr Sam Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, says: ""Asthma attacks can be really frightening but some people don't seek help, despite advice to do so. ""But people never think it's as bad as it is,"" she says. She says there can be a spike in asthma attacks over winter, linked to coughs and colds, but triggers vary from person to person, and can include pollen. In Oscar's case, the symptoms are usually obvious, to the extent that he can now tell his mum when he is having an attack. But he can deteriorate very quickly and now he is at school, the family are putting their trust in someone else spotting the signs and acting fast. The constant worry has taken its toll on everyone, including Oscar, who sees a psychologist because of the trauma of so many hospital visits and procedures. ""I'm worrying all the time,"" says Carla. ""Is the school going to ring me? Should I go out? ""We can't go on holiday abroad because we need to be near a hospital and we've lost thousands of pounds on cancelled trips because he was just too poorly to go."" But the worst feeling is helplessness, she says. ""He can be coughing all night but there is nothing you can do.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has urged Jeremy Corbyn to discuss his Brexit plans with her, after he said he would not take part in talks until ""no deal"" was ruled out. In a letter to the Labour leader, the PM wrote that ruling out no deal was an ""impossible condition"" as it was not within the government's power to do it. She has been meeting other leaders to try to find a compromise on Brexit after her deal was rejected by MPs. Earlier, Mr Corbyn dismissed the talks as a ""stunt"". The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Senior politicians on all sides have also been meeting with cabinet ministers to try to find a way forward. But Mr Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, declined to take part, telling Mrs May to ""ditch the red lines"" and ""get serious about proposals for the future"". In a speech in Hastings Mr Corbyn said: ""With no-deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phony talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring."" Mr Corbyn said the ""best outcome"" was to call a general election to ""break the deadlock"". The Labour leader has emailed Labour MPs urging them not to talk to Mrs May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. His stance has come under fire from Labour MP Mike Gapes, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, who told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Jeremy Corbyn has been quite happy in the past to talk to Hamas, Hezobollah... I find it extraordinary he's not prepared to go and meet the prime minister."" Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now Mark Urban: Is Brussels ready to give UK more time? In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I note that you have said that 'ruling out' no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government's power to rule out no deal. ""Let me explain why. Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless Parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. ""So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a Withdrawal Agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. ""I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result."" She wrote that she would be ""happy"" to discuss Mr Corbyn's proposals. On Wednesday night, speaking outside Downing Street after talks with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru, Mrs May called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"". ""It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,"" she said. Separately, Downing Street said the government has produced a ""very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold another EU referendum, which suggests it would take ""in excess of a year"". The point of the document was to ""inform the expected discussion"" Mrs May was likely to have with MPs who back another public vote, government sources say. The prime minister is holding meetings with various party leaders as well as Tory Brexiteers and the DUP - both of whom rejected her withdrawal deal earlier this week - on Thursday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay are also holding talks with senior opposition politicians, including Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that the extension of Article 50 - the two year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the talks were just ""time wasting"" if the prime minister was not prepared to consider another referendum, rule out a no-deal Brexit or to extend Article 50. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum, said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". Following her meeting on Thursday, Green MP Caroline Lucas said the PM refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take 'no deal' off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Mrs May was also resisting the option of extending Article 50, Ms Lucas said. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was in ""listening mode"" and there was optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". What does the DUP want from Brexit talks? What happens next? When asked what the government was willing to compromise on, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis refused to give specifics. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs May would not consider a customs union and that he did not believe a new referendum was ""the right way to go"". Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. Read full article. EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested that Brussels was ready to respond to any changes in Mrs May's ""red lines"", saying: ""If they change, we'll change."" He said getting an agreement was ""in everybody's interest"" and that ""something has to change"" if it is to be secured. The prime minister survived a vote of no confidence in her government by 325 to 306 votes - a margin of 19 - thanks to the backing of the 10 members of the DUP. Had they switched allegiance, the government would have lost by one vote.

This video can not be played The former prime minister tells Today leaving the EU has to be delayed Former prime minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today that an extension to Article 50 was ""inevitable"" at this point and warned a no-deal Brexit would do ""profound damage"" to the UK's economy.

Meanwhile, the SNP's Ian Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. And, in a letter published in the Times newspaper, more than 170 leading business figures called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back another referendum on withdrawal from the European Union ""to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all"". Addressing a Leave Means Leave gathering in Westminster on Thursday evening, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Brexiteers should ""prepare"" and ""organise"" for the possibility of a another referendum.

"You might have blamed the winter gloom, but if the traffic ahead of you appears a bit drab, it is because the view really is greyer than it was. Half a million of us chose to buy a grey car in 2018, making it the most popular colour for the first time, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Just over one in five new car registrations last year were grey in the UK. More than half of new cars registered were either black, grey or white. Car sales fell in 2018, so almost every shade saw a decline in the numbers of each colour sold. The exceptions were orange, which grew in popularity by 37% and beige which increased 28%. Cream was the biggest faller on the colour chart with just 559 drivers choosing it in 2018. Silver, previously a favourite, was no longer among the top five. Primary colours Broken down regionally, the trends were slightly different in Scotland, where white was the biggest seller. However in Northern Ireland and Wales grey remained popular.

"The government has been urged to speed up the publication of its guidance for a 'no deal' Brexit, after a survey of 800 businesses by the Institute of Directors found that fewer than a third of them have carried out any Brexit contingency planning. Recently, the Brexit debate has been dominated by the potential implications of the UK leaving the EU without any kind of deal in place next March. Some of the details have been pretty alarming, but the whole point about contingency planning is that it has to take account of the worst-case scenario. So what could 'no deal' mean for two essentials of daily life - food and medicines? The UK produces roughly 60% of the food it consumes. Of the remaining 40%, about three-quarters is imported directly from the European Union, including a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables like citrus fruits, grapes and lettuces. In other words, the food industry is highly dependent on just-in-time supply chains, and while the UK has more supermarkets per head than anywhere else in the world, those supermarkets keep very little in stock. It all comes in overnight, much of it through Dover. That is why the idea of gridlock at UK borders - in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit - is such a worry. Strike action which closed the port of Calais in 2015 led to queues of lorrieson the M20 in Kent stretching back for 30 miles. The logistics industry, andDover District Council,fear that the disruption caused by a 'no deal' Brexit could last for far longer. ""If there were to be no deal there would be many, many months of disruption to existing choices,"" said Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, ""frankly until some kind of deal was reached."" AstraZeneca to stockpile drugs for Brexit Reality Check: What would 'no deal' mean for aviation? Reality Check: What would a 'no deal' look like? Not a lot in public, and pressure on the government from supporters of Brexit to highlight 'no deal' planning (as a means of putting pressure on the European Union) has now been replaced by accusations that their opponents are selectively leaking scare stories. The government is planning to publish, in two tranches in late August and early September, about 70 technical notices on how businesses and consumers should prepare for no deal. I understand that about 20 of them will impact directly on the food industry. Lettuces are extremely sensitive to any disruption in the supply chain Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was reluctant to give MPs many details when he appeared before the Exiting the EU Select Committee, insisting that he wanted to wait until he could ""set it out in a responsible and full fashion"". But when Mr Raab was asked directly if the government was considering stockpiling food, he said: ""It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling. ""Of course, the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate, but we will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there is adequate food supply."" The implication that it was businesses rather than the government that should be doing any stockpiling has not gone down well within the food industry. ""If they are expecting the industry to be stockpiling things, they will be in for a surprise,"" said one executive working for a major supermarket chain. ""It's nonsense. There is absolutely no capacity in the UK supply chain for extra food to just sit around."" For one thing, you cannot stockpile perishable food. That's obvious. And a huge amount of fresh produce arrives from the EU on a daily basis. ""The problem is the government doesn't appreciate what that means in practice,"" said Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). ""For example, in the run-up to last Christmas 130 lorry-loads of citrus fruit came through Dover from Spain every single day. That's the sort of volumes we're talking."" The BRC estimates that, on average, more than 50,000 tonnes of food passes through British ports every single day from the EU. Stockpiling is simply not an option for many food retailers So border delays, caused by sudden customs and regulatory checks, could very quickly lead the distribution system to break down. For fresh produce that could mean shorter shelf lives, and rising costs in the system. Industry sources say the government has suggested that it would keep regulatory checks at borders to a minimum in the event of no deal, in an effort to keep traffic moving. But that wouldn't help much if robust checks were being carried out on the EU side. ""If there were big border hold-ups, after three days there would be gaps on the shelves in fairly short order,"" said Chris Sturman, chief executive of the Food Storage and Distribution Federation (FSDF). The trouble is there is very little spare storage capacity. According to the FSDF, there are 385 refrigerated warehouses around the country, but more than 90% of refrigerated warehousing is in constant use and margins are extremely tight. Supermarkets are certainly making contingency plans. But rather than involving stockpiling food, which one executive described as a ""non-starter"", they revolve around how they might be able to source produce from other countries if European supply chains are seriously disrupted. They have done that before. For example, bad weather in Spain last year meant lettuces were temporarily imported by air (and therefore more expensively) from Latin America, and supplies were rationed. The 2015 industrial action in Calais also promoted retailers to diversify their supply chains. But these are short-term fixes and at the moment the whole industry is trying to plan for an outcome that is impossible to predict. ""We're not going to run out of food if there is no deal,"" said Ian Wright from the FDF. ""There is a way to increase capacity, to grow more of particular vegetables, to cut out the waste that occurs at the moment. ""But the short-term disruption could be severe. The government needs to understand that."" A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the government was preparing for all eventualities but had no plans to stockpile food. ""The government has well-established ways of working with the food industry to prevent disruption - and we will be using these to support preparations for leaving the EU. Consumers will continue to have access to a range of different products."" Another big issue is medicines. Every month the UK exports 45 million packs of medicines to the EU and EEA countries, and imports more than 37 million. Again, prolonged disruption at borders could threaten supplies of drugs and other vital healthcare products - both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. There is more scope with medicines than with food to increase stocks of things like tablets, but other imported drugs such as insulin often need to be refrigerated and may therefore pose bigger logistical challenges. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons Health Select Committee recently that ""we are working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit"". ""This includes the chain of medical supplies,"" he said, ""vaccines, medical devices, clinical consumables and blood products."" Industry sources confirm that they are in close contact with the government to make sure it understands their plans, and that it knows what the practical implications of leaving without a deal could be. The UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZenecatold the BBCon 17 July that ""as a safety net"" it was increasing its drugs stockpiles across Europe by about 20% in preparation for a no-deal Brexit. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has subsequently said the company is doing everything it can to be prepared, and to make sure patients do not run out of their medicines. ""We typically run about three months of inventory for our medicines,"" he said. ""We are increasing this by one month so that we have additional inventory to protect against a disorderly Brexit, if you will."" The company is not increasing its global stock, but it is locating more of it in the UK and Europe to be available if necessary. Two other big companies, France's Sanofi and Switzerland's Novartis, have alsoconfirmed plans to increase stockpiles. But I understand that the other big UK-based pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, has decided for the moment not to increase the additional stocks of drugs that it holds in the UK. GSK was not able to say why it has taken such a decision, citing commercial confidentiality. The focus of its stocks is mostly on medicines that are not necessarily readily available from competitors or generic alternatives. GSK is certainly preparing for Brexit though. It has already started the process of moving the EU-wide marketing authorisation for more than 1,000 drugs registered in the UK to other EU countries, mostly to Germany. And GSK's annual report released in March 2018 reveals that the company is spending Â£70m in one-off costs connected to Brexit, with additional ongoing costs of up to Â£50m per year depending on what arrangements are made in the future. The UK imports more than 37 million packets of medicines each month But perhaps the biggest challenge in the health sector is faced by those who rely on products which are only of medical use for a few days or sometimes a few hours. In particular, this means radio isotopes that are essential for things like cancer scans. ""A 'no deal' scenario will be difficult for the nuclear medicine community,"" said John Buscombe, of the British Nuclear Medicine Society. ""We calculate that 60% of the radiopharmaceuticals we use come from the EU, affecting as many as 600,000 patients per year."" At the moment they arrive by road and rail across the Channel. ""If they arrive too late,"" Mr Buscombe said, ""they may not be useable because they will have decayed too much. ""They could be flown in, but that will result in increased costs that the NHS will have to pay."" When asked about the supply of medical radio isotopes by the Health Select Committee, Mr Hancock said: ""We are working with industry to ensure that exactly that sort of medicine, or rather diagnostic need, is taken care ofâ¦ it is incredibly important for me, as Secretary of State, to ensure that people will have access to the medicines they need.""

"Whether it is a no-deal Brexit or the agreement brokered by the prime minister, leaving the European Union promises to have a profound impact on patients and the wider NHS. From the staff who work on the wards and in the GP surgeries to the supply of vital medicines, there are implications. Here is a look at six key questions. The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU - although it exports even more. The port of Dover is the key supply route in and the transition arrangements mean it will remain unaffected. The key challenge will be if there is a no-deal Brexit, because there is concern of potential huge delays at the port. The government has asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of drugs to mitigate any problems if there is no deal. However, that is logistically difficult for medicines that need refrigerating, like insulin and vaccines, or those with a short shelf life, such as some cancer drugs. Supplies of radioactive materials for scans could also be hit. Contingency plans have been put in place to fly in vital treatments,  the government has said. But even the stockpiling of normal medicines is proving problematic, according to industry. Small firms in particular have reported problems stockpiling drugs because they do not have the cash flows to fund reserves of supplies. Last month, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told the Health Select Committee that he was ""very concerned"" about the prospect of a no deal, saying it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs. He even suggestedthe public may have to stockpile drugs themselves. The government has always insisted this is not needed - and could in fact make the situation worse. Only this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was telling MPs that while a no-deal scenario would be ""difficult"", he was ""confident that if everyone does everything they need to do, then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines"". The health and social care sectors are huge employers with one-and-a-half million and two million staff respectively. About 5% of the registered workforce in each area are from Europe. The Brexit agreement means all those currently working will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay. It is not clear what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The government has also indicated it will create a skilled migrants system similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. That system - known as tier two visas - allows doctors and senior nurses to be recruited from overseas. But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff such as health care assistants, porters and care workers will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least Â£30,000 a year. Nicola Sturgeon urges answers on how much Brexit will cost the NHS NHS managers warn about impact of no deal The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' There are other related factors too. The message Brexit sends to people from Europe and the weaker value of the pound, which means any money sent back to their homeland is worth less, could put off people from working in the UK. That is a point made last month by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of 36 health and care charities. It predicted Brexit could worsen the staffing shortages currently being seen in the health service. The government is more confident, arguing staff from Europe will stay and that it has a plan to ""grow its own"", with increasing numbers of doctors and nurses in training. About 27 million people in the UK have European Health Insurance Cards. They entitle the holder to state-provided medical treatment across the EU and also in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care. This will continue during the transition period, but, like much else, what happens afterwards has yet to be resolved. And if there is a no deal, the cover EHIC provides will cease to exist in theory. Attempts could be made to put reciprocal agreements in place - and given the amount of tourism into the UK from Europe it would clearly be in everyone's interest to ensure individuals are entitled to health care. Then there are the one million UK citizens who live abroad in the EU. They are currently eligible for the same health care as citizens of the EU country in which they live and they can use EHIC when they travel. The EU and UK have agreed that these people would retain their rights, but once again a no-deal Brexit could scupper that. The UK is considered a world leader in medical research, having produced around 25 of the top 100 prescription treatments. The country currently benefits from access to research funding from the EU via programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. These will continue during the transition phase, but beyond that it seems likely the UK will be treated as a third-party collaborator, meaning it will be less likely to lead programmes and will have little role in the design of them. Collaboration on rare diseases could also be put at risk. As the number of patients with rare conditions in each country is low, it is only possible to recruit enough patients for clinical trials by carrying out those trials across countries, according to the Brexit Health Alliance. Restrictions to the free movement of researchers and academics could also have an impact. Around three-quarters of UK researchers have worked abroad and currently nearly a fifth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics academics at UK institutions are from the EU. The government believes a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" is perfectly possible to deal with all these problems, given the UK is such a key player in medical and scientific research. The government is also increasing its spending on research and development. Medical research concern over Brexit Clearly, the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients it is seeing. The three key waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are being missed in every part of the UK. The public does believe migrants are a factor in this - or at least the wider demand on services. In 2017 an Ipsos opinion poll found 58% of people in the UK agreed with the view that immigration placed pressure on public services. The government's Migration Advisory Committee looked at this in the autumn. Its report,externalfound migrants were net contributors to the health service - in that they gave more than they took. That is because of the significant numbers working in the health service and the fact they were less likely to use it. The committee said this was because they tended to be young and healthy. The only exception was in maternity care, the committee said. The proportion of births to mothers from the EU has trebled in the past 15 years to one in 10. It was one of the most controversial claims of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. The prime minister has claimed this has come true. Over the summer she announced the NHS budget would increase by Â£20bn by 2023. On top of that, about Â£4bn will be given to the rest of the UK. That amounts to more than the promised Â£350m a week. Theresa May has said it will be partly paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". Although, as the UK is committed to paying into the EU budget until the end of the transition period and will also have to pay the Â£39bn divorce bill, it arguably leaves little to cover the cost of the rise. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Another way to look at it is to ask whether the NHS would have got such a rise if Brexit was not on the cards? Many think so. After all, it was long overdue. Since 2010 the NHS has been receiving between 1% to 2% extra each year - half the average rises it previously enjoyed. Who gets social care and who pays for it?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Nicholas Witchell says the Duke regularly drives in the Sandringham area The Duke of Edinburgh has been involved in a car crash while driving near the Queen's Sandringham estate, Buckingham Palace has said. Prince Philip, 97, was not injured in the accident, which happened as he drove a Land Rover out of a driveway onto the A149 shortly before 15:00 GMT. The other car involved was a Kia. Two women in it needed hospital treatment - they have since been discharged. Eyewitnesses said the duke's Land Rover overturned during the collision. They said they helped the duke out of the vehicle. He was conscious but very, very shocked and shaken, they added. Norfolk police said it was force policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. The duke is back at Sandringham and has seen a doctor as a precaution. A woman who drove past the crash scene - near Babingley, a small village north of King's Lynn in Norfolk - at around 15:40 said she saw an ambulance and ""a heavy police presence"". ""I was just going down the A149 â¦ and saw a lot of blue flashing lights ahead,"" she said. ""I saw a black, 4x4 type car on its side and me and my son were like 'oh my word, that doesn't look good'. ""Luckily it was just sort of on the side of the road, the road wasn't closed in any way. ""Obviously it looked quite smashed in. I'm quite amazed he [the duke] is okay actually."" Norfolk police confirmed officers were called to the scene shortly before 3pm after a Land Rover and a Kia were involved in a collision. It had previously been reported the duke had been driving a Range Rover. The driver of the Kia suffered cuts, while the passenger sustained an arm injury, police said. Both were treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. This video can not be played Prince Philip crash: ""People stopped to help"" - eyewitness A statement said the road remained open and both vehicles were recovered a short time later. Nick Cobb, a long-time Babingley resident, was driving past with his 16-year-old daughter Emily at about 15:10 GMT when they spotted an overturned car about 100 yards from their house. ""The [Land Rover] was on its side on a private road. ""The other car was well into the hedge on the opposite side of the road. ""There was lots of debris in the road, lots of glass and lots of other cars, some police cars, some from the Sandringham Estate and about six ordinary looking cars that looked as though they had stopped to help. Smashed glass and parts of a car left at the roadside at the scene of the crash ""We only found out that it was the duke's car when we saw it on the news. The road was not blocked by the crash and was open when we came past."" The BBC's Nic Rigby, at the scene, says all that's left are pieces of broken glass and the remnants of a wing mirror. It has been a chilly day, he adds, and there were small flurries of snow in parts of Norfolk, but nothing that troubled the county's roads. The Queen and Prince Philip have been staying at the estate in Norfolk since Christmas. The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu,tweeted a prayer,externalin support to the duke, and later another one for the two other people involved in the accident. By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond There will be several sharp intakes of breath over this accident. The first will be over the good news - that the Duke escaped unscathed. A photo of what is believed to be the accident shows what looks like a Land Rover resting on its driver side, having turned or flipped as a result of the collision. That must have been some impact. The duke was, a witness told the BBC, ""very very shocked"". But the Palace says the duke was not injured and did not need medical treatment. The duke is five months short of his 98th birthday. By anyone's standards, getting away from an accident like that unhurt is pretty impressive. There will be some surprise that the duke still drives himself on public roads. But he has always been fiercely independent, and would have resisted any suggestion that he be denied the right to drive himself. And there will now be an investigation into the circumstances of the accident. It might be that the duke is about to be persuaded to give up the wheel. Royal biographer Hugo Vickers told BBC News: ""Any kind of car accident at the age of 97 is likely to produce shock. ""Some years ago he gave up flying planes long before he needed to because he was scared that if something happened there would be a lot of criticism. ""You know, why was he, at the age of 55, still flying a plane when he should have retired at 48 or something like that. ""So he does listen to these things - he's very, very sensible. ""If anyone's involved in a car accident, it's quite a frightening thing. If he thought that he'd lost concentration or something or he hadn't seen somebody he would realise he's not up to it anymore."" The president of the AA, Edmund King said high profile car crashes involving elderly drivers often spark calls for bans or restrictions on older drivers. But he added: ""If driving restrictions based on age and safety were introduced we would be more likely to restrict young drivers rather than older drivers. ""Young, predominantly male, drivers are much more likely to crash within six months of passing their test than older drivers within six months of hanging up their keys. ""Older drivers often self restrict their driving by not driving at night and only driving on familiar roads."" The duke famously drove the Obamas when the then-US president and first lady visited Windsor in 2016. This video can not be played Prince Philip was 94 when he drove the Obamas and his wife, the Queen A discussion on whether to put average speed cameras on the stretch of the A149 where the duke's crash happenedhad already been planned,externalby Norfolk County Council on Friday - prior to the crash. Prince Philip retired from public life in August 2017having spent decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. Buckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Since retiring from official solo duties, he has appeared in public alongside the Queen and other members of the royal family at events and church services. He did not attend the Royal Family's Christmas Day service at Sandringham last month.

"Mr Trump has postponed Ms Pelosi's trip a day after she called on him to postpone his address to Congress US President Donald Trump has postponed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's upcoming trip to Brussels and Afghanistan, asking her to stay to negotiate an end to the partial US government shutdown. The president was able to halt the trip by denying the use of military aircraft to Mrs Pelosi and a delegation. On Wednesday Mrs Pelosi had urged Mr Trump to postpone his State of the Union address, amid political deadlock. Mr Trump's move came on the 27th day of the US's longest-ever federal shutdown. The Republican president wants $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) of congressional funding to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, but Democrats have refused. Mr Trump's cancellation of the trip emerged less than an hour before the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives was scheduled to leave on Thursday afternoon, US media say.

The president added that Mrs Pelosi could proceed with the trip - which he described as a ""public relations event"" - using a commercial airline. Later on Thursday the White House announced it would not send a US delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland later this month, over the shutdown. ""Out of consideration for the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay and to ensure his team can assist as needed, President Trump has cancelled his delegation's trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,"" Mrs Sanders said in a statement.

The White House had reportedly been caught flat-footed by Ms Pelosi's State of the Union announcement on Wednesday and was searching for ways to circumvent the speaker's threatened roadblock. There's still no obvious solution for them, but that hasn't kept the president from firing back. How the American public perceives this tit-for-tat is an open question. At least so far, the president appears to be shouldering the lion's share of the blame for the government shutdown. At some point, however, the governmental dysfunction could drag everyone down. Meanwhile, 800,000 federal employees continue to work - or sit at home - without pay. Government websites crash, services grind to a halt and the economic toll begins to mount. This has become a zero-sum battle where the costs of continuing to fight are matched only by the political price to be paid if a side backs down. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters Mr Trump's action ""demeans the presidency"" while Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Mrs Pelosi's threat to cancel the state of the union address ""irresponsible"" and Mr Trump's response ""also inappropriate"".

A White House aide told US media that the trip ""would have guaranteed"" that federal workers would miss their second paycheque ""because [Mrs Pelosi] would not have been here to negotiate any kind of deal"". However, Mr Trump has not banned Mrs Pelosi from going - just from using military aircraft. Later on Thursday, Melania Trump used a military plane to fly to the family's private resort in Florida ahead of the long holiday weekend, US media reported. Fox News also reports that members of Congress who were due to join the trip were left sitting on a US Air Force bus at Capitol Hill as staff at the Capitol, State, Pentagon and White House scrambled to handle the situation.

In her own letter to Mr Trump on Wednesday, Mrs Pelosi called on him to reschedule his annual address to Congress since ""the extraordinary demands presented"" by the event could not be met during the shutdown. Mr Trump has not yet directly responded to the request to move his speech, but in an email to campaign supporters, he said he was ""disinvited"" from his address to the American people.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to take up any legislation that does not have the president's approval, and has accused Democrats of wasting time.

"This video can not be played Ian Lewis says he ""needs help"" to look after the artwork The latest Banksy artwork, which appeared on the side of a garage in Port Talbot in December, has been sold privately for a ""six-figure sum"". Season's Greetings has been bought by Essex-based gallery owner John Brandler, who said he will keep the graffiti work in the town. About 20,000 people are thought to have visited the artwork in the past month. Steelworker Ian Lewis, who originally owned the artwork, said the sale was ""a weight off my shoulders"". Brandler Galleries, owned by Mr Brandler, has several works by the Bristolian artist. Mr Brandler said Season's Greetings would stay in Port Talbot for ""a minimum of two to three years"". What has happened to other Banksy works? Buyer 'willing to pay Â£100k for Banksy' ""It's where it belongs,"" he said. ""It could be the control magnet for other tourist-based opportunities in the town. Ian Lewis (left) said he was relieved to sell the Banksy artwork to John Brandler ""I have other pieces by Banksy and, depending what is discussed with the local council and the Welsh Government, I could have half a dozen Banksys on display in the town. ""Let's take it and move it into the middle of the town where the public can see it without anybody stopping them."" He said he had paid more than Â£100,000 for the artwork. Mr Brandler also praised Mr Lewis, who turned down higher offers in order to keep the work in Port Talbot. ""Ian was amazing not going for the highest price to keep it in the community,"" Mr Brandler said. ""I think an awful lot of people would have taken the money and run, but he wasn't selfish and he deserves recognition for that."" Banksy sale raises Â£400k for club Banksy confirms new 'snow' artwork is his Mr Lewis, 55, who found the mural on his garage one week before Christmas, said the whole experience had been ""life changing"". He said: ""I think the town has fallen in love with it, I think everybody loves it and it would have been a shame for it to move from the area. ""There were lots of offers, lots of options of what people wanted to do with it. There were art collectors, dealers, people who wanted to take it away basically."" Volunteers estimate more than 20,000 people have visited the Banksy ""The artwork is going to be moved and I'll rebuild the garage. I think that every graffiti artist in the area is going to come down and have a go at it now though, although I don't think Banksy will be back again,"" Mr Lewis added. ""I'm still thinking about what to do. Now the stress has been lifted off me I should have more time to think about what I really want to do. I'm planning to stay here, maybe a few little holidays, but I'm going to stay in Port Talbot. ""Personally I think it was an ideal spot for the theme of the artwork. I don't think it was anything to do with me, just the garage."" The Welsh Government offered to take on security arrangements while Mr Lewis considered his options and actor Michael Sheen contributed to some of the costs of security.

"This video can not be played Theresa May has called on MPs to ""work constructively together"" to find a way forward Theresa May has urged Jeremy Corbyn to discuss his Brexit plans with her, after he said he would not take part in talks until ""no deal"" was ruled out. In a letter to the Labour leader, the PM wrote that ruling out no deal was an ""impossible condition"" as it was not within the government's power to do it. She has been meeting other leaders to try to find a compromise on Brexit after her deal was rejected by MPs. Earlier, Mr Corbyn dismissed the talks as a ""stunt"". The PM will publish a new plan on Monday with a full debate and key vote scheduled for Tuesday, 29 January. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Brexit: A really simple guide Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now May's government survives no confidence vote No confidence motion: How did my MP vote? Senior politicians on all sides have also been meeting with cabinet ministers to try to find a way forward. But Mr Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, declined to take part, telling Mrs May to ""ditch the red lines"" and ""get serious about proposals for the future"". In a speech in Hastings Mr Corbyn said: ""With no-deal on the table, the prime minister will enter into phony talks just to run down the clock and try to blackmail MPs to vote through her botched deal on a second attempt by threatening the country with the chaos that no-deal would bring."" Mr Corbyn said the ""best outcome"" was to call a general election to ""break the deadlock"". The Labour leader has emailed Labour MPs urging them not to talk to Mrs May until she has ruled out a no-deal Brexit. His stance has come under fire from Labour MP Mike Gapes, a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn, who told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Jeremy Corbyn has been quite happy in the past to talk to Hamas, Hezobollah... I find it extraordinary he's not prepared to go and meet the prime minister."" Corbyn tells May: Rule out no-deal now Mark Urban: Is Brussels ready to give UK more time? In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I note that you have said that 'ruling out' no deal is a precondition before we can meet, but that is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government's power to rule out no deal. ""Let me explain why. Under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and the Withdrawal Act 2018, we will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March unless Parliament either agrees a deal with the EU or the UK revokes article 50 and chooses to stay in the EU permanently. ""So there are two way to avoid no deal: either vote for a deal, in particular a Withdrawal Agreement, that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result. ""I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result."" She wrote that she would be ""happy"" to discuss Mr Corbyn's proposals. On Wednesday night, speaking outside Downing Street after talks with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru, Mrs May called on MPs to ""put self-interest aside"". ""It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done,"" she said. Separately, Downing Street said the government has produced a ""very short paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold another EU referendum, which suggests it would take ""in excess of a year"". The point of the document was to ""inform the expected discussion"" Mrs May was likely to have with MPs who back another public vote, government sources say. The prime minister is holding meetings with various party leaders as well as Tory Brexiteers and the DUP - both of whom rejected her withdrawal deal earlier this week - on Thursday. Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay are also holding talks with senior opposition politicians, including Labour MPs Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.

The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said that the extension of Article 50 - the two year mechanism that means the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - the ruling out of a no-deal Brexit, and the option of a second EU referendum would have to form the basis of future discussions. Party leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the talks were just ""time wasting"" if the prime minister was not prepared to consider another referendum, rule out a no-deal Brexit or to extend Article 50. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said they were ""committed to finding a real solution"" but ""that means taking a no deal Brexit off the table and a People's Vote on our European future"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum, said he was encouraged by Mrs May's ""willingness to talk about these issues in detail"". Following her meeting on Thursday, Green MP Caroline Lucas said the PM refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. ""I repeatedly urged her again and again to take 'no deal' off the table because I think it completely skews the talks because you know that cliff edge is there,"" she said. Mrs May was also resisting the option of extending Article 50, Ms Lucas said. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister was in ""listening mode"" and there was optimism that a Brexit deal could still be reached. She said she made a ""clear ask"" in relation to the Irish backstop, urging Mrs May to address it ""in a satisfactory way"". What does the DUP want from Brexit talks? What happens next? When asked what the government was willing to compromise on, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis refused to give specifics. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mrs May would not consider a customs union and that he did not believe a new referendum was ""the right way to go"". Meetings, on their own, are not a Plan B. Conversations, are not by themselves, compromises. To get any deal done where there are such clashing views all around, it requires give and take. It feels like a political lifetime since there has been a fundamental dispute in the cabinet, in the Tory party and across Parliament. Theresa May has stubbornly, although understandably, tried to plot a middle course. But that has failed so spectacularly at this stage. Ultimately she may well be left with the same dilemma of which way to tack. Read full article. EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has suggested that Brussels was ready to respond to any changes in Mrs May's ""red lines"", saying: ""If they change, we'll change."" He said getting an agreement was ""in everybody's interest"" and that ""something has to change"" if it is to be secured. The prime minister survived a vote of no confidence in her government by 325 to 306 votes - a margin of 19 - thanks to the backing of the 10 members of the DUP. Had they switched allegiance, the government would have lost by one vote.

This came after MPs voted against Mrs May's plans for Brexit on Tuesday night by a historic margin when it was rejected by 230 votes -the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. This video can not be played The former prime minister tells Today leaving the EU has to be delayed Former prime minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today that an extension to Article 50 was ""inevitable"" at this point and warned a no-deal Brexit would do ""profound damage"" to the UK's economy.

This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The government must remove the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit"" The Times newspaper,externalclaimed Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom and other cabinet Brexiteers want Mrs May to present MPs with a ""Plan B"" on Monday that would include a promise to impose a time-limit on the Northern Irish backstop - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - and to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal.

Alternative ways to break Brexit deadlock No-deal Brexit warning for UK drivers And the Telegraph reportedit had seen a leaked transcript of a conference call,externalin which Chancellor Philip Hammond told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be ""taken off the table"". Meanwhile, the SNP's Ian Blackford has also written to Mr Corbyn, along with other opposition leaders, to urge him to back another referendum as Labour's official position. And, in a letter published in the Times newspaper, more than 170 leading business figures called for Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to back another referendum on withdrawal from the European Union ""to stop us crashing out of the EU with no deal at all"". Addressing a Leave Means Leave gathering in Westminster on Thursday evening, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Brexiteers should ""prepare"" and ""organise"" for the possibility of a another referendum.

"This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? Coventry City Council has the longest response time in Britain for filling in serious potholes, new research has revealed. Figures released by motoring charity the RAC Foundation show the authority aims to make road repairs within five working days. Cumbria, Flintshire and South Lanarkshire councils try to act ""immediately"" to sort out defects. Coventry City Council said it had a ""good track record on road repairs"". Information on its ""five working day response"" also appears on the council's website - but the authority told the BBC they would visit potholes which pose a ""danger"" within two hours. The figures are based on Freedom of Information (FOI) data provided by about 190 of the 207 local highway authorities in Britain. According to the research, Harrow Council has a target repair time of half an hour, while a further 16 councils aim to patch things up within an hour. Information on Coventry City Council's website refers to repairing potholes ""within five working days"" The RAC said response times are influenced by how many miles of road a council has to manage and the size of the council area. The most common response time is two hours, with 79 local authorities looking to repair their roads within this period. RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said: ""It is understandable that large rural authorities set themselves longer response times, simply as a result of having to travel further to effect repairs, but motorists might still be surprised to see such a wide variation across the country. ""Those particularly vulnerable to potholes - cyclists and motorcyclists - might ask whether the speed of pothole investigation should be based solely on the risk to users."" Information on Coventry City Council's website refers to repairing potholes more than 40mm deep ""within five working days"". Neil Cowper, head of highways for Coventry City Council, said ""where a pothole is a danger to pedestrians and other traffic users we act as soon as we can get officers to the site, usually within two hours"". He added: ""There have been many cases where, on investigation, a pothole has been coned off immediately and an officer has stayed on site to ensure that the area is made safe."" Potholes daubed with provocative art 'People don't realise the threat potholes pose' Extra Â£420m to tackle potholes in England Mr Cowper said the council also had ""a team of inspectors who monitor our roads and pavements and they respond quickly to reports of serious defects"". The council also questioned the wording of the FOI request and how the RAC compiled their statistics. The RAC said they found local highway authorities adopted a ""risk-based approach"" to fixing road defects with the volume of traffic and mix of road users taken into account when deciding how quickly to act. Almost all authorities set minimum sizes for potholes before they will take action, which vary from 20 to 30mm deep at 37 councils to at least 50mm at 26 others. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said: ""Keeping roads safe for all users is one of the most important jobs councils do and is reflected in the fact that local authorities are fixing a pothole every 21 seconds, with priority given to repairing potholes that pose the greatest risk based on their size and location, as recognised in this report."" He added that councils need ""consistent and fairer government investment in local road maintenance"".

"You might have blamed the winter gloom, but if the traffic ahead of you appears a bit drab, it is because the view really is greyer than it was. Half a million of us chose to buy a grey car in 2018, making it the most popular colour for the first time, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Just over one in five new car registrations last year were grey in the UK. More than half of new cars registered were either black, grey or white. Car sales fell in 2018, so almost every shade saw a decline in the numbers of each colour sold. The exceptions were orange, which grew in popularity by 37% and beige which increased 28%. Cream was the biggest faller on the colour chart with just 559 drivers choosing it in 2018. Silver, previously a favourite, was no longer among the top five. Primary colours Broken down regionally, the trends were slightly different in Scotland, where white was the biggest seller. However in Northern Ireland and Wales grey remained popular.
