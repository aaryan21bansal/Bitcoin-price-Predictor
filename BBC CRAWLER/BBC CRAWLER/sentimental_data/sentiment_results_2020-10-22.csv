"Playa De Las Teresitas in Tenerife UK tourists seeking winter sun have been given a boost, after Spain's Canary Islands and the Maldives were added to the government's safe travel list. It means visitors will no longer need to quarantine for 14 days on their return, with the Greek island of Mykonos and Denmark also deemed safe. The changes apply to anyone arriving in the UK after 04:00 BST on Sunday. But Liechtenstein has been taken off the list, so arrivals must isolate. The changes apply to citizens from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The Canary Islands are popular with winter holidaymakers, being one of the few parts of Europe warm enough for beach holidays at that time. However, the rest of Spain, including the Balearic Islands, remain subject to quarantine restrictions amid a surge in infections. Beyond having to fill in passenger locator forms, visitors to the Canaries and Mykonos currently face no restrictions to entry. Which countries can I still go on holiday to? First UK airport coronavirus testing begins But all visitors to the Maldives are required to prove they have had a negative Covid test within 96 hours of arrival. And any UK citizen visiting Denmark must prove they have a""worthy purpose"" for visiting,external, such as work or study, as Denmark deems Britain to be a high risk country. Tourism is not considered a worthy purpose, although people with second homes in the country may visit. The Department for Transport said the new additions to the safe list had seen a decrease in confirmed cases of coronavirus. However, it said ""a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Liechtenstein"" had led to it being removed from the current list of ""travel corridors"". After so much doom and gloom, travel companies can suddenly see the sunshine. The Canaries are a key destination for UK airlines and tour operators. And it is not an exaggeration to say that the removal of the quarantine will help these companies make it through the winter. The government has, in effect, dialled-up the tourism ""on switch"". However it will be a real test case for whether, in these uncertain Covid times, there is demand for travel. With plenty of time for people to make winter bookings it's a timely moment. British Airways recently scheduled a direct flight to the Maldives, so maybe they knew something we didn't. Travel companies, which have seen demand slump due to the quarantine rules, welcomed the decision on the Canaries. ""The Canaries are a hugely important market for winter travel - representing over 50% of bookings for some tour operators - so this is very welcome news for the whole sector,"" said industry body Airlines UK. Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI, said the holiday operator had not been able to take people on a holiday to the Canaries for 89 days. ""We're therefore delighted that UK flights will now resume from Saturday 24 October. The first flights will depart to Fuerteventura and Lanzarote this weekend, with many more added in the coming days."" There are now only a handful of places travellers from the UK can visit without facing restrictions - either when they arrive at their destination, or return. There are hopescoronavirus testing for passengerscould make travel to more destinations possible, by providing proof of a negative result before travellers leave the UK. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, meanwhile, has said he is""hopeful"" a new testing regime for arrivals to Britain can be in place by 1 December, reducing the amount of time people need to spend in quarantine. However, new British Airways boss Sean Doyle last week called for tests for returning Britons before departure, warning the UK would ""get left behind"" without more radical action. Earlier on Mondaythe airline cut flight numbers again, saying it would operate fewer planes than planned for the rest of the year as the pandemic continues to hit demand.

"When British TV got its first black female reporter in 1968 some viewers strongly objected and she was sacked in less than a year. Now, half a century later, a British Journalism Award has been named in her honour. Looking back, how does Barbara Blake Hannah feel about the way the country treated her? ""Too many times you buy a sandwich that you later realise had been spat in, or you're walking down the street and are spat at yourself, or best case scenario, are told '[N-word] go home.' ""But when I roamed the streets as a reporter with a camera, no-one cared that I was black. They just cared about being on TV, that's one reason why I loved the job."" Barbara Blake Hannah was 24 when she first arrived in the UK to work as an extra on the 1965 movie, A High Wind in Jamaica. And when filming finished, she and a friend decided to stay. ""Britain seemed to be opening up with opportunities at that time. I was young, living in London during the swinging 60s. It was all so exciting,"" she says. Barbara Blake Hannah (right) modelling a designer's clothes She had plenty of journalism experience from Jamaica, having read the news on TV and written for a magazine owned by her father, Evon Blake, the founder of Jamaica's Press Association. But despite this, it wasn't easy to get a job in the industry. She had to settle for temporary secretarial work ""using shorthand and typing skills from training as a journalist"", but she didn't stop applying for writing jobs, and eventually broke through. In 1966, Barbara noticed the Sunday Times magazine was running a series on food around the world, so she got in touch and offered to write something on Jamaican cooking. ""I was given a nice colourful page feature in my Jamaican costume,"" she says. This was followed by a number of other plum assignments, including interviewing the A-list entertainer Sammy Davis Jr - the only black member of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack - and Jacqueline Susann, author of a 1966 blockbuster novel, Valley of the Dolls, whom Barbara describes as ""fabulous, a real superstar, like something out of Dynasty"". Barbara also wrote for the now defunct West Indian World and Caribbean Times newspapers, and for Cosmopolitan and Queen Magazine. ""It was great to be a young journalist again. I made friends with other writers, we'd go out and about on Fleet Street. There was the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the anti-war-in-Vietnam movement, the play Hair, the Supremes, Tom Jones, Cilla Blackâ¦ It was fantastic."" A fashion reporter for a daily newspaper on Fleet St in the 1960s During the summer of 1968, Barbara heard about the launch of Thames Television. In true go-getter fashion, she wrote to them asking for a job, and was asked to audition. ""I was the most interesting, I could write a good script and I made them laugh,"" she says. Her impressive French and Spanish skills, which she'd learnt at boarding school in Jamaica, didn't go unnoticed either. She was immediately offered a contract on the daily evening show, Today, hosted by Eamonn Andrews. But a black woman reporting the news was unheard of. This was five years before the UK was introduced to ITN's first black reporter, Trevor McDonald, and more than a decade before the arrival of the BBC's Moira Stuart. Eric Anthony Abrahams (right) with Malcolm X in Oxford, December 1964 Three years before Barbara Blake Hannah began work at Thames Television, the BBC hired another Jamaican, Eric Anthony Abrahams, as a trainee reporter. By January 1966, if not earlier, he was reporting for the current affairs programme, 24 Hours; items he filed from Nigeria, Ghana, Haiti and London survive in the BBC archives. Clyde Alleyne, from Trinidad, started work as an ""announcer"" for Tyne Tees television in 1967, but also made at least three television reports.Two have been digitised by the North East Film Archive,external, including an interview with US civil rights leader Martin Luther King. The Times newspaper did a full-page spread on Barbara's debut, but she wasn't fazed. ""To me, it was just another job. I would get briefed in the newsroom, go out to film, come back to edit and be in the studio. I had already gone through the jitters of being on TV during my time in Jamaica, it was just really nice to be able to do what I enjoyed. ""I wasn't famous like Twiggy, but I guess I was known by a few. It's only nowadays I hear from people who say they or their parents watched me back then."" Barbara Blake Hannah (right) in a Biba dress, with Eamonn Andrews and fellow reporter Jane Probyn Barbara reported on it all, from crime stories to the closure of the Beatles' Baker Street shop, often called the Apple Boutique. She interviewed Sir Michael Caine, round-the-world sailor Sir Frances Chichester, and the ""great beauty"", Bianca Jagger. ""Eamonn Andrews, though he was famous, was a lovely man and genial host. My colleagues didn't treat me differently because I was black. In the office, I was just treated as another worker. It was a really great show to be on."" However, nine months into her role, Barbara's time at Thames Television came to a sudden end. Her journalistic skills and warm on-screen presence did not impress some viewers who could not see past the colour of her skin. A producer told Barbara that the station had received almost daily requests to ""get the [N-word] off the screen"", and so they did. ""It was the most hurtful thing that happened to me because I was black, and trust me, a lot of things happened to me,"" she says. ""It was almost as if I had been found to have a communicable disease. I had been so excited to get this job, and now I had to tell my friends I no longer had it, just because I was black. I hid myself in shame for a long time. ""I didn't receive any compensation, an apology, nothing. I didn't think of even asking for one, we black people weren't protected [against discrimination] in the workplace - maybe later on paper, but definitely not in the practical sense. ""But you know what, even just an apology would be nice, 50 years later."" Thames Television ceased to exist in 2003. Six months later, Barbara was hired as a reporter for ATV in Birmingham. She says she couldn't find a hotel in the city that would have her as a guest, so she commuted from London until she discovered she could stay at the YWCA. Some of her colleagues were also less than welcoming, using racial slurs to describe black people in her presence. ""They'd say things like, 'If we are all so equal, then why didn't black people create the Mona Lisa?' But I didn't speak up. I just didn't know black history and art then, like Timbuktu and Tutankhamen. ""I remember at a party, a glass cut me and I bled a little. A girl exclaimed, 'Oh look, it's red!' referring to the colour of my blood. Her friends roared with laughter. I was just so embarrassed. I wanted to hide."" Black history month: What is it and why does it matter? Clyde Best: One of the first black role models in British football What was behind the Bristol bus boycott? Ignorant and prejudiced attitudes like this seeped into the programme, Barbara says. ""I was once asked to swim a lap in a pool with one of the white reporters. I am a good swimmer, having swum in the Kingston Harbour race when I was 15, but because I was on camera that day I decided to keep my head above water, because I had straightened my hair,"" she remembers. But the position of her body in the water as she swam breast stroke with her head up - less horizontal than the body of the other reporter, who swam front crawl - was then presented as evidence supporting a theory that black people can't swim as well as white people. The report actually opened with images of her perfect strokes in the pool, and a researcher commenting: ""She's much lower in the water at the back end."" ""I was shocked,"" Barbara says. Some of Barbara's ATV reports can be watched on the website of theMedia Archive of Central England,external(search for Barbara Blake), including: The swimming report,external, where Barbara and a colleague interview an academic who thinks black children may be physiologically less capable of swimming Bad housing -Barbara visits a homeless family,externalhoused in a damp building on a former military base Barbara enjoys questioning female passers-by on the streets of Birmingham about theirproblems with poorly manufactured tights,external One of the worst moments at ATV was when she was sent out filming on a bitterly cold day, only to be told later it was because Wolverhampton MP Enoch Powell - fresh from his anti-immigration Rivers of Blood speech - had agreed to do an interview at the studio on condition that ""the black girl"" was not there. ""I was a little upset, but that was to be expected from him. He was a pretty scary man. Looking back, I wished I'd been around to ask him some very tough questions."" ATV ceased broadcasting in 1982. As health minister from 1960-1963 Enoch Powell set up recruiting centres for doctors and nurses in the Caribbean and Pakistan, but he became a vocal opponent of non-white immigration, most famouslyin his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech,external Throughout the 1960s, and afterwards,roughly 200,000 long-term international immigrants arrived in the UK each year,external Conservative and Labour governments passed laws attempting to control immigration in 1962, 1968 and 1971 At the same time, the 1965 Race Relations Act forbade discrimination on ""grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins"" in public places - in 1968 it was extended to cover discrimination in employment and housing Barbara was glad when her six-month contract came to an end. She then moved behind the scenes, working as a researcher on the BBC documentary series, Man Alive, after much encouragement from editor Desmond Wilcox during a job interview. ""It was the best job I had in TV. People were pleasant and we did some really nice stories, including a one-hour documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, which opened the door for me to go back to Jamaica."" After the documentary aired, she was asked to help promote the 1972 movie, The Harder They Come, starring reggae legend Jimmy Cliff - often described as Jamaica's first feature film. For Barbara, it seemed like the film was calling her home, and she decided to move back to Kingston later that year. ""The film blew my mind. It showed me a culture and country that I didn't know existed. The reggae and the Rasta world, which wasn't part of the life I'd experienced there before. I felt that was an opportunity for me to see a new Jamaica. The real Jamaica,"" she says. She continued working on films and attended film festivals around the world, including one in Iraq hosted by President Saddam Hussein. She also wrote books, including Rastafari - The New Creation, inspired by her new religion, and her 1982 memoir on her time in Britain, Growing Out: Black Hair and Black Pride in the Swinging Sixties. She continued reporting for Jamaican publications, and interviewed the likes of Cuban President Fidel Castro and UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson - annoying the latter with questions about Rhodesia's declaration of independence. From 1984-1987, Barbara served as the first Rastafari senator to sit in the Jamaican parliament. It was during this period that she gave birth to her only child, a son. ""He tells me every day, 'I'm so proud of you mummy.' We've had some hard times together, but we made it through."" Barbara has only visited the UK three times since 1972, for very short spells. This included a 1983 trip to make the documentary Race, Rhetoric, Rastafari for Channel 4, which explored Rastafari beliefs and race relations in England. Now 79, watching the UK from afar, she says it seems clear to her that systemic racism remains a problem. ""People still have the same attitudes,"" she says. ""Look at how shocked people were when Harry, the most loved member of the Royal Family, married a black woman."" But she was excited by the recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations, including the toppling of the Edward Colston statue by demonstrators in Bristol. ""When I saw that statue come down I thought, 'Oh my goodness!' I just had to smile and clap. I am part of a generation that was brought up to humbly obey and accept racism, so I am glad to see our next generation are not putting up with it any more."" Barbara Blake Hannah today, photographed by her son Barbara's accomplishments continue to be recognised on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2018, she was honoured with the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government for her contribution to culture. In the UK, the Press Gazette this year introduced a Barbara Blake Hannah Prize to its annual British Journalism Awards. It is to recognise emerging journalists from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds and will be awarded for the first time in December. Barbara has ensured that the winner will receive a free trip to Jamaica, if the pandemic allows. Barbara hopes the award will help address the lack of diversity in the British media. According to a 2016 Oxford University survey, only 0.2% of journalists in the UK are black, despite black people making up 3.3% of the population. If you include Asians and other ethnic minorities too, there is still a disparity, though not quite such a large one; 6.3% of journalists come from one of these backgrounds, compared with 14% in the general population. ""What happened to me 50 years ago has now turned into something that will recognise and create opportunities for young black journalists today. This is the most rewarding thing to have come out of my career. ""I want those who hear my story to know we still have a long fight ahead of us, but remember you have the same right as anyone else to be where you are. Don't allow yourself to be stereotyped. Be confident in yourself. Fight for yourself to be included."" Barbara Blake Hannah's documentaryRace, Rhetoric, Rastafari,externalcan be watched on her YouTube channel Correction and update 20 November 2020: This story originally stated that Barbara Blake Hannah was the UK's first black TV reporter, but the first now appears to have been Eric Anthony Abrahams. Information about him and Clyde Alleyne, another black broadcaster who worked in television in the 1960s, has now been added to the story. ""When I hear the word I shudder. I think of my dad hearing the words, 'Get the [N-word]!' while being chased through the streets of Liverpool by racist football fans as he went to watch Man City,"" writes Cherry Wilson.

"Demand in pubs and restaurants has collapsed after bans on households mixing were introduced in many areas The chancellor has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions after growing clamour from firms in tier two areas. Rishi Sunak announced big changes to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) - set to replace furlough in November. He told the Commons that even businesses not forced to shut were facing ""profound economic uncertainty"". Under the revised scheme, employers will pay less and staff can work fewer hours before they qualify. At the same time, the taxpayer subsidy has been doubled. At an afternoon news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the chancellor for introducing measures that ""will protect people's livelihoods"". But he warned that the UK would face ""many thousands more deaths"" if it put the economy before health. Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, had complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions. They argued that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. One prominent chef, Yotam Ottolenghi, had said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"" since tier two restrictions were applied to London, adding: ""We are on our knees now."" In response to such arguments, Mr Sunak has now changed the terms of the JSS. Referring to those businesses, he said: ""It is clear that they require further economic support."" This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules Instead of a minimum requirement of paying 55% of wages for a third of hours, as announced last month at the launch of the Winter Economic Plan, employers will have to pay for a minimum of 20% of usual hours worked, and 5% of hours not worked. The government will now fund 62% of the wages for hours not worked. This more than doubles the maximum payment to Â£1,541.75 a month. In the most generous case, the taxpayer will now go from funding 22% of wages to just under half. Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What will I be paid if work has to close? What Covid tier is my area in? The scheme will, as before, be open to all small businesses and larger businesses that can show an impact on revenues. It is aimed at addressing the gap in support for businesses in tier two restrictions, such as London and Birmingham, but is not explicitly tied to that status, and is available across the UK. Noel Hutchinson, director of Poole-based powerboat experience firm Get Lost Sailing, is one small businessman who is feeling overlooked by the new measures. His firm is in a tier one area and so is not receiving any support, but he is seeing far fewer customers as a result of the virus. ""Whether or not businesses are in tier one, two or three, they are all being massively affected by the virus,"" he says. ""A hospitality and tourism business such as ours depends on out-of-town visitors and these people are no longer travelling. Our bookings have slowed massively."" Mr Hutchinson feels that a national lockdown would serve him better, since any government support would then be distributed across the country. ""It would be better for our industry if the whole country was locked down at once and every business in receipt of a fair proportion of the support packages."" The scheme is UK-wide. However, the system of tiered restrictions in England, which gave rise to the government's newly increased economic support, is not. While England has a three-tier system, Scotland is due to bring in a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The middle three will be ""broadly equivalent"" to the English three, but the Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom and one at the top. Wales is about to enter a two-week national lockdown from 18:00 BST on Friday, while Northern Ireland began a four-week lockdown last Friday. All the devolved nations have been promised extra central government funding so they can award grants at a local level. Almost as soon as the heads of the CBI and the TUC appeared on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street to endorse last month's Winter Economic Plan, there were some doubts about its effectiveness. Business and union leaders were happy that some support for part-time working had been announced - itself a revolution for the UK - but the levels of support fell well short of German-style schemes. In particular, employers faced a hurdle of having to pay at least half of workers' wages. This was not a bug in the system - it was the strategy. The Treasury wanted the scheme to lean into a process of economic restructuring to a post-Covid ""new normal"" and not seek to prevent those changes. But all that was predicated on the pandemic being on the wane and the recovery assured. That has not proven to be the case, and indeed some had spotted that, even at the time of the original plan. This is an acknowledgement of gaps in that scheme and that large swathes of the economy are in survival, not restructure mode. For the chancellor, this is a sign that he will offer the right support at the right time. Others will say that the data was going in this direction a month ago, and that some jobs have unnecessarily been lost. Hospitality businesses gathered at a south London pizza restaurant also told the chancellor of their need for help with rents from landlords - something the Treasury thinks is far more tricky than, for example, mortgage holidays. In Greater Manchester, they will wonder why this wasn't offered to areas that were under strong social restrictions earlier. But this is a significant package worth several billion pounds, recognising the economy clearly needs support now before some inevitable fundamental changes. ""I've always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government's stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months."" Responding to his statement, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds criticised the government for what she said was a ""patchwork of poor ideas, rushed out at the last minute"". She said its approach to support for areas entering tier three had been ""nothing short of shambolic"". In other political reaction, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tweeted that the new measures had not been ""put on the table"" during negotiations with the government this week that failed to agree a Â£65m package of support. ""Honestly, can barely believe what I'm reading here,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The chancellor also announced specific help for hospitality and leisure businesses in tier two areas. English councils will be funded to give monthly grants of up to Â£2,100 to 150,000 hotels, restaurants and B&Bs. Devolved nations will be given the equivalent funding for other nations, under the Barnett Formula. The generosity of the self-employment scheme has also been doubled from 20% to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant now of Â£3,750 over a three-month period. What help are the self-employed getting from government? Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Business leaders welcomed the changes, with the CBI employers' group calling it a ""big step towards a more standardised approach"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls described it as ""a hugely generous package of support and very welcome news just when we needed it"". She said the changes to the scheme would ""help to safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs"" and give firms ""a much-enhanced chance of being able to overcome the challenges and survive into 2021"". Adam Marshall from the British Chambers of Commerce said it was a ""significant improvement"" for many struggling businesses. But he added: ""The true test of these reforms will be whether they help businesses on the ground get through the difficult months ahead."" Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, which works to improve the standard of living of low-paid workers, said Mr Sunak had done the right thing by expanding help for companies. ""Doing it earlier, given the obvious flaws, would have saved more jobs, but at least we've got to the right place 10 days ahead of the Job Support Scheme coming into effect,"" he said.

"Supermarkets will only be able to sell items like food Supermarkets will be unable to sell items like clothes during the 17-day Covid firebreak lockdown in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""made clear"" to them they are only able to open parts of their business that sell ""essential goods"". Many retailers will be forced to shut but food shops, off-licences and pharmacies can stay open when lockdown begins on Friday at 18:00 BST. Retailers said they had not been given a definition of what was essential. The Association of Convenience Stores and the Welsh Retail Consortium have written urgently to the first minister, expressing alarm over the new regulations. Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said they wanted the Welsh Government to abandon the ""essential items"" rules. ""Compelling retailers to stop selling certain items, without them being told clearly what is and what isn't permitted to be sold, is ill-conceived and short-sighted,"" she said. Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Daviestweeted,external: ""The power is going to their heads."" But Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said ""smaller businesses should not be put at an unfair disadvantage during the firebreak lockdown"". Business leaders say companies in Wales have been givenjust hoursto finalise plans for the firebreak lockdown, which ends at midnight on 9 November. Why has Wales chosen a national lockdown? Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Mr Drakeford told a Senedd committee on Friday that ""in the last lockdown, people were reasonably understanding of the fact that supermarkets didn't close all the things that they may have needed to"". ""I don't think people will be as understanding this time. ""We will make sure there is a more level playing field in those next two weeks."" Clothes shops will have to close during the lockdown The first minister was responding to Conservative Member of the Senedd Russell George, who said it was ""unfair"" to force independent clothing and hardware retailers to close while similar goods were on sale in major supermarkets. ""It felt very wrong and disproportionate to the small businesses,"" Mr George said. Mr Drakeford said: ""We will be making it clear to supermarkets that they are only able to open those parts of their business that provide essential goods to people. ""And that will not include some of the things that Russell George mentioned, which other people are prevented from selling."" There is no precise list of non-essential goods in the law coming into force on Friday, but any business selling goods or services for sale or hire in a shop will have to close. But there are exceptions for food retailers, newsagents, pharmacies and chemists, bicycle shops, petrol stations, car repair and MOT services, banks, laundrettes, post offices, pet shops and agricultural supplies shops. Under the law firms conducting a business that provides a mixed set of services will be allowed to open if they cease conducting the service that must close.

"Mr Becker appeared at Southwark Crown Court where he denied all 28 charges against him Ex-tennis champion Boris Becker has appeared in court accused of failing to hand over trophies from his playing days so they could be sold to pay debts. The three-time Wimbledon winner was declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to a bank. He is accused of not complying with obligations to disclose information. Mr Becker denied all 28 charges against him at a Southwark Crown Court hearing in London on Thursday. The 28-count indictment includes mention of his 1985 All England Club trophy, his 1989 silverware from the same tournament, and his Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996. Boris Becker was the youngest ever Wimbledon men's singles champion, aged 17 The 52-year-old German national is also accused of concealing more than Â£1m held in bank accounts, in addition to property in the UK and abroad. The court heard that he failed to declare his property interest in an address in Chelsea, south-west London, with similar charges for two properties in his home town of Leimen. Mr Becker is also accused of removing hundreds of thousands of pounds by transferring it to other accounts, including to former wife Barbara Becker, and estranged wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker. It is also alleged he hid his holding of shares in a firm called Breaking Data Corp. Mr Becker appeared to record himself on his mobile phone at Southwark Crown Court Mr Becker was released on bail ahead of his trial next September, which is set to last up to four weeks. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the retired sportsman and television presenter may face further charges at a later date. Defence counsel Jonathan Caplan said: ""He (Mr Becker) is determined to face and contest these charges and restore his reputation in relation to the allegations made against him."" The former world number one and six-time Grand Slam champion collected 49 singles titles out of 77 finals during his 16 years as a professional tennis player. He was picked to enter the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2003, and has been a commentator on the BBC and at tennis tournaments around the world.

"Durham University says such behaviour ""will not be tolerated"" Students have been left feeling ""threatened"" and unsafe after a LGBT university association Zoom meeting was ""hijacked"" by more than 15 people shouting ""homophobic slurs"". The online meeting at Durham University was disrupted with loud music, shouted abuse and ""sexually explicit videos"", say LGBT groups at the university. The event was for new students who are already facing Covid restrictions. Durham University said such behaviour ""will not be tolerated"". ""To hijack an event like this in such an aggressive and targeted way is nothing less than a hate crime,"" said a statement from LGBT groups at the university, including St Mary's College, where the incident took place earlier this month.

"Donald Trump and Joe Biden will share the stage on Thursday night for the final presidential debate before election day on 3 November. A lot is at stake. For Mr Trump - whose coronavirus diagnosis derailed plans for a debate last week - it is a chance to turn around a flagging campaign as he is currently trailing in the polls. Meanwhile, Mr Biden will work to maintain his frontrunner status, hoping to avoid any gaffes or verbal stumbles. Here's what you need to know. How the world reacted to the first presidential debate The debate will be held from 21:00-22:30 ET (02:00-03:30BST) at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and you can follow it live on this website. The 90-minute debate will have no commercial breaks. It will be divided into six 15-minute segments, with each candidate given two uninterrupted minutes before they enter into open debate. Here comes the important difference from the first debate, which was filled with interruptions: during these two-minute blocks, only the candidate who has the floor will have his microphone turned on - the other will be temporarily muted. Let's see how well that works out. The six segments will address six separate topics: Fighting Covid-19 American Families Race in America Climate Change National Security Leadership And in terms of coronavirus, safety protocols are expected to be similar to the first Trump-Biden face-off. Candidates will be spaced a safe distance apart and they will not shake hands. The president is being counselled to use a softer touch this time around, after his belligerent attitude in the first debate was thought to have hurt him with suburban women, a key voting demographic. His advisers say allowing an opponent not always known for his way with words to speak uninterrupted could help his cause. The debate commission's decision to mute the other candidate's microphone during the initial two-minute answer period might also help impose some discipline on Trump and put the pressure on Biden to provide the kind of clear, extended answers to policy questions he avoided in the last debate. Any time Biden goes into greater detail about his positions, it risks angering various parts of his electoral coalition, made up of factions - left-wing progressives, blue-collar workers, Democratic moderates and disaffected Republicans - that have very different hopes for a Biden presidency. Trump could very well decide he still needs to go on the attack, of course - or, in the heat of the moment, abandon his planned strategy. Biden flashed his temper two weeks ago but mostly maintained his composure and avoided serious pitfalls. In the final set-piece of a long presidential campaign, he may be tested one more time. There may not have been a clear winner in the last Trump-Biden showdown, but moderator Chris Wallace could be counted among the losers. Despite his best efforts, the veteran journalist struggled to maintain control of the evening and failed to stop Mr Trump's incessant interruptions. Moderator Kristen Welker is already being attacked by Mr Trump This time, NBC's Kristen Welker will be in the hot seat. Before she has asked a single question, she is already under attack from the president. ""She's always been terrible & unfair, just like most of the Fake News reporters,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday. It's a departure from what his own campaign adviser, Jason Miller, told Fox News this month - that Ms Welker would do an ""excellent job"" of hosting the debate. ""I have a very high opinion of Kristen Welker,"" he said, echoing remarks from several of her journalist colleagues, who describe the long-time White House correspondent as tough and fair. From the outside, the candidates' debate preparation looks just as different as the candidates themselves. Mr Trump will host several rallies ahead of the debate Former Vice-President Joe Biden seems to be hunkering down in advance of the debate. He has no public events on his schedule this week and is sending top surrogates like running-mate Kamala Harris out on the trail instead. President Trump, on the other hand, is sticking to his typical schedule, hosting large rallies across the country. In the days before the debate, he'll hopscotch between live events in Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Maybe. According to voter surveys before and after the first debate by polling website FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos, voters reported a slight decline in support for Trump, and a slight boost for Biden. And in the days after the face-off, the former vice-president gained some ground in national polls, widening his lead by about three percentage points. Joe Biden saw a small bump in support after the first debate Still, debates are typically targeted at voters who have not yet made up their minds, and there don't seem to be many of them left. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that just 8% of likely voters are still on the fence about who they want as president. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We do need to see faster turnaround times"" England's NHS Test and Trace system needs to improve to provide faster results, Boris Johnson has conceded. At Thursday's coronavirus briefing, he said he shared ""people's frustrations"" at the turnaround times for results. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said it was ""very clear there's room for improvement"" in the system. It comes as figures showed just 15.1% of people who were tested received their result within 24 hours. These figures, for the week ending 14 October, are the lowest since the system began. The PM previously pledged thatall tests would be processed within 24 hours- unless there were issues with postal tests - by the end of June. 'We had more than 60 calls from test and trace' How do I get a coronavirus test? How does Covid-19 test-and-trace work? Speaking at a press conference at Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: ""I share people's frustrations and I understand totally why we do need to see faster turnaround times and we need to improve it. ""We need to make sure that people who do get a positive test self-isolate - that's absolutely crucial if this thing is going to work in the way that it can."" This video can not be played Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says there is ""room for improvement"" in test and trace Sir Patrick Vallance said the capacity for testing had increased, but ""it's really important to concentrate on numbers of contacts, isolation, as quickly as you can and getting things (results) back as quickly as you can. Ideally you get the whole process done within 48 hours"". ""It's very clear there's room for improvement on all that and therefore that could be diminishing the effectiveness of this."" He also said the the high number of infections diminished the effectiveness of the system. The percentage of people who received a test result within 24 hours has dropped from 32.8% in the previous week. The figures also showed a fall to 59.6% in the proportion of close contacts reached of people who tested positive. What do the chancellor's new plans mean for wages? This is also the lowest weekly percentage since the system began and is down from 63% in the previous week. The UK recorded,externalanother 21,242 cases on Thursday and 189 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Sir Patrick also told the briefing some coronavirus measures would be needed for some time to come. ""The numbers (of cases) speak for themselves. They are increasing and they are not going to decrease quickly,"" he told the No 10 news conference. ""I think it is likely that some measures of restriction are going to need to be in place for a while to try and get those numbers down."" Sir Patrick added that ""a lot depends now on what happens over the next few weeks"". ""At the moment, the numbers are heading in the wrong direction but there are some signs in some places of a potential flattening off of that. ""We need to wait and see and monitor the numbers very carefully."" Earlier the government released a job advert looking for a ""VP of operations"" to start immediately, with experience of ""turning around failing call centres"" on a day rate of up to Â£2,000. Hours later, the Department of Health withdrew the advert, saying it was being redrafted and the text had not been approved. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the statistics on test and trace ""have been bad every week"", while his colleague, shadow health minister, Justin Madders said: ""To have over 40% of people not even being contacted by the test and trace system is an interstellar-sized black hole in the government's plan to reduce transmission."" Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said the numbers showed ""a system struggling to make any difference to the epidemic"". He said he worried the increasing percentage of household contacts indicated ""a tick-box system rather than proper tracing"" with the value of the system being in reaching non-household contacts who are infectious but asymptomatic. Mr Naismith added the system ""has given a bird's eye view of the pandemic and done very little to halt it"". In other developments: Spain's Canary Islands and the Greek island of Mykonos were added to the government's safe travel list Thechancellor unveiled increased support for jobs and workershit by Covid restrictions Stoke-on-Trent, Coventry and Slough are to move into tier two restrictions on Saturday.

Sir Patrick also told the briefing some coronavirus measures would be needed for some time to come. ""The numbers (of cases) speak for themselves. They are increasing and they are not going to decrease quickly,"" he told the No 10 news conference. ""I think it is likely that some measures of restriction are going to need to be in place for a while to try and get those numbers down."" Sir Patrick added that ""a lot depends now on what happens over the next few weeks"". ""At the moment, the numbers are heading in the wrong direction but there are some signs in some places of a potential flattening off of that. ""We need to wait and see and monitor the numbers very carefully."" Earlier the government released a job advert looking for a ""VP of operations"" to start immediately, with experience of ""turning around failing call centres"" on a day rate of up to Â£2,000. Hours later, the Department of Health withdrew the advert, saying it was being redrafted and the text had not been approved. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the statistics on test and trace ""have been bad every week"", while his colleague, shadow health minister, Justin Madders said: ""To have over 40% of people not even being contacted by the test and trace system is an interstellar-sized black hole in the government's plan to reduce transmission."" Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said the numbers showed ""a system struggling to make any difference to the epidemic"". He said he worried the increasing percentage of household contacts indicated ""a tick-box system rather than proper tracing"" with the value of the system being in reaching non-household contacts who are infectious but asymptomatic. Mr Naismith added the system ""has given a bird's eye view of the pandemic and done very little to halt it"".

"The idea of a normal Christmas is a ""fiction"" and Scots should prepare for digital celebrations, national clinical director Jason Leitch has said. The government has insisted that the latest Covid-19 restrictions are having an impact on the spread of the virus. But Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland there was ""absolutely no question"" of a ""normal"" Christmas being allowed. Measures could be eased if case numbers fall, but Mr Leitch said people should ""get their digital Christmas ready"". Opposition politicians said the public would be ""devastated"" by the news and called for more details. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government was making ""really tough"" decisions and would not ""tell people what they want to hear to make it easier in the here and now"". Licensed trade warns of 'battle' to survive Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch What are the Covid rules where I live? Tight restrictions on the hospitality trade focused in particular on Scotland's central belt have been extended for another week as coronavirus case numbers continue to rise. These short-term measures are to be replaced with a new five-tier system of alert levels from 2 November, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that this does not rule out ""even tougher restrictions"" being imposed if necessary. Speaking on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch said the current curbs - along with the ongoing ban on household gatherings - was causing a ""deceleration"" in the increase of cases. He initially said it was ""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas, but sounded a note of caution over the prospect of measures being eased significantly over the winter. He said: ""I'm hopeful costs now may get us a more family Christmas. But Christmas is not going to be normal, there's absolutely no question about that. ""We are not going to be in large family groupings, with multiple families coming round - that is fiction for this year. ""I'm hopeful that if we can get numbers down to a certain level we may be able to get some form of normality. But people should get their digital Christmas ready."" Nicola Sturgeon said she may make Prof Leitch dress up as The Grinch following his comments Ms Sturgeon has previously insisted it was too early to plan for Christmas, saying it was too soon to tell what impact restrictions are having on the spread of the virus. The government will publish guidance this weekend about how families should celebrate Halloween, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""It is not safe right now to do these things as normal."" The first minister said that the more people stuck with the rules ""the more chance there is"" of a more normal festive period, but said government had to be ""honest and straightforward"" with people. She added: ""Some of the really tough additional things governments are doing right now with extra restrictions are also in part about trying to deal decisively with an upsurge in the virus now, so we give ourselves the best chance of greater normality at Christmas. ""Christmas this year for no country anywhere is going to be absolutely normal and without any restrictions. I could do what politicians would do in normal times and try to tell you otherwise, and let people down nearer the time, but that's not the right approach right now. ""We are not likely to be able to celebrate Christmas with no limits on how many people we have in our homes and on what we do."" She said that the ""best chance of getting as much normality over the Christmas period as possible is for all of us to abide by these restrictions and all the guidance right now"". Ms Sturgeon added that any restrictions would not prevent Santa from delivering presents to children on Christmas Eve, describing him as a ""key worker"". Following Prof Leitch's comments, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the government must allow an open public debate if it ""expects months more of sacrifices"". He said: ""People have made huge sacrifices for months on end, they will be devastated to hear that Christmas as they know it is cancelled this year. ""Many will rightly question whether the government have used the past six months as well as they could have to expand testing, shore up our NHS and prepare for a second wave."" Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Brian Whittle said ""clear and concise communication"" was important in controlling the virus. He said: ""We have to be realistic and accept that this Christmas very probably won't be normal, but that's a different thing from suggesting that families might only be able to get together online. ""When the public are so desperate for information, it's vital that every minister and official chooses their words carefully."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Scottish pub and restaurant businesses have been shut down by the coronavirus lockdown Scotland's licensed trade is facing a ""battle"" to survive after short-term Covid restrictions were extended, according to industry leaders. The country is due to move to a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. Until then the temporary regulations, targeting the central belt in particular, will continue. The Scottish Hospitality Group warned the extension would have ""devastating consequences"". The Scottish government said it had made a range of grants available to help businesses weather the financial pressures. But campaigners are demanding wider ranging support for the embattled industry after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would ""not be safe"" to ease any restrictions in the short term. Hospitality curbs extended for another week What are the new lockdown rules in Scotland? Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime: ""I don't think there is any doubt that very many successful businesses will not be able to ride this out and might not be able to open again. ""The battle is on to save the licensed trade in all its different forms."" Neil Douglas, who runs the Ardnamurchan restaurant, said the sector was ""enormously frustrated"" and added: ""If we get to the end of the year without losing people I would be amazed."" Bars and restaurants infive NHS health board areas- containing about 3.4m people - were closed on 9 October as part of what Ms Sturgeon called a ""short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection"". Hospitality venues in other parts of the country can only serve alcohol outdoors. These measures were originally meant to expire on 26 October, but on Wednesday the first minister said they would now continue until a new ""strategic framework"" comes into force. This multi-tier system will involve different levels of restrictions that can be applied nationally or regionally depending on the level of infection. It is due to be published on Friday, and debated by MSPs after Holyrood's half term recess. This video can not be played Neil Douglas, who runs Ardnamurchan, says: ""If we get to the end of the year without losing people I would be amazed."" In the meantime the Scottish government has pledgedadditional funding for businesses,externalaffected by the temporary restrictions: Businesses required to close by the regulations will qualify for one-off grants of up to Â£4,310 Those that may remain open but are directly impacted by the restrictions may qualify for a hardship fund grant of up to Â£2,155. Additional grants of Â£1,650 will help those firms that are required to close to help meet the 20% employer's contribution under the UK government's furlough scheme. The one-off grants cover the period until 2 November and will be replaced by a new system of business support to complement the five-tier system. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ""While the extension of the restrictions is based on the fundamental need to reduce transmissions of the virus, I understand that many business owners will be very disappointed that they cannot reopen next week. ""Our funding plan will help these grants reach businesses as quickly as possible to protect jobs over this period and I encourage business owners to apply for support."" She added that the grants are ""the maximum level of support"" that can be provided before the new system is introduced next month but confirmed more help is being sought from the Treasury. Staff wore protective visors as they served pints at the SWG3 beer garden in Glasgow when it reopened in July after lockdown Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: ""Recent restrictions were framed as a 'temporary' short, sharp shock, but the extension is an indication that we can only expect a continued government stranglehold on hospitality that will have devastating consequences."" Mr Montgomery said the proposed Â£40m funding package, which was announced to coincide with the initial 16-day closure, was a ""drop in the ocean"" for the country's 16,700 licensed hospitality businesses. In Manchester he said business owners could receive up to Â£31,000 per licensed premises from the UK government'sÂ£60m support packagecompared to the Scottish government's ""woefully inadequate"" grants. Mr Montgomery added: ""Without further financial support, Scotland's hospitality industry will be crippled to the point of no return."" After the first minister's announcement the Save our Jobs campaign demanded support from Holyrood and Westminster to protect jobs in bars and restaurants across the country when the furlough scheme ends on 31 October. Michelin star chef Tom Kitchin said: ""Our industry is in a real need of help, especially having only just partly recovered from the first lockdown. ""We have worked so hard to keep our guests and diners safe in hospitality settings, taking all safety precautions needed to remain safe while enjoying good food and drink. ""Eliminating the risks of the virus is obviously our greatest concern, but there needs to be a balance for the hospitality future of Scotland."" Signature Group boss Nic Wood said he hopes the campaign would highlight the ""plight"" of the young hospitality workforce, with 50% of all staff aged between 16 and 24. The Campaign for Real Ale described the week-long extension as a ""hammer blow"" to pubs and breweries across the country. Joe Crawford, director for Scotland, said: ""These businesses feel like they are being offered up as a sacrificial lamb without sufficient evidence that pubs - who have done everything they have been asked to track and trace customers and make their venues Covid-secure - are responsible for transmission of the virus."" Industry leaders have warned many pubs forced to close may not reopen. Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said many employers have invested heavily to create safe and controlled environments in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus. Ms Cameron added: ""We have been living with this virus for seven months now. We should be able to deliver the capacity to provide test and protect in every business premises and in every airport in Scotland."" Meanwhile, the Scottish drinks industry charity has issued a warning about the mental health impact of the pandemic on the ""unbelievable"" number of workers who now face an uncertain future. John Hutchinson, president ofThe Ben,external, told Drivetime: ""The stories are harrowing. ""It can genuinely bring you to tears when you hear that people are living week to week with under Â£1 in their bank accounts, trying to support their families and keep their house warm. ""As we get into winter and times are getting tough people are now looking at eviction and really just losing their house as well."" Mr Hutchison said the charity has teamed up withBreathing Space,externaland urged those struggling to contact the free support service. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay nearly $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to end a probe of its role in the 1MDB corruption scandal. The bank's Malaysian subsidiary also admitted in US court that it had paid more than $1bn in bribes to win work raising money for the Malaysian state-owned wealth fund. US officials said the record settlement reflected Goldman's ""central"" role in a ""massive corruption scheme"". Goldman admitted it had fallen ""short"", calling it an ""institutional failure"". In all, the investment bank is due to pay about $5bn in penalties - about two thirds of its 2019 profits - to regulators around the world, including in the UK, to resolve cases that have severely tarnished the firm's reputation. Goldman's board also said it will recoup or withhold $174m in compensation awarded to executives, including retired boss Lloyd Blankfein, under whose watch the scandal happened. ""The board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,"" it said in a statement. The 1MDB scheme was a global web of fraud and corruption, in which billions of dollars ostensibly raised for public development projects in Malaysia instead landed in private pockets, including those of the country's former prime minister Najib Razak. Malaysia ex-PM given 12-year term for corruption Goldman Sachs settles 1MDB with Malaysia for $3.9bn US targets Monet and Warhol artworks in 1MDB case Authorities in Asia, the US and Europe have spent years tracking down cash and assets paid for with money stolen from the Malaysian fund, including property, jewellery and art. Najib Razak (centre) was prime minister from 2009 to 2018. Corruption allegations played a role in his election defeat In announcing the settlement on Thursday, US Department of Justice officials said Goldman Sachs had enabled a scheme that caused ""significant harm"". ""That harm was borne principally and in the first instance by the people of Malaysia, who saw a fund created to benefit them... instead turned into a piggybankÂ for corrupt public officials and their cronies,"" said Brian Rabbitt, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's criminal division. In July, Najib was found guilty in Malaysia on all seven counts in the first of several multi-million dollar corruption trials and sentenced to 12 years in jail. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power and is appealing the decision. Probes of Goldman Sachs focused on its help raising $6.5bn in 2012 and 2013 for the fund formally known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), work authorities said earned the firm more than $600m. Goldman had long blamed rogue employees, asserting it had no idea the money it helped raise would be diverted from planned development projects within Malaysia. But on Thursday, the bank admitted that its Malaysian unit had ""knowingly and willingly"" paid bribes to foreign officials and that it had ignored red flags that should have alerted higher-ups to problems with the deal. Goldman boss David Solomon said the bank ""fell short"" in its oversight It agreed to return the $600m to Malaysia and pay roughly $2.3bn to regulators in the US, UK, Hong Kong and Singapore. The settlement with the US charged the parent company with bribery violations, but authorities agreed to defer prosecution. That move allows Goldman to avoid a criminal conviction, a black mark that would have forced some clients to end work with the fund. Earlier, one former Goldman Sachs partner, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to launder money and violating foreign bribery laws. Another executive is awaiting trial on foreign bribery offenses. ""We have to acknowledge where our firm fell short,"" chief executive David Solomon said. ""While many good people worked on these transactions and tried to do the right thing, we recognise that we did not adequately address red flags and scrutinise the representations of certain members of the deal team... as effectively as we should have."" Three months ago, Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the corruption scandal. The settlement included a $2.5bn cash payout by Goldman, while the investment bank said it would guarantee that the government would receive at least $1.4bn from money recovered from the scheme. The deal resolved charges in Malaysia that Goldman had misled investors. Hong Kong regulators on Thursday said they were due to receive $350m in fines. Goldman has also agreed to pay $126m in penalties in the UK and $122m in penalties in Singapore.

"Durham University says such behaviour ""will not be tolerated"" Students have been left feeling ""threatened"" and unsafe after a LGBT university association Zoom meeting was ""hijacked"" by more than 15 people shouting ""homophobic slurs"". The online meeting at Durham University was disrupted with loud music, shouted abuse and ""sexually explicit videos"", say LGBT groups at the university. The event was for new students who are already facing Covid restrictions. Durham University said such behaviour ""will not be tolerated"". ""To hijack an event like this in such an aggressive and targeted way is nothing less than a hate crime,"" said a statement from LGBT groups at the university, including St Mary's College, where the incident took place earlier this month. The anonymous attackers were able to join the Zoom meeting through an address shared within the college for the welcoming event. Durham University condemns 'abhorrent' online posts Durham withdraws offer of place over online comments More than 950 Durham student Covid cases Such ""malicious behaviour"" was even worse when the pandemic made it difficult for students to meet in person and support each other, said the LGBT associations' statement. ""The fact that this was not simply an individual acting alone, but rather a co-ordinated attack from a number of people, is a reminder of how routinely unsafe and unwelcome our community is made to feel,"" said the LGBT groups, which warned of a ""toxic culture"" at the university. Earlier this week, the Guardian reported on claims that students at Durham were being bullied andmocked over their northern accents,externaland coming from poorer backgrounds. Last month, Durham University condemned what it called ""utterly abhorrent"" comments on social media by students set to start at the university. It included references to competing to have sex with ""the poorest girl"". Sam Dale, the university's director of student support and wellbeing, said the university knew of the ""Zoom bombing"" and how it had left participants feeling ""distressed"". ""Such behaviour is not acceptable at Durham University and will not be tolerated. Incidents will be reported to the police.Â ""Every member of the university is expected to treat others with respect and tolerance so that every member of our community can live, study and work in a safe and inclusive environment,"" said Mr Dale. 950 students diagnosed with Covid-19 in a week California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips the city What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Who joined Demi as a big winner at the Golden Globes?

"Mr Becker appeared at Southwark Crown Court where he denied all 28 charges against him Ex-tennis champion Boris Becker has appeared in court accused of failing to hand over trophies from his playing days so they could be sold to pay debts. The three-time Wimbledon winner was declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to a bank. He is accused of not complying with obligations to disclose information. Mr Becker denied all 28 charges against him at a Southwark Crown Court hearing in London on Thursday. The 28-count indictment includes mention of his 1985 All England Club trophy, his 1989 silverware from the same tournament, and his Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996. Boris Becker was the youngest ever Wimbledon men's singles champion, aged 17 The 52-year-old German national is also accused of concealing more than Â£1m held in bank accounts, in addition to property in the UK and abroad. The court heard that he failed to declare his property interest in an address in Chelsea, south-west London, with similar charges for two properties in his home town of Leimen. Mr Becker is also accused of removing hundreds of thousands of pounds by transferring it to other accounts, including to former wife Barbara Becker, and estranged wife Sharlely ""Lilly"" Becker. It is also alleged he hid his holding of shares in a firm called Breaking Data Corp. Mr Becker appeared to record himself on his mobile phone at Southwark Crown Court Mr Becker was released on bail ahead of his trial next September, which is set to last up to four weeks. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the retired sportsman and television presenter may face further charges at a later date. Defence counsel Jonathan Caplan said: ""He (Mr Becker) is determined to face and contest these charges and restore his reputation in relation to the allegations made against him."" The former world number one and six-time Grand Slam champion collected 49 singles titles out of 77 finals during his 16 years as a professional tennis player.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring?

That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

"American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on eight key issues. President Trumpset up a coronavirus task force at the end of January which he says has now shifted its focus to ""safety and opening up our country"". The president is also prioritising the speedy development of coronavirus treatments and vaccines, directing $10bn towards such projects. Mr Bidenwants to set up a national contact-tracing programme, establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, and provide free coronavirus testing to all. He supports a nationwide mask mandate, which would require face coverings to be worn on federal property. A simple guide to the US election President Trumpis a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Mr Bidensays he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2tn investment in green energy. How election could decide battle against climate change President Trumphas pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Mr Bidenwants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (Â£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25 (Â£5.50). Trump economy in six charts President Trumpwants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Mr Bidenwants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also wants to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. Four lives depending on 'Obamacare' President Trumphas reiterated his promise to bring down US troop levels overseas, while continuing to invest in the military. The president says he will continue to challenge international alliances and maintain trade tariffs on China. Mr Bidenhas promised to repair relationships with US allies. He says he would do away with unilateral tariffs on China, and instead hold them accountable with an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". How would Biden change US foreign policy? President Trumpsays he doesn't believe racism is a systemic problem within US police forces. He has positioned himself as a firm advocate of law enforcement, but has opposed chokeholds and offered grants for improved practices. Mr Bidenviews racism as a systemic problem, and has set out policies to address racial disparities in the justice system, such as grants to incentivise states in reducing incarceration rates. He has rejected calls to defund police, saying additional resources should instead be tied to maintaining proper standards. Seven solutions to US police problems President Trumphas an expansive interpretation of the US constitution's Second Amendment protections giving Americans the right to bear arms. He did propose tightening background checks on gun buyers after a string of mass shootings in 2019, but nothing came of the plan and no further legislation has been put forward. Mr Bidenhas proposed banning assault weapons, universal background checks, limiting the number of guns a person can purchase to one per month, and making it easier to sue negligent gun manufacturers and sellers. He would also fund more research into preventing gun violence. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? President Trumpsays it's his constitutional right to fill the vacancy on the court during the remainder of his first term in office, and has put forward conservative judge, Amy Coney Barrett. One issue that the Supreme Court could soon rule on is the legal right to abortion in the US - something the president and Judge Barrett have opposed in the past. Mr Bidenwants the vacancy to be filled after the next president enters office. He says if elected he would work to pass legislation to guarantee a woman's right to an abortion if the Supreme Court rules against it. What is the US Supreme Court?

"It's been four years since Donald Trump made a string of promises during his long 2016 campaign to be the 45th president of the United States. Four years later, his supporters often cite ""promises made, promises kept"" as a reason why they're backing him again. Many of them made headlines - from banning all Muslims entering the US, to building a border wall paid for by Mexico. But others went a little under the radar, like his pledge to eliminate the national debt. So how has he done in keeping his promises? Before election:Trump promised to lower the corporate tax rate and bring in huge tax cuts for working Americans. After:The Republican tax plan passed in December 2017, and it largely ticks the box for the president although its merits are hotly disputed. He has had to compromise on his pledge to bring corporation tax down from 35% to 15% (it will be 21% instead). And the tax cuts for individuals will expire, although Republicans say future governments will simply renew them. But wealthy Americans are expected to benefit more than poorer ones. Not everyone saw their taxes lowered. For some higher earners in urbanised, mostlyÂ DemocraticÂ states, taxes went up due to a cap on state and local property and income tax deductions. What is in Republican tax plan? US economy under Trump: The greatest ever? Before:As a candidate, Mr Trump derided climate change as a hoax concocted by China, and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth. After:After three months of hemming and hawing behind the closed doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the president came down decisively on the side near the exits. Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, is unequivocally a promise kept. The exit officially takes effect 4 November, the day after the US election. Reaction to Trump Paris deal decision Before:""I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents."" After:He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has appointed two - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Mr Gorsuch's appointment required a procedural change to Senate rules, but it was Mr Kavanaugh's appointment that was particularly controversial. Mr Kavanaugh faced sexual assault allegations - which he denied - and was eventually voted through by 50-48 - the tightest nomination vote since 1881. What's more, his third nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is on course to be confirmed. If approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, she could ensure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades to come. In addition to making his mark on the top court, Mr Trump has appointed nearly 200 conservative judges to lower federal courts. How has Trump's Supreme Court changed America? If approved, Amy Coney Barrett would be the third justice President Trump has successfully nominated for the top court Before:One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered. It is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a ""job killer"" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals. After:Republicans have been unable to pass a repeal or reform bill. That said, the Trump administration has managed to dismantle parts of the law - enrolment periods have been shortened, some subsidies have been axed, and the fine for people who did not purchase health insurance has been eliminated as part of the 2017 tax plan. And in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled that repealing this penalty, an ""essential"" part of the law, meant the entirety of Obamacare is therefore unconstitutional. The law, however, remains in place as an appeal heads to the US Supreme Court, with a ruling expected sometime in 2021. This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words Before:His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises. Mr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it. After:Mexico poured scorn on the claim that it would pay for such a barrier, and even Mr Trump appears to have dropped that idea. Democrats are vociferously opposed to a wall, whereas some Republicans have baulked at a bill that could reach $21.5bn (Â£17bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report. In December 2018 the US government went into shutdown after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn to fund the wall. He has since redirected defence and some other funds to build or replace sections of the wall, a decision that has faced legal challenges. As of late May, 194 miles of wall system had been built, mostly to shore up dilapidated or outdated designs of the barrier already in place - just three miles construction was part of an entirely new system. Trump's border wall - in seven charts This video can not be played Many Trump voters are happy with his progress Before:During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb the so-called Islamic State group into obliteration. After:The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan. He also takes credit for driving IS out of parts of Iraq and Syria, saying the group has been ""largely defeated"", although that process was under way under Obama. Last year, IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos. Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? Before:Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim. After:In 2017, he said he formally recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and approved moving the US embassy. It opened in May 2018 to coincide with Israel's 70th anniversary. The construction of a permanent US embassy building in Jerusalem was approved in 2019. Before:""I'm going to build a military that's going to be much stronger than it is right now. It's going to be so strong, nobody's going to mess with us,"" Donald Trump said on the campaign trail in October 2015. He promised to reverse defence cuts brought in by President Barack Obama in 2013. ""We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military dominance,"" he said. After:Defence spending has indeed risen steadily throughout the Trump presidency - although overall levels remain below the first years of the Obama administration. Military spending increased dramatically from 2002 as the US entered protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It peaked in 2010 as a percentage of GDP - the value of all goods and services - after which the US began stepping back from its engagement in the Middle East and Central Asia. Has Trump kept his promises on the military? Before:Just a month before his election win in November 2016, Mr Trump said he could cut as many as 70% of US federal regulations if elected. ""It's just stopping businesses from growing,""he told an audience in New Hampshire. The promise drew him support from large and small businesses, who helped him to victory that year. After:The president has slashed through regulations on everything from labour to the environment. Just days after taking office he signed the Presidential Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which mandated that when government departments asked for a federal regulation, they had to specify two others they would drop. Throughout his term he has continued to slash back red tape. In January 2020 he scrapped protections for US wetlands and streams, and in July he announced changes to the National Environmental Protection Act in a bid to speed up infrastructure projects. ""We are reclaiming America's proud heritage as a nation that gets things done,"" he said. 'Trump's done what he said he would for business' Five things Trump has said about the environment Before:Mr Trump has long called for the US to leave the Middle East. On the 2016 campaign trail, he said the region was a ""total and complete mess"" and wished the government had spent the trillions of dollars in the US instead. His talk of an end to US military deployments overseas predates his presidential run. In 2013, he tweeted: ""Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA."" That same year, he said the US should ""stay the hell out"" of the Syrian war. After:In September 2017, the Trump administration announced the deployment of 3,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Mr Trump said his approach would be based on conditions on the ground. In Syria, the US had led a coalition against IS along with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, with around 2,000 troops on the ground. By December 2018, Mr Trump ordered the withdrawal of all US troops from Syria, though about half the troops, approximately 500, still remain. Mr Trump recently said he has plans to further cut troops in Afghanistan - after reducing them to 8,600 from 13,000 over the spring and summer  - before the 3 November election. In February, US and Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops from the country within 14 months if Taliban militants uphold a new peace agreement. The president's efforts to pull down troops has at times been met with criticism from his own officials. Following Mr Trump's announcement of a Syria withdrawalin part prompted the resignation of US Defence Secretary James Mattis. Trump rewrites US Syria policy US and Taliban sign deal to end 18-year Afghan war Before:Mr Trump called Nafta ""a disaster"" and warned that the TPP ""is going to be worse, so we will stop it"". He also pledged to correct the trade deficit with China. After:Mr Trump followed through in his first few days on his pledge to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He later said he would consider re-joining the TPP if he got a better deal. On 30 November, after protracted negotiations, the US, Canada and Mexico signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was designed to replace Nafta and recently came into force. However, the US has reimposed aluminium tariffs on Canada, and Ottawa reciprocated with retaliatory tariffs. The US and South Korea also signed a revised trade pact in September 2018. The US and China, meanwhile, became embroiled in an escalating trade battle - with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. Despite ongoing tensions, in August the US and China held talks over theirso-called ""phase-one"" trade deal - signed early this year- that is aimed at easing the trade war. US-China trade war in 300 words US and China hold 'constructive' trade talks Before:Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a ""total and complete"" shutdown should remain until the US authorities ""can figure out what's going on"". But he switched to ""extreme vetting"" after he became the party's presidential candidate. After:As president, he introduced two travel bans which became ensnarled in the courts - but the third had more luck. The US Supreme Court ruled President Trump's ban on six mainly Muslim countries can go into full effect, pending legal challenges. The current ban restricts travellers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea. And in January, the US has announced it was expanding its curbs on immigration to include six more countries. Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas. Trump travel ban: What happens next? Nigeria worst hit in new Trump visa ban Before:Mr Trump said in September 2016 that he would reverse the deal President Barack Obama had struck to reopen diplomatic relations and improve trade. After:As president, he told an audience in Miami that he was ""cancelling the Obama administration's one-sided deal."" In 2017, Mr Trump reimposed some trade and travel restrictions lifted by his predecessor. He kept the embassy open in Havana, although without naming an ambassador to the country. Last year, the administration announced a ban on travel to Cuba for American group tours as well as cruise ships journeying to the island Until then, US tourism to Cuba was not permitted, but certain forms of organised group travel, known as ""people-to-people"" travel, had been allowed. This month the US administration announced further restrictions, saying it would suspend all private charter flights between the United States and Cuba, to increase economic pressure on Havana. The suspension comes into force on 13 October. Before:Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a ""currency manipulator"" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of ""raping"" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods. After:In August 2019, the administration officially named China as a ""currency manipulator"". The US Treasury department defines currency manipulation as when countries deliberately influence the exchange rate between their currency and the US dollar to gain ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". But in January, the US reversed its decision when China had agreed to refrain from devaluing its currency to make its own goods cheaper for foreign buyers. US reverses China 'currency manipulator' label Before:""I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them,""Donald Trump told the Washington Post,externalin 2016, and promised to clear the country's then-$19tn national debt ""over a period of eight years"". After:Halfway through that eight-year promise, the US national debt has ballooned by more than a third, hitting $27tn in October 2020. Mr Trump increased the national debt ceiling in 2017, before suspending it until after the 2020 election in July 2019. It is predicted the debt will rise even further once the full economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic becomes apparent. Before:Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are estimated to be more than 11.3 million - ""have to go"". After:As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who ""are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers"". In fiscal year 2019 deportations were at 267,000, a slight rise on the year before, though not as high as the 2012 peak of 410,000 under the Obama administration. Mr Trump's plans for immigration reform faced defeat this summer when the Supreme Court ruled against his administration's bid to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), which protects about 650,000 young people who entered the US without documents as children. Trump voter's husband faces deportation Before:The country's infrastructure ""will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it"", he said in his victory speech in November. After:Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but as yet, there is little sign of action. By March 2018 Congress had allocated $21bn for infrastructure spending - far short of the $1.5tn Mr Trump has called for.The money will be spent on a wide range of upgrades and investments,external, according to a congressional graphic. In April 2019, Mr Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to spend $2tn on infrastructure, an agreement that later fell apart. This June there were reports the Trump administration had a $1tn plan in the works, but no announcement has been made. Before:Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it ""obsolete"". One issue that irked him was whether members were pulling their weight and ""paying their bills"". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia. After:But as he hosted Nato's secretary general at the White House in April 2018, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. ""I said it [Nato] was obsolete,"" Mr Trump said. ""It's no longer obsolete."" In July 2018, Mr Trump reiterated his support at the Nato summit, but suggested the US might still leave if allies did not acquiesce to his budget demands. Mr Trump has continued to argue that Canada and European members of Nato  are not spending enough to support the alliance, and recently said the US will move nearly 12,000 troops out of Germany. What does the US do for Nato? Before:Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding ""immediately"" and ""make it also much worse"", adding ""torture works"". After:But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the countervailing belief, espoused by former Defence Secretary James Mattis and then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state. Mr Pompeo said during his CIA confirmation hearing that he would ""absolutely not"" reinstate such methods. Before:""Lock her up"" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters. They wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state. And Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: ""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation."" After:The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was ""such a nasty woman"" as someone the country owed ""a debt of gratitude"". Later, he said he ""hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought"" and had other priorities. In November 2016 Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton ""heal"".

"The idea of a normal Christmas is a ""fiction"" and Scots should prepare for digital celebrations, national clinical director Jason Leitch has said. The government has insisted that the latest Covid-19 restrictions are having an impact on the spread of the virus. But Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland there was ""absolutely no question"" of a ""normal"" Christmas being allowed. Measures could be eased if case numbers fall, but Mr Leitch said people should ""get their digital Christmas ready"". Opposition politicians said the public would be ""devastated"" by the news and called for more details. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government was making ""really tough"" decisions and would not ""tell people what they want to hear to make it easier in the here and now"". Licensed trade warns of 'battle' to survive Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch What are the Covid rules where I live? Tight restrictions on the hospitality trade focused in particular on Scotland's central belt have been extended for another week as coronavirus case numbers continue to rise. These short-term measures are to be replaced with a new five-tier system of alert levels from 2 November, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that this does not rule out ""even tougher restrictions"" being imposed if necessary. Speaking on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch said the current curbs - along with the ongoing ban on household gatherings - was causing a ""deceleration"" in the increase of cases. He initially said it was ""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas, but sounded a note of caution over the prospect of measures being eased significantly over the winter. He said: ""I'm hopeful costs now may get us a more family Christmas. But Christmas is not going to be normal, there's absolutely no question about that. ""We are not going to be in large family groupings, with multiple families coming round - that is fiction for this year. ""I'm hopeful that if we can get numbers down to a certain level we may be able to get some form of normality. But people should get their digital Christmas ready."" Nicola Sturgeon said she may make Prof Leitch dress up as The Grinch following his comments Ms Sturgeon has previously insisted it was too early to plan for Christmas, saying it was too soon to tell what impact restrictions are having on the spread of the virus. The government will publish guidance this weekend about how families should celebrate Halloween, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""It is not safe right now to do these things as normal."" The first minister said that the more people stuck with the rules ""the more chance there is"" of a more normal festive period, but said government had to be ""honest and straightforward"" with people. She added: ""Some of the really tough additional things governments are doing right now with extra restrictions are also in part about trying to deal decisively with an upsurge in the virus now, so we give ourselves the best chance of greater normality at Christmas. ""Christmas this year for no country anywhere is going to be absolutely normal and without any restrictions. I could do what politicians would do in normal times and try to tell you otherwise, and let people down nearer the time, but that's not the right approach right now. ""We are not likely to be able to celebrate Christmas with no limits on how many people we have in our homes and on what we do."" She said that the ""best chance of getting as much normality over the Christmas period as possible is for all of us to abide by these restrictions and all the guidance right now"". Ms Sturgeon added that any restrictions would not prevent Santa from delivering presents to children on Christmas Eve, describing him as a ""key worker"". Following Prof Leitch's comments, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the government must allow an open public debate if it ""expects months more of sacrifices"". He said: ""People have made huge sacrifices for months on end, they will be devastated to hear that Christmas as they know it is cancelled this year. ""Many will rightly question whether the government have used the past six months as well as they could have to expand testing, shore up our NHS and prepare for a second wave."" Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Brian Whittle said ""clear and concise communication"" was important in controlling the virus. He said: ""We have to be realistic and accept that this Christmas very probably won't be normal, but that's a different thing from suggesting that families might only be able to get together online. ""When the public are so desperate for information, it's vital that every minister and official chooses their words carefully."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Michel Barnier resumed talks on Friday after arriving in the UK on Thursday evening. Talks over a post-Brexit trade deal have resumed in London, after negotiators returned to the table following a week-long standoff. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss insisted a deal can still be done with the EU, as officials began a new round of ""intensified"" daily talks. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that ""every day counts"" ahead of a looming December deadline. He said both sides share a ""huge common responsibility"" as talks restarted. Negotiations stalled last week after a summit in Brussels where EU leaderscalled on the UKto ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. But the UK side agreed to resume talks after Mr Barnier said ""compromises on both sides"" were needed, in a speech on Wednesday. UK 'ready to welcome EU' to continue trade talks Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. Key areas of disagreement include fishing rights, post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. Speaking after the UKformally signedits post-Brexit trade deal with Japan, Ms Truss said the UK also wanted to strike a ""good deal with the EU"". ""We're in intense negotiations with the EU. We've made real progress,"" she told reporters on Friday. In an interview with the BBC, she added any agreement would have to be based ""on the principle that the UK is a sovereign nation"". At a signing ceremony in Tokyo, Japan's foreign minister also called on the EU and UK to reach a deal, which he said was important to Japanese firms. Arriving in the UK on Thursday, ahead of a meeting with UK counterpart Lord David Frost, Mr Barnier told reporters it was ""important to be back at the table"". The pair will meet again on Friday, during an ""initial"" renewed negotiation round running until Sunday, with subsequent talks planned in both Brussels and London. These later talks could either take place in person or be held via video link if Covid restrictions apply, if both sides agree. In line with a demand made by the UK, both sides will resume talks on all subjects based on proposed legal texts prepared by officials. Theyhave also agreed,externalthat ""nothing is agreed"" until progress has been reached in all areas - which has been a key demand of the EU. You could be forgiven for thinking that what we've witnessed over the past few days is a bit of political theatre. Cover for the government - post chest-beating- to return to the negotiating table where they know the time has now come for tough compromises to be made. EU leaders also went out of their way to sound tough on Brexit at their summit last week. Privately, a number of EU figures now admit it was a misstep. But EU leaders play to the domestic gallery too. They wanted to show they were ""standing up to the UK"" - that leaving the EU doesn't pay and that EU interests would be defended. Read more from Katya here The two sides have been at odds over the issue of so-called ""state aid"" rules, which limit government help for industry in the name of ensuring fair economic competition. The UK has rejected an EU demand made earlier in the year for it to continue following the bloc's rules on such subsidies as part of a trade agreement. Lord Frost has suggested the UK could instead agree ""principles"" for how subsidies are spent - something welcomed by Mr Barnier on Wednesday. The two sides are also haggling over how much European fishing boats should be able to catch in British waters from next year. The EU has so far resisted UK demands for annual talks to decide stock limits, as well as a reduction in access for its vessels to British fishing grounds. By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization. YOUR WORK, YOUR MONEY:Is my bar business better off in Tier 3?

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the testing system in England must improve, but defends its capacity as ""colossal"" He holds a briefing alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance Further support for workers in parts of England under tier two restrictions are announced by the chancellor Under the new Job Support Scheme the government will fund up to half of the wages of people unable to work their full hours Firms in affected areas will also be eligible for cash grants of up to Â£2,100 a month Stoke, Coventry and Slough will be moved into tier 2 Covid restrictions Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s - who was the country's prime minister until last month - admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 Greater Manchester will enter tier three restrictions just after midnight Edited by John Hand We are pausing our live coverage for today, thank you for joining us. We will resume our coverage tomorrow morning. As we bring our live coverage to a close, here's a final roundup of today's key developments in the UK: Take a look at our charts with the latest on coronavirus in the UK - including a map of the local authorities with extra restrictions in place and the most recent data on the number of positive cases.  Gavin BevisBBC News Nottingham's seven-day coronavirus infection rate has fallen again. The latest figure - reflecting cases for the week to 19 October - is 561.4 per 100,000 people, down from 604.5 yesterday. Nottingham now has the fifth highest rate in England, behind Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Rossendale and Liverpool. The city and county of Nottinghamshire are still waiting to hear whether they will be made subject to tier three restrictions in the coming days. A meeting between local leaders and a government minister was due to take place at 16:30. During his coronavirus briefing, televised live on BBC One this afternoon, Boris Johnson said he wanted to travel ""a middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus"". Scylla is a monster from Greek mythology who lived on a rock. While Charybdis refers to a nearby deadly whirlpool. Heroic figures such as Odysseus would have to pick a careful course between the two foes to avoid being eaten or drowned.

Two in five children aged 11 to 16 in England feel the coronavirus lockdown has made their lives worse,an NHS report on mental health suggests. They said their biggest anxieties were about missing school and family and friends contracting Covid-19. Mental disorders have risen across both genders since 2017. In boys, they rose from 11% to 16% and in girls from 10% to 15%, the report found. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, described the increase as ""extremely alarming"" and called for a properly-funded children's mental health service and for every school to have its own NHS-funded counsellor. The report is based on a survey of 3,570 children and young people up to the age of 22 who were interviewed in 2017 and followed up online in July during the coronavirus pandemic. Responding to questions about whether West Yorkshire could move into tier three, a statement just issued by Leeds City Council says: âWe are awaiting further talks with government regarding restrictions that are in place to tackle coronavirus in Leeds. ""At this current time we are not expecting tier status to change in Leeds this week.â Earlier today the government said discussions with West Yorkshire (Bradford, Leeds, Kirklees, Calderdale, Wakefield) about moving to the very high alert level were ongoing. Rishi Sunak has given an interview to explain the new measures he is taking to adapt his Winter Economic Plan, reflecting new regional restrictions in England. ""I've always said that we would need to adapt our
financial support as the situation evolves,"" he said. ""That's why today we're
announcing three measures that will ensure that we can protect more jobs and
support more businesses through the difficult winter months ahead."" Mr Sunak added he has always said he would ""adapt and evolve our support as the health situation
changes and that's clearly what's happened over the past few weeks"". Employers, he said, ""believe in the principle that this is a shared
endeavour that they want to support their employees alongside the government
and taxpayer, and they think it's right that employees are doing some work"". He ends with a message to people in England: ""Whether you're in a tier two
area [or a] tier three area, we've got support in place for you on a national basis"". A timely reminder as to the reason why you are seeing the prime minister and the chanellor together addressing BBC One viewers in the afternoon. The latest daily update shows the UK recorded another 21,242 coronavirus cases according to thegovernment's dashboard,external, while a further 189 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. The Spanish Canary Islands, the Maldives, Denmark and the Greek island of Mykonos have been added to the UK's list of travel corridors, the transport secretary has announced. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said people returning from these destinations from 04.00 BST on Sunday will no longer need to self-isolate for two weeks. However, Liechtenstein has become the only country to lose its exemption this week, meaning people returning from the country will need to quarantine on their return. Allow Twitter content?

Lastly, Jane Kirby of the Press Association asked Sir Patrick Vallance if a decent level of roll-out of a potential vaccine is achieved by next spring, how soon people might be able to stop social distancing and wearing face coverings. She asked the PM if he would reconsider his opposition to a national circuit break - a short, sharp lockdown - if those in Northern Ireland and Wales are shown to be more effective than tier three restrictions in England. Sir Patrick replies first, insisting he will not speculate on how effective the vaccines are going to be, but says once we know how effective they are, it could be determined ""how to use them best"". ""Clearly the aim of vaccination is to try to take most of the load of the infection spread onto the vaccine in order to be able to relieve other measures and that's got to be an aim we would all wish for,"" he adds. The PM said a national circuit break would be ""very damaging"" economically, socially and mentally for the country. ""We do think the local measures are right, and I repeat my gratitude to local leadership across the country, people who are helping to get the R rate down across their neighbourhoods... and that's what we're going to continue with."" Chris Smyth from the Times asked if the level of financial help will be available until a vaccine is in widespread use. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Job Support Scheme will last for at least six months through to the spring with a review point halfway through. Boris Johnson said ""billions more is going in to support jobs and livelihoods"" but adds ""we are going to have to pay this money back"". He said the government's objective is to keep the economy going so ""the UK can bounce back"". Smyth also asked if the test and trace scheme can still keep up with rising cases. Boris Johnson replied that there are ""interesting testing technologies"" being developed but added ""for the moment we have to use the tools we've got"". On vaccines, Sir Patrick said ""things are progressing well"" but suggest ""the widespread use of vaccines isn't going to be until spring next year"". Richard Partington of the Guardian asks the PM and the chancellor why the government was prepared to ""go to the wall"" over Â£5m with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham during the tier three negotiations, when they were preparing to announce ""billions of pounds"" more support in today's expansion. Boris Johnson says the negotiations between regional leaders and the government was ""all about fairness"" and making sure ""everybody got the same package"". He said No 10 is looking to address the national picture now and change with the evolving virus situation. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks if today's financial measures are an acknowledgement that ""you were not supporting parts of the north of England properly during the summer"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak replies: ""We want people to have equal support wherever they are."" Rigby also asks Sir Patrick Vallance if he is disappointed that the test and trace scheme is reaching less than 60% of contacts. ""It is very clear there is room for improvement,"" says Sir Patrick. He adds that the ""effectiveness of test and trace is less when the case numbers are high"". Ben Kentish of LBC asks about the latest NHS test and trace figures which showed that just 15% of coronavirus test results were returned within 24 hours. Boris Johnson says he ""shares peoples' frustrations"" and acknowledged the need to improve the situation to get faster turnaround times. He defends the achievements of the scheme as ""colossal"", including the expansion of testing capacity, adding that the ""technology is improving the whole time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income."" She also asks Sir Patrick Vallance about whether people elsewhere in the UK could be facing a ""digital"" Christmas - which is what people in Scotland could be facingafter a warning from the clinical director there. Sir Patrick says some level of restrictions will need to be in place ""for a while"" to get case numbers down, but progress is already being seen in some areas of the country. ""A lot depends on what happens now over the next few weeks,"" he adds, insisting the situation must be closely monitored. Yvonne in Surrey asks what would happen to the supply chain in the event of a national or local lockdown. She wants to know what financial help would be available to cover the costs of wages to businesses which have not been specifically told to close but have had a drop in income, due to other businesses in their supply chain being told to close. The PM says No 10 is ""doing everything we can"" to support businesses through the crisis and outlines some of the support and relief measures in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak adds that businesses told to close will be able to get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month for the length of closure and the wages of staff will be paid at two thirds. He adds there are support measures in place for businesses not told to close, announced earlier today. Now onto questions. Liam from Bradford asks how the government will encourage innovative businesses. Boris Johnson replies that business rates are ""unprecedentedly low"". And he adds that the government is investing in skills. Rishi Sunak also points to  government schemes to invest in start-up funds. Sir Patrick Vallance now talks through the government slides. He says the number of infections and people being admitted into hospital are continuing to rise. He adds that the more patients there are with Covid, the more pressure on the healthcare system overall. He says the R rate is growing but is still half of the natural R rate of three - and that this reflects ""the huge effort people have made to adhere to the measures in place"" such as wearing masks and washing hands. ""But the epidemic is still growing,"" he adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister's opening contribution to the news conference was a familiar one. The messy reality of a regional approach in England - with rules different here from they are there - represents a pragmatic approach to the pandemic, he claims. Why? The two alternatives, Boris Johnson argues, would be worse: lockdown, or letting the virus rip. It is a longstanding technique in political speech writing to paint your opponents as occupying relatively extreme positions either side of your own. But in this instance is also the crux of the government's argument: seemingly arbitrary rules, changing rapidly and varying geographically, might seem baffling, but they're better, or less worse, than doing anything else.

As we bring our live coverage to a close, here's a final roundup of today's key developments in the UK: Take a look at our charts with the latest on coronavirus in the UK - including a map of the local authorities with extra restrictions in place and the most recent data on the number of positive cases.  Gavin BevisBBC News Nottingham's seven-day coronavirus infection rate has fallen again. The latest figure - reflecting cases for the week to 19 October - is 561.4 per 100,000 people, down from 604.5 yesterday. Nottingham now has the fifth highest rate in England, behind Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Rossendale and Liverpool. The city and county of Nottinghamshire are still waiting to hear whether they will be made subject to tier three restrictions in the coming days. A meeting between local leaders and a government minister was due to take place at 16:30. During his coronavirus briefing, televised live on BBC One this afternoon, Boris Johnson said he wanted to travel ""a middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus"". Scylla is a monster from Greek mythology who lived on a rock. While Charybdis refers to a nearby deadly whirlpool. Heroic figures such as Odysseus would have to pick a careful course between the two foes to avoid being eaten or drowned.

Two in five children aged 11 to 16 in England feel the coronavirus lockdown has made their lives worse,an NHS report on mental health suggests. They said their biggest anxieties were about missing school and family and friends contracting Covid-19. Mental disorders have risen across both genders since 2017. In boys, they rose from 11% to 16% and in girls from 10% to 15%, the report found. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, described the increase as ""extremely alarming"" and called for a properly-funded children's mental health service and for every school to have its own NHS-funded counsellor. The report is based on a survey of 3,570 children and young people up to the age of 22 who were interviewed in 2017 and followed up online in July during the coronavirus pandemic. Responding to questions about whether West Yorkshire could move into tier three, a statement just issued by Leeds City Council says: âWe are awaiting further talks with government regarding restrictions that are in place to tackle coronavirus in Leeds. ""At this current time we are not expecting tier status to change in Leeds this week.â Earlier today the government said discussions with West Yorkshire (Bradford, Leeds, Kirklees, Calderdale, Wakefield) about moving to the very high alert level were ongoing. Rishi Sunak has given an interview to explain the new measures he is taking to adapt his Winter Economic Plan, reflecting new regional restrictions in England. ""I've always said that we would need to adapt our
financial support as the situation evolves,"" he said. ""That's why today we're
announcing three measures that will ensure that we can protect more jobs and
support more businesses through the difficult winter months ahead."" Mr Sunak added he has always said he would ""adapt and evolve our support as the health situation
changes and that's clearly what's happened over the past few weeks"". Employers, he said, ""believe in the principle that this is a shared
endeavour that they want to support their employees alongside the government
and taxpayer, and they think it's right that employees are doing some work"". He ends with a message to people in England: ""Whether you're in a tier two
area [or a] tier three area, we've got support in place for you on a national basis"". A timely reminder as to the reason why you are seeing the prime minister and the chanellor together addressing BBC One viewers in the afternoon. The latest daily update shows the UK recorded another 21,242 coronavirus cases according to thegovernment's dashboard,external, while a further 189 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. The Spanish Canary Islands, the Maldives, Denmark and the Greek island of Mykonos have been added to the UK's list of travel corridors, the transport secretary has announced. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said people returning from these destinations from 04.00 BST on Sunday will no longer need to self-isolate for two weeks. However, Liechtenstein has become the only country to lose its exemption this week, meaning people returning from the country will need to quarantine on their return. Allow Twitter content?

Lastly, Jane Kirby of the Press Association asked Sir Patrick Vallance if a decent level of roll-out of a potential vaccine is achieved by next spring, how soon people might be able to stop social distancing and wearing face coverings. She asked the PM if he would reconsider his opposition to a national circuit break - a short, sharp lockdown - if those in Northern Ireland and Wales are shown to be more effective than tier three restrictions in England. Sir Patrick replies first, insisting he will not speculate on how effective the vaccines are going to be, but says once we know how effective they are, it could be determined ""how to use them best"". ""Clearly the aim of vaccination is to try to take most of the load of the infection spread onto the vaccine in order to be able to relieve other measures and that's got to be an aim we would all wish for,"" he adds. The PM said a national circuit break would be ""very damaging"" economically, socially and mentally for the country. ""We do think the local measures are right, and I repeat my gratitude to local leadership across the country, people who are helping to get the R rate down across their neighbourhoods... and that's what we're going to continue with."" Chris Smyth from the Times asked if the level of financial help will be available until a vaccine is in widespread use. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Job Support Scheme will last for at least six months through to the spring with a review point halfway through. Boris Johnson said ""billions more is going in to support jobs and livelihoods"" but adds ""we are going to have to pay this money back"". He said the government's objective is to keep the economy going so ""the UK can bounce back"". Smyth also asked if the test and trace scheme can still keep up with rising cases. Boris Johnson replied that there are ""interesting testing technologies"" being developed but added ""for the moment we have to use the tools we've got"". On vaccines, Sir Patrick said ""things are progressing well"" but suggest ""the widespread use of vaccines isn't going to be until spring next year"". Richard Partington of the Guardian asks the PM and the chancellor why the government was prepared to ""go to the wall"" over Â£5m with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham during the tier three negotiations, when they were preparing to announce ""billions of pounds"" more support in today's expansion. Boris Johnson says the negotiations between regional leaders and the government was ""all about fairness"" and making sure ""everybody got the same package"". He said No 10 is looking to address the national picture now and change with the evolving virus situation. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks if today's financial measures are an acknowledgement that ""you were not supporting parts of the north of England properly during the summer"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak replies: ""We want people to have equal support wherever they are."" Rigby also asks Sir Patrick Vallance if he is disappointed that the test and trace scheme is reaching less than 60% of contacts. ""It is very clear there is room for improvement,"" says Sir Patrick. He adds that the ""effectiveness of test and trace is less when the case numbers are high"". Ben Kentish of LBC asks about the latest NHS test and trace figures which showed that just 15% of coronavirus test results were returned within 24 hours. Boris Johnson says he ""shares peoples' frustrations"" and acknowledged the need to improve the situation to get faster turnaround times. He defends the achievements of the scheme as ""colossal"", including the expansion of testing capacity, adding that the ""technology is improving the whole time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income."" She also asks Sir Patrick Vallance about whether people elsewhere in the UK could be facing a ""digital"" Christmas - which is what people in Scotland could be facingafter a warning from the clinical director there. Sir Patrick says some level of restrictions will need to be in place ""for a while"" to get case numbers down, but progress is already being seen in some areas of the country. ""A lot depends on what happens now over the next few weeks,"" he adds, insisting the situation must be closely monitored. Yvonne in Surrey asks what would happen to the supply chain in the event of a national or local lockdown. She wants to know what financial help would be available to cover the costs of wages to businesses which have not been specifically told to close but have had a drop in income, due to other businesses in their supply chain being told to close. The PM says No 10 is ""doing everything we can"" to support businesses through the crisis and outlines some of the support and relief measures in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak adds that businesses told to close will be able to get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month for the length of closure and the wages of staff will be paid at two thirds. He adds there are support measures in place for businesses not told to close, announced earlier today. Now onto questions. Liam from Bradford asks how the government will encourage innovative businesses. Boris Johnson replies that business rates are ""unprecedentedly low"". And he adds that the government is investing in skills. Rishi Sunak also points to  government schemes to invest in start-up funds. Sir Patrick Vallance now talks through the government slides. He says the number of infections and people being admitted into hospital are continuing to rise. He adds that the more patients there are with Covid, the more pressure on the healthcare system overall. He says the R rate is growing but is still half of the natural R rate of three - and that this reflects ""the huge effort people have made to adhere to the measures in place"" such as wearing masks and washing hands. ""But the epidemic is still growing,"" he adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister's opening contribution to the news conference was a familiar one. The messy reality of a regional approach in England - with rules different here from they are there - represents a pragmatic approach to the pandemic, he claims. Why? The two alternatives, Boris Johnson argues, would be worse: lockdown, or letting the virus rip. It is a longstanding technique in political speech writing to paint your opponents as occupying relatively extreme positions either side of your own. But in this instance is also the crux of the government's argument: seemingly arbitrary rules, changing rapidly and varying geographically, might seem baffling, but they're better, or less worse, than doing anything else.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income."" She also asks Sir Patrick Vallance about whether people elsewhere in the UK could be facing a ""digital"" Christmas - which is what people in Scotland could be facingafter a warning from the clinical director there. Sir Patrick says some level of restrictions will need to be in place ""for a while"" to get case numbers down, but progress is already being seen in some areas of the country. ""A lot depends on what happens now over the next few weeks,"" he adds, insisting the situation must be closely monitored. Yvonne in Surrey asks what would happen to the supply chain in the event of a national or local lockdown. She wants to know what financial help would be available to cover the costs of wages to businesses which have not been specifically told to close but have had a drop in income, due to other businesses in their supply chain being told to close. The PM says No 10 is ""doing everything we can"" to support businesses through the crisis and outlines some of the support and relief measures in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak adds that businesses told to close will be able to get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month for the length of closure and the wages of staff will be paid at two thirds. He adds there are support measures in place for businesses not told to close, announced earlier today. Now onto questions. Liam from Bradford asks how the government will encourage innovative businesses. Boris Johnson replies that business rates are ""unprecedentedly low"". And he adds that the government is investing in skills. Rishi Sunak also points to  government schemes to invest in start-up funds. Sir Patrick Vallance now talks through the government slides. He says the number of infections and people being admitted into hospital are continuing to rise. He adds that the more patients there are with Covid, the more pressure on the healthcare system overall. He says the R rate is growing but is still half of the natural R rate of three - and that this reflects ""the huge effort people have made to adhere to the measures in place"" such as wearing masks and washing hands. ""But the epidemic is still growing,"" he adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister's opening contribution to the news conference was a familiar one. The messy reality of a regional approach in England - with rules different here from they are there - represents a pragmatic approach to the pandemic, he claims. Why? The two alternatives, Boris Johnson argues, would be worse: lockdown, or letting the virus rip. It is a longstanding technique in political speech writing to paint your opponents as occupying relatively extreme positions either side of your own. But in this instance is also the crux of the government's argument: seemingly arbitrary rules, changing rapidly and varying geographically, might seem baffling, but they're better, or less worse, than doing anything else.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the testing system in England must improve, but defends its capacity as ""colossal"" He holds a briefing alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance Further support for workers in parts of England under tier two restrictions are announced by the chancellor Under the new Job Support Scheme the government will fund up to half of the wages of people unable to work their full hours Firms in affected areas will also be eligible for cash grants of up to Â£2,100 a month Stoke, Coventry and Slough will be moved into tier 2 Covid restrictions Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s - who was the country's prime minister until last month - admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 Greater Manchester will enter tier three restrictions just after midnight Edited by John Hand We are pausing our live coverage for today, thank you for joining us. We will resume our coverage tomorrow morning. As we bring our live coverage to a close, here's a final roundup of today's key developments in the UK: Take a look at our charts with the latest on coronavirus in the UK - including a map of the local authorities with extra restrictions in place and the most recent data on the number of positive cases.  Gavin BevisBBC News Nottingham's seven-day coronavirus infection rate has fallen again. The latest figure - reflecting cases for the week to 19 October - is 561.4 per 100,000 people, down from 604.5 yesterday. Nottingham now has the fifth highest rate in England, behind Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Rossendale and Liverpool. The city and county of Nottinghamshire are still waiting to hear whether they will be made subject to tier three restrictions in the coming days. A meeting between local leaders and a government minister was due to take place at 16:30. During his coronavirus briefing, televised live on BBC One this afternoon, Boris Johnson said he wanted to travel ""a middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus"". Scylla is a monster from Greek mythology who lived on a rock. While Charybdis refers to a nearby deadly whirlpool. Heroic figures such as Odysseus would have to pick a careful course between the two foes to avoid being eaten or drowned.

Two in five children aged 11 to 16 in England feel the coronavirus lockdown has made their lives worse,an NHS report on mental health suggests. They said their biggest anxieties were about missing school and family and friends contracting Covid-19. Mental disorders have risen across both genders since 2017. In boys, they rose from 11% to 16% and in girls from 10% to 15%, the report found. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, described the increase as ""extremely alarming"" and called for a properly-funded children's mental health service and for every school to have its own NHS-funded counsellor. The report is based on a survey of 3,570 children and young people up to the age of 22 who were interviewed in 2017 and followed up online in July during the coronavirus pandemic. Responding to questions about whether West Yorkshire could move into tier three, a statement just issued by Leeds City Council says: âWe are awaiting further talks with government regarding restrictions that are in place to tackle coronavirus in Leeds. ""At this current time we are not expecting tier status to change in Leeds this week.â Earlier today the government said discussions with West Yorkshire (Bradford, Leeds, Kirklees, Calderdale, Wakefield) about moving to the very high alert level were ongoing. Rishi Sunak has given an interview to explain the new measures he is taking to adapt his Winter Economic Plan, reflecting new regional restrictions in England. ""I've always said that we would need to adapt our
financial support as the situation evolves,"" he said. ""That's why today we're
announcing three measures that will ensure that we can protect more jobs and
support more businesses through the difficult winter months ahead."" Mr Sunak added he has always said he would ""adapt and evolve our support as the health situation
changes and that's clearly what's happened over the past few weeks"". Employers, he said, ""believe in the principle that this is a shared
endeavour that they want to support their employees alongside the government
and taxpayer, and they think it's right that employees are doing some work"". He ends with a message to people in England: ""Whether you're in a tier two
area [or a] tier three area, we've got support in place for you on a national basis"". A timely reminder as to the reason why you are seeing the prime minister and the chanellor together addressing BBC One viewers in the afternoon. The latest daily update shows the UK recorded another 21,242 coronavirus cases according to thegovernment's dashboard,external, while a further 189 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. The Spanish Canary Islands, the Maldives, Denmark and the Greek island of Mykonos have been added to the UK's list of travel corridors, the transport secretary has announced. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said people returning from these destinations from 04.00 BST on Sunday will no longer need to self-isolate for two weeks. However, Liechtenstein has become the only country to lose its exemption this week, meaning people returning from the country will need to quarantine on their return. Allow Twitter content?

Lastly, Jane Kirby of the Press Association asked Sir Patrick Vallance if a decent level of roll-out of a potential vaccine is achieved by next spring, how soon people might be able to stop social distancing and wearing face coverings. She asked the PM if he would reconsider his opposition to a national circuit break - a short, sharp lockdown - if those in Northern Ireland and Wales are shown to be more effective than tier three restrictions in England. Sir Patrick replies first, insisting he will not speculate on how effective the vaccines are going to be, but says once we know how effective they are, it could be determined ""how to use them best"". ""Clearly the aim of vaccination is to try to take most of the load of the infection spread onto the vaccine in order to be able to relieve other measures and that's got to be an aim we would all wish for,"" he adds. The PM said a national circuit break would be ""very damaging"" economically, socially and mentally for the country. ""We do think the local measures are right, and I repeat my gratitude to local leadership across the country, people who are helping to get the R rate down across their neighbourhoods... and that's what we're going to continue with."" Chris Smyth from the Times asked if the level of financial help will be available until a vaccine is in widespread use. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Job Support Scheme will last for at least six months through to the spring with a review point halfway through. Boris Johnson said ""billions more is going in to support jobs and livelihoods"" but adds ""we are going to have to pay this money back"". He said the government's objective is to keep the economy going so ""the UK can bounce back"". Smyth also asked if the test and trace scheme can still keep up with rising cases. Boris Johnson replied that there are ""interesting testing technologies"" being developed but added ""for the moment we have to use the tools we've got"". On vaccines, Sir Patrick said ""things are progressing well"" but suggest ""the widespread use of vaccines isn't going to be until spring next year"". Richard Partington of the Guardian asks the PM and the chancellor why the government was prepared to ""go to the wall"" over Â£5m with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham during the tier three negotiations, when they were preparing to announce ""billions of pounds"" more support in today's expansion. Boris Johnson says the negotiations between regional leaders and the government was ""all about fairness"" and making sure ""everybody got the same package"". He said No 10 is looking to address the national picture now and change with the evolving virus situation. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks if today's financial measures are an acknowledgement that ""you were not supporting parts of the north of England properly during the summer"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak replies: ""We want people to have equal support wherever they are."" Rigby also asks Sir Patrick Vallance if he is disappointed that the test and trace scheme is reaching less than 60% of contacts. ""It is very clear there is room for improvement,"" says Sir Patrick. He adds that the ""effectiveness of test and trace is less when the case numbers are high"". Ben Kentish of LBC asks about the latest NHS test and trace figures which showed that just 15% of coronavirus test results were returned within 24 hours. Boris Johnson says he ""shares peoples' frustrations"" and acknowledged the need to improve the situation to get faster turnaround times. He defends the achievements of the scheme as ""colossal"", including the expansion of testing capacity, adding that the ""technology is improving the whole time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income.""

"KeolisAmey has run Transport for Wales rail services since October 2018 The Transport for Wales rail service is to be brought under Welsh Government control from next February. Ministers have confirmed the takeover from KeolisAmey, with day-to-day services to be run by a publicly-owned company. It follows significant falls in passenger numbers during the pandemic. The Welsh Tories questioned how much nationalisation will cost taxpayers, while Plaid Cymru called for the Senedd to be recalled. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the government had stepped in ""to stabilise the network and keep it running"". ""The last few months have been extremely challenging for public transport in Wales and across the UK. Covid has significantly impacted passenger revenues,"" he said. TfW rail customers 'among least satisfied in UK' Rail boss urges patience after first year KeolisAmey was awarded the franchise in 2018, taking over from Arriva Trains Wales. It covers most of Wales' trains - including key commuter services such as the Valley Lines. Transport for Wales will run Wales and Borders services from February The financial risk of the Wales and Borders rail franchise, which is branded Transport for Wales (TfW), had already been taken over by taxpayers under aÂ£65m agreement,externalsigned in May. But from February next year KeolisAmey staff working on rail services will be transferred over to a publicly owned company, currently called Transport for Wales Rail Ltd. It is happening under a part of railway law that allows for the creation of operators of ""last resort"". Officials say the time gap between now and the start of the new operator will allow the Welsh Government to prepare the new operator for service. A part of the original agreement is staying - Amey Keolis Infrastructure Ltd will continue to be responsible for infrastructure on the Core Valley Lines, where the South Wales Metro upgrade is taking place. Keolis and Amey will also work with the Welsh Government quango Transport for Wales on improvements to the service - like rolling stock and ticketing. Kevin Thomas, chief executive of KeolisAmey Wales, said: ""In light of Covid-19, we recognise the need for Welsh Government to have a sustainable way forward for delivering its ambitious objectives for rail."" KeolisAmey took over from Arriva Trains Wales in 2018 Challenged on the decision later on Thursday, Mr Skates told a Senedd committee that if the existing arrangements had continued it would have ""led to a collapse by the operator and a catastrophic transfer then to the operator of last resort [Transport for Wales Rail Ltd]. ""What we're able to do now is manage a careful transition, which will take us through to February, and then beyond, with the establishment of TfW rail limited,"" he said. Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters said: ""The whole business model collapsed in the face of Covid because the revenue was not coming in and Keolis in effect were not prepared to shoulder their share of the pain."" Asked about the long-term costs of propping up the network, he said: ""It depends on Covid. We don't know."" Ministers pledged to honour commitments worth more than Â£1bn to buy new trains and build the south Wales Metro. ""That will be delivered,"" Mr Skates said. James Price, chief executive of Welsh Government quango Transport for Wales which oversaw the franchise and shared branding with it, said that rolling stock is ""on the way"" and ""in essence is paid for already"". ""What this allows us to do is to reduce the profit we pay to the private sector massively over time, and make sure that when the revenue comes back, it comes back in to the taxpayer."" Russell George, economy spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Given the track record of the Welsh Labour-led Government, its decision to take control of our vital train industry has not filled me with any hope."" He said ministers should have consulted the Senedd on ""how much this decision is going to cost the Welsh taxpayer"". ""Eyebrows will be raised, too, on why any support is being left until February 2021,"" Mr George added. Plaid Cymru transport spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said it ""could well be the right decision"", saying her party ""has always maintained that our railways should be brought into public hands and the government put passengers before profit"". But she said there were ""crucial questions"" on financial implications and the nature of the subsidiary. ""Decisions of this importance should be announced in the Senedd so that members can ask questions on behalf of the people of Wales,"" she said. KeolisAmey already runs the Docklands Light Railway in London KeolisAmey is a joint-venture between two European companies, andwas awarded the Wales and Borders franchise in May 2018in a Â£5bn contract. It was the first time the Welsh Government had awarded the franchise. Keolis is France's largest private sector public transport operator - but its major shareholder is state-owned French railway SNCF. Amey is a former one-time UK company owned by Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial. KeolisAmey took over services in October 2018. In January it emerged it had beenfined Â£3.4m over the performance of services. Rail unions backed the move. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""There is huge public support for public ownership because privatisation and profiteering has never been an efficient way to provide value for money, and this is even more the case when extra funding has been needed during the coronavirus pandemic."" Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA, said: ""This is a welcome and positive step from the Welsh Government, which will put our railways back in public hands and again shows the abject failure of privatisation."" We are told passengers will not notice the changeover. The same trains, staffed by the same drivers and conductors, will arrive at platforms. But there are new risks for the taxpayer. Ticket sales have plummeted. So in May the Welsh Government announced Â£65m and an emergency agreement to help the service cope. In practice, that means almost all the financial risks associated with the railway are borne by the government. Profits and losses have moved from the private sector into the public sector.

"Playa De Las Teresitas in Tenerife UK tourists seeking winter sun have been given a boost, after Spain's Canary Islands and the Maldives were added to the government's safe travel list. It means visitors will no longer need to quarantine for 14 days on their return, with the Greek island of Mykonos and Denmark also deemed safe. The changes apply to anyone arriving in the UK after 04:00 BST on Sunday. But Liechtenstein has been taken off the list, so arrivals must isolate. The changes apply to citizens from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The Canary Islands are popular with winter holidaymakers, being one of the few parts of Europe warm enough for beach holidays at that time. However, the rest of Spain, including the Balearic Islands, remain subject to quarantine restrictions amid a surge in infections. Beyond having to fill in passenger locator forms, visitors to the Canaries and Mykonos currently face no restrictions to entry. Which countries can I still go on holiday to? First UK airport coronavirus testing begins But all visitors to the Maldives are required to prove they have had a negative Covid test within 96 hours of arrival. And any UK citizen visiting Denmark must prove they have a""worthy purpose"" for visiting,external, such as work or study, as Denmark deems Britain to be a high risk country. Tourism is not considered a worthy purpose, although people with second homes in the country may visit. The Department for Transport said the new additions to the safe list had seen a decrease in confirmed cases of coronavirus. However, it said ""a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Liechtenstein"" had led to it being removed from the current list of ""travel corridors"". After so much doom and gloom, travel companies can suddenly see the sunshine. The Canaries are a key destination for UK airlines and tour operators. And it is not an exaggeration to say that the removal of the quarantine will help these companies make it through the winter. The government has, in effect, dialled-up the tourism ""on switch"". However it will be a real test case for whether, in these uncertain Covid times, there is demand for travel. With plenty of time for people to make winter bookings it's a timely moment. British Airways recently scheduled a direct flight to the Maldives, so maybe they knew something we didn't. Travel companies, which have seen demand slump due to the quarantine rules, welcomed the decision on the Canaries. ""The Canaries are a hugely important market for winter travel - representing over 50% of bookings for some tour operators - so this is very welcome news for the whole sector,"" said industry body Airlines UK. Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI, said the holiday operator had not been able to take people on a holiday to the Canaries for 89 days. ""We're therefore delighted that UK flights will now resume from Saturday 24 October. The first flights will depart to Fuerteventura and Lanzarote this weekend, with many more added in the coming days."" There are now only a handful of places travellers from the UK can visit without facing restrictions - either when they arrive at their destination, or return. There are hopescoronavirus testing for passengerscould make travel to more destinations possible, by providing proof of a negative result before travellers leave the UK. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, meanwhile, has said he is""hopeful"" a new testing regime for arrivals to Britain can be in place by 1 December, reducing the amount of time people need to spend in quarantine. However, new British Airways boss Sean Doyle last week called for tests for returning Britons before departure, warning the UK would ""get left behind"" without more radical action. Earlier on Mondaythe airline cut flight numbers again, saying it would operate fewer planes than planned for the rest of the year as the pandemic continues to hit demand. The Foreign Office still advises British nationals against all but essential international travel due to the pandemic. Which countries can you now travel to from the UK?

"Ticketing site Viagogo may need to sell all or part of StubHub after an investigation by the UK's competition watchdog found the merger of the two firms could lead to higher fees. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal would reduce competition as the two firms have a combined market share of more than 90%. Viagogo bought StubHub in February for $4.1bn (Â£3.1bn). Viagogo said it would work with the CMA to find a solution. The CMA's findings are from its provisional report. Its final report is due in December. ""The evidence we've seen so far consistently points in the same direction - that Viagogo and StubHub have a market share of more than 90% combined and compete closely with each other,"" said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the CMA inquiry group. ""We are therefore concerned that their merger could lead to secondary ticketing customers facing higher fees and lower quality services. The CMA said its concerns would be addressed by a full sale of StubHub, while a partial sale would have to include ""at least the assets and operations of either StubHub or Viagogo that cover the relevant market - the supply of uncapped secondary ticketing platform services for the resale of tickets to UK events"". The watchdog added:  ""The CMA is mindful of the significant impact that the coronavirus (Covid-19) is currently having on the live events industry. ""However, the evidence is that Viagogo and StubHub would remain important competitors for the foreseeable future without the merger."" A spokesperson for Viagogo said: ""Whilst we disagree with the provisional conclusion that the deal would reduce competition, we look forward to working with the CMA to deliver a comprehensive solution which addresses their concerns."" This is not the first time Viagogo has come under the eye of the competition watchdog. Last year, Viagogo dodged CMA legal action after improvingwhat it tells customers about tickets, including seating information and whether the venue had banned ticket resales. The CMA welcomed the changes but criticised the site's slowness to respond. This summer, Viagogo wascriticised for refusing to give refundsto people who had bought tickets on its site to events hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Consumer organisation Which? said the ticketing site had added a clause to its cancellation policy which had left some customers unable to claim their money back. But Viagogo said the claim was ""fundamentally inaccurate"" since their policy on refunding customers had not changed. Viagogo denies withholding refunds Viagogo buys rival StubHub in $4bn deal Viagogo's StubHub deal faces competition probe California's fire death toll doubles as chaos grips the city What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Who joined Demi as a big winner at the Golden Globes?

"Non-essential business in Wales are being told to shut on Friday evening Business leaders say companies in Wales have been given just hours to finalise plans for the firebreak lockdown. All non-essential businesses will have to shut for two weeks from 18:00 BST on Friday. But the list of the types of business being forced to closewas only published on Thursday morning,external. The Welsh Government said there was only a ""small window"" to act to slow the spread of coronavirus and there were ""no easy options"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the Welsh Government had left it ""far too late in the day"" to provide the detailed information. ""Waiting until the day before the lockdown comes into force does not give businesses the time that they need to prepare,"" said Ben Francis, the FSB Wales policy chair. ""This week should have been spent engaging with staff, contacting suppliers and informing customers, but many firms simply spent this time in the dark."" Wales lockdown: What can you do? Why Wales has gone down the firebreak route Covid: Breaking the circuit The federation said it was still fielding questions from its members in Wales who are worried about what they need to do to comply with the lockdown ""Welsh Government needs to take steps to be more responsive to the needs of the business community as we move through the coming weeks, or they risk making an already difficult period even worse for the business community,"" added Mr Francis. The 46-page document setting out the legal rules behind the firebreak lists the type of businesses that must shut, those that can remain open but with limited access, and those that can continue to trade. The FSB said many will be ""incredibly relieved"" to have the rules in black-and-white. Homeware stores Nail, beauty or tanning salons, tattoo and piercing parlours Hair salons and barbers Auction houses Car dealers Betting shops Garden centres and nurseries Shopping centres, arcades and markets Cinemas Theatres Nightclubs and live music venues Bingo halls and casinos Leisure centres, swimming pools, gyms and spas Museums and galleries Funfairs, amusement and theme parks Visitor attractions Libraries Estate or letting agents and show homes Conference and event venues It is last orders again for pubs and bars Pubs, restaurants and cafes must close for consumption on the premises but takeaway food sales are allowed. Holiday and camping sites, along with hotels and B&Bs, holiday apartments and hostels must also shut - unless a resident cannot move elsewhere, or it is their permanent residence. Places of worship can only open for wedding vows or funerals, and crematoriums for funerals. Food retailers, including food markets, supermarkets, convenience stores, and off-licences Canteens in prisons or military use Hospital and educational libraries Newsagents Building and hardware stores Pharmacies Bicycle shops Petrol stations Car repair and MoT services Taxi or vehicle hire businesses Banks, building societies and credit unions Post offices Laundrettes and dry cleaners Dental services, opticians, audiology services, chiropody, chiropractors, osteopaths and other medical or health services Veterinary surgeons and pet shops Agricultural supplies Livestock markets Funeral directors But there has also been some disquiet expressed by some sectors. The Horticultural Trades Association, which represents businesses such as garden centres, said it was disappointed to learn those areas must shut. ""Back in May, Wales was the first UK administration to take the decision to reopen garden centres and we expected this to be a sign of support for the industry,"" said James Barnes, chair of the association. ""With no evidence to show why garden centres should be closed, we were crushed to see them included yet again as 'non-essential retail' for this Friday's lockdown."" Bangor has witnessed a series of closures including clothing retailer Peacocks, which has gone into administration Traders in Bangor plan on voicing their concerns over the Covid restrictions on Thursday by protesting outside their shops on what is Wales' longest high street. Most of the city has been under a local lockdown since 10 October, following a spike in coronavirus cases. ""Local businesses have seen a huge drop in trade, they've stayed open while customers are being instructed to stay way,"" said Danielle Asquith, who works at a tattoo parlour. ""The message is simple, allow us to work to normal capacity or fund our temporary closure. It is simply not viable to continue the way things are."" Responding to business concerns across Wales, a Welsh Government official said: ""There are no easy options and we recognise this firebreak period will have an impact on businesses at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. ""We have doubled the third phase of the Economic Resilience Fund, making nearly Â£300 million available to support businesses. This phase will open next week and we will work hard to get money out to businesses as quickly as we can."" What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales?

"Michel Barnier resumed talks on Friday after arriving in the UK on Thursday evening. Talks over a post-Brexit trade deal have resumed in London, after negotiators returned to the table following a week-long standoff. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss insisted a deal can still be done with the EU, as officials began a new round of ""intensified"" daily talks. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that ""every day counts"" ahead of a looming December deadline. He said both sides share a ""huge common responsibility"" as talks restarted. Negotiations stalled last week after a summit in Brussels where EU leaderscalled on the UKto ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. But the UK side agreed to resume talks after Mr Barnier said ""compromises on both sides"" were needed, in a speech on Wednesday. UK 'ready to welcome EU' to continue trade talks Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. Key areas of disagreement include fishing rights, post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. Speaking after the UKformally signedits post-Brexit trade deal with Japan, Ms Truss said the UK also wanted to strike a ""good deal with the EU"". ""We're in intense negotiations with the EU. We've made real progress,"" she told reporters on Friday. In an interview with the BBC, she added any agreement would have to be based ""on the principle that the UK is a sovereign nation"". At a signing ceremony in Tokyo, Japan's foreign minister also called on the EU and UK to reach a deal, which he said was important to Japanese firms. Arriving in the UK on Thursday, ahead of a meeting with UK counterpart Lord David Frost, Mr Barnier told reporters it was ""important to be back at the table"". The pair will meet again on Friday, during an ""initial"" renewed negotiation round running until Sunday, with subsequent talks planned in both Brussels and London. These later talks could either take place in person or be held via video link if Covid restrictions apply, if both sides agree. In line with a demand made by the UK, both sides will resume talks on all subjects based on proposed legal texts prepared by officials. Theyhave also agreed,externalthat ""nothing is agreed"" until progress has been reached in all areas - which has been a key demand of the EU. You could be forgiven for thinking that what we've witnessed over the past few days is a bit of political theatre. Cover for the government - post chest-beating- to return to the negotiating table where they know the time has now come for tough compromises to be made. EU leaders also went out of their way to sound tough on Brexit at their summit last week. Privately, a number of EU figures now admit it was a misstep. But EU leaders play to the domestic gallery too. They wanted to show they were ""standing up to the UK"" - that leaving the EU doesn't pay and that EU interests would be defended. Read more from Katya here The two sides have been at odds over the issue of so-called ""state aid"" rules, which limit government help for industry in the name of ensuring fair economic competition. The UK has rejected an EU demand made earlier in the year for it to continue following the bloc's rules on such subsidies as part of a trade agreement. Lord Frost has suggested the UK could instead agree ""principles"" for how subsidies are spent - something welcomed by Mr Barnier on Wednesday. The two sides are also haggling over how much European fishing boats should be able to catch in British waters from next year. The EU has so far resisted UK demands for annual talks to decide stock limits, as well as a reduction in access for its vessels to British fishing grounds. By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization. YOUR WORK, YOUR MONEY:Is my bar business better off in Tier 3?

"Demand in pubs and restaurants has collapsed after bans on households mixing were introduced in many areas Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to unveil new support for workers and firms hit by restrictions imposed as coronavirus cases rise across the UK. He is due to update the Job Support Scheme, which replaces furlough in November, in the Commons on Thursday. Critics say not enough is being done for firms in tier two areas that have seen demand collapse without being formally required to shut. In tier three areas, firms ordered to shut get emergency support. Talks were held throughout Wednesday, with the government said to have acknowledged that while there are three tiers of alert level - medium, high, and very high - there are only two tiers of support. Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What is changing after furlough? What Covid tier is my area in? Alert system explained... with cake Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, have complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions. They argue that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. Top London-based chef Yotam Ottolenghi said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"". ""We are on our knees now,"" he told the BBC. ""We just don't have customers coming through the door."" He said that before tier two restrictions were imposed in London, his restaurants were operating at 50% of capacity, but that this had now fallen to between 10% and 20%. ""This is just not a viable place for a restaurant to be,"" he said, describing tier two as a ""cursed"" category that ""deprives us of oxygen"". In tier three areas, the government will pay 67% of affected workers' wages, up to Â£2,100 a month, from 1 November (""lockdown Job Support Scheme"" in the chart below). Some workers can also claimUniversal Credit. But in tier two regions, the only help available will be the standard JSS (""part-time Job Support Scheme"" in the chart below), which is more costly for employers. Business groups and unions say this means many firms will not be able to use it and will have to lay off workers instead. The chancellor's spokesperson said: ""What we have always said is that our package of support is always flexible, and always up for review, to make sure that it is dealing with the situation as it evolves."" Areas in tier two - the second-highest risk level - include London, Essex, much of the West Midlands, Leicester, Nottinghamshire, Cheshire, West Yorkshire and north-east England. Coventry is to move to tier two Covid restrictions from midnight on Friday, the city council has said. In addition to national restrictions meaning pubs and restaurants must close by 22:00, people in tier two areas are banned from mixing with other households indoors - hammering demand in many leisure industries. Key Conservative figures, such as West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, have been critical of the disparities, along with a raft of Labour local leaders and MPs. Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was ""one of the oddities of the system"" that pubs and restaurants in tier three areas which had been forced to close were in a better position than those in tier two areas which remained open. ""You get full support, whereas if you're in tier two, you get no more support than similar businesses in the rest of the country and yet demand for your products is clearly massively reduced,"" he added. Mr Johnson said it was clearly right that the government should seek to close that support gap with new measures. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC: ""We have a big distinction between tier one, tier two and tier three restrictions in theory, but the economic support packages don't go alongside those restrictions."" This video can not be played People in Barnsley town centre react to tier three restrictions being announced As more parts of the country are placed in tier two, critics say the standard JSS is likely to fall short, with many fewer firms than expected signing up. Options being discussed in Whitehall include more generous taxpayer wage support for businesses in these regions, up from the current level of 22%, and grants offered through local authorities. With so much of England now in tier two, even small increases in support could end up being very expensive. Business and union leaders will be briefed on the changes on Thursday. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules It comes amid warnings that unemployment could rise as high as 8.5% in the first half of next year without more government support for struggling businesses. In the three months to August,redundancies rose to their highest level since 2009, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The number claiming work-related benefits, meanwhile, hit 2.7 million in September - an increase of 1.5 million since the beginning of the crisis in March.

"Demand in pubs and restaurants has collapsed after bans on households mixing were introduced in many areas The chancellor has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions after growing clamour from firms in tier two areas. Rishi Sunak announced big changes to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) - set to replace furlough in November. He told the Commons that even businesses not forced to shut were facing ""profound economic uncertainty"". Under the revised scheme, employers will pay less and staff can work fewer hours before they qualify. At the same time, the taxpayer subsidy has been doubled. At an afternoon news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the chancellor for introducing measures that ""will protect people's livelihoods"". But he warned that the UK would face ""many thousands more deaths"" if it put the economy before health. Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, had complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions. They argued that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. One prominent chef, Yotam Ottolenghi, had said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"" since tier two restrictions were applied to London, adding: ""We are on our knees now."" In response to such arguments, Mr Sunak has now changed the terms of the JSS. Referring to those businesses, he said: ""It is clear that they require further economic support."" This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules Instead of a minimum requirement of paying 55% of wages for a third of hours, as announced last month at the launch of the Winter Economic Plan, employers will have to pay for a minimum of 20% of usual hours worked, and 5% of hours not worked. The government will now fund 62% of the wages for hours not worked. This more than doubles the maximum payment to Â£1,541.75 a month. In the most generous case, the taxpayer will now go from funding 22% of wages to just under half. Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What will I be paid if work has to close? What Covid tier is my area in? The scheme will, as before, be open to all small businesses and larger businesses that can show an impact on revenues. It is aimed at addressing the gap in support for businesses in tier two restrictions, such as London and Birmingham, but is not explicitly tied to that status, and is available across the UK. Noel Hutchinson, director of Poole-based powerboat experience firm Get Lost Sailing, is one small businessman who is feeling overlooked by the new measures. His firm is in a tier one area and so is not receiving any support, but he is seeing far fewer customers as a result of the virus. ""Whether or not businesses are in tier one, two or three, they are all being massively affected by the virus,"" he says. ""A hospitality and tourism business such as ours depends on out-of-town visitors and these people are no longer travelling. Our bookings have slowed massively."" Mr Hutchinson feels that a national lockdown would serve him better, since any government support would then be distributed across the country. ""It would be better for our industry if the whole country was locked down at once and every business in receipt of a fair proportion of the support packages."" The scheme is UK-wide. However, the system of tiered restrictions in England, which gave rise to the government's newly increased economic support, is not. While England has a three-tier system, Scotland is due to bring in a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The middle three will be ""broadly equivalent"" to the English three, but the Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom and one at the top. Wales is about to enter a two-week national lockdown from 18:00 BST on Friday, while Northern Ireland began a four-week lockdown last Friday. All the devolved nations have been promised extra central government funding so they can award grants at a local level. Almost as soon as the heads of the CBI and the TUC appeared on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street to endorse last month's Winter Economic Plan, there were some doubts about its effectiveness. Business and union leaders were happy that some support for part-time working had been announced - itself a revolution for the UK - but the levels of support fell well short of German-style schemes. In particular, employers faced a hurdle of having to pay at least half of workers' wages. This was not a bug in the system - it was the strategy. The Treasury wanted the scheme to lean into a process of economic restructuring to a post-Covid ""new normal"" and not seek to prevent those changes. But all that was predicated on the pandemic being on the wane and the recovery assured. That has not proven to be the case, and indeed some had spotted that, even at the time of the original plan. This is an acknowledgement of gaps in that scheme and that large swathes of the economy are in survival, not restructure mode. For the chancellor, this is a sign that he will offer the right support at the right time. Others will say that the data was going in this direction a month ago, and that some jobs have unnecessarily been lost. Hospitality businesses gathered at a south London pizza restaurant also told the chancellor of their need for help with rents from landlords - something the Treasury thinks is far more tricky than, for example, mortgage holidays. In Greater Manchester, they will wonder why this wasn't offered to areas that were under strong social restrictions earlier. But this is a significant package worth several billion pounds, recognising the economy clearly needs support now before some inevitable fundamental changes. ""I've always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government's stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months."" Responding to his statement, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds criticised the government for what she said was a ""patchwork of poor ideas, rushed out at the last minute"". She said its approach to support for areas entering tier three had been ""nothing short of shambolic"". In other political reaction, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tweeted that the new measures had not been ""put on the table"" during negotiations with the government this week that failed to agree a Â£65m package of support. ""Honestly, can barely believe what I'm reading here,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The chancellor also announced specific help for hospitality and leisure businesses in tier two areas. English councils will be funded to give monthly grants of up to Â£2,100 to 150,000 hotels, restaurants and B&Bs. Devolved nations will be given the equivalent funding for other nations, under the Barnett Formula. The generosity of the self-employment scheme has also been doubled from 20% to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant now of Â£3,750 over a three-month period. What help are the self-employed getting from government? Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit.

From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Business leaders welcomed the changes, with the CBI employers' group calling it a ""big step towards a more standardised approach"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls described it as ""a hugely generous package of support and very welcome news just when we needed it"". She said the changes to the scheme would ""help to safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs"" and give firms ""a much-enhanced chance of being able to overcome the challenges and survive into 2021"". Adam Marshall from the British Chambers of Commerce said it was a ""significant improvement"" for many struggling businesses. But he added: ""The true test of these reforms will be whether they help businesses on the ground get through the difficult months ahead."" Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, which works to improve the standard of living of low-paid workers, said Mr Sunak had done the right thing by expanding help for companies. ""Doing it earlier, given the obvious flaws, would have saved more jobs, but at least we've got to the right place 10 days ahead of the Job Support Scheme coming into effect,"" he said.

"New trains like these are expected to run between Cheltenham, Cardiff and Maesteg from December The boss of Transport for Wales has admitted he understands passengers' frustration as TfW marks the first year of running the nation's rail services. Overall, 82% of passengers are satisfied, the same as 2018, according to the latest official survey. But travellers reported seeing an improvement in how delays have been dealt with since TfW took over from Arriva Trains Wales. ""We've tried very hard,"" said TfW chief executive James Price. He recognised there was frustration at the pace of change, with operators ""playing catch-up""after damage to trains in last autumn's storms. TfW brought in trains from elsewhere to plug the gaps, although there will be delays in bringing in 10 new four-car trains for the valleys lines. ""We've delivered everything we said we'd deliver, sometimes in a slightly different way, because the mix of rolling stock is different,"" Mr Price said. ""The thing I'd really like to see us focus on is unit availability - and then moving into transforming the network, particularly the Metro, in the coming year."" Rail firm sorry after train leaves 25 seconds early Reality Check: When is a train on time? Wales rail franchise - the timetable for improvements TfW chairman Scott Waddington said: ""There is a lot of expectation out there and rightly so. The service hasn't been where it should be in the past. ""But the scale of project we have is going to take time to deliver properly and effectively."" He appealed for patience and said he was confident people would see ""real change"" over the next four to five years. Christine Boston, Wales director of the Community Transport Association and chairwoman of advocacy body Transport Cymru, said positive steps had been made, but it was not easy, with rural communities to serve too. ""It's a tough job, they got off to a particularly difficult start, they have an extremely broad and challenging remit and public expectation is very, very high. ""I think we have to be realistic, we can't expect transformation in transport overnight."" She said she was ""really disappointed""the Welsh Government was requesting a delay in introducing new regulations to make trains accessible for people with disabilitiesdue to a UK-wide backlog in train orders. Commuter Matthew Marshman - and standing room only on his train into Cardiff But passenger Matthew Marshman, who travels daily from Ebbw Vale to his IT job in Cardiff, said it was ""disheartening"" change had not been felt yet, while fares have gone up. ""It's business as usual for me - no difference in my daily routine, still particularly busy, often late, often limited in carriage numbers. ""We looked forward to change happening and it hasn't happened. Fingers crossed it will be coming soon."" TfW oversees public transport strategy for the Welsh Government and is working in partnership with train operator KeolisAmey,which was awarded the 15-year, Â£5bn contract. Economy and Transport Minister Ken Skates said: ""It's clear that there are significant challenges and this journey will take time, but we have ambitious plans to transform transport across Wales to deliver a fully integrated network, with customers at the heart of everything.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the testing system in England must improve, but defends its capacity as ""colossal"" He holds a briefing alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance Further support for workers in parts of England under tier two restrictions are announced by the chancellor Under the new Job Support Scheme the government will fund up to half of the wages of people unable to work their full hours Firms in affected areas will also be eligible for cash grants of up to Â£2,100 a month Stoke, Coventry and Slough will be moved into tier 2 Covid restrictions Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s - who was the country's prime minister until last month - admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 Greater Manchester will enter tier three restrictions just after midnight Edited by John Hand We are pausing our live coverage for today, thank you for joining us. We will resume our coverage tomorrow morning. As we bring our live coverage to a close, here's a final roundup of today's key developments in the UK: Take a look at our charts with the latest on coronavirus in the UK - including a map of the local authorities with extra restrictions in place and the most recent data on the number of positive cases.  Gavin BevisBBC News Nottingham's seven-day coronavirus infection rate has fallen again. The latest figure - reflecting cases for the week to 19 October - is 561.4 per 100,000 people, down from 604.5 yesterday. Nottingham now has the fifth highest rate in England, behind Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Rossendale and Liverpool. The city and county of Nottinghamshire are still waiting to hear whether they will be made subject to tier three restrictions in the coming days. A meeting between local leaders and a government minister was due to take place at 16:30. During his coronavirus briefing, televised live on BBC One this afternoon, Boris Johnson said he wanted to travel ""a middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus"". Scylla is a monster from Greek mythology who lived on a rock. While Charybdis refers to a nearby deadly whirlpool. Heroic figures such as Odysseus would have to pick a careful course between the two foes to avoid being eaten or drowned.

Two in five children aged 11 to 16 in England feel the coronavirus lockdown has made their lives worse,an NHS report on mental health suggests. They said their biggest anxieties were about missing school and family and friends contracting Covid-19. Mental disorders have risen across both genders since 2017. In boys, they rose from 11% to 16% and in girls from 10% to 15%, the report found. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, described the increase as ""extremely alarming"" and called for a properly-funded children's mental health service and for every school to have its own NHS-funded counsellor. The report is based on a survey of 3,570 children and young people up to the age of 22 who were interviewed in 2017 and followed up online in July during the coronavirus pandemic. Responding to questions about whether West Yorkshire could move into tier three, a statement just issued by Leeds City Council says: âWe are awaiting further talks with government regarding restrictions that are in place to tackle coronavirus in Leeds. ""At this current time we are not expecting tier status to change in Leeds this week.â Earlier today the government said discussions with West Yorkshire (Bradford, Leeds, Kirklees, Calderdale, Wakefield) about moving to the very high alert level were ongoing. Rishi Sunak has given an interview to explain the new measures he is taking to adapt his Winter Economic Plan, reflecting new regional restrictions in England. ""I've always said that we would need to adapt our
financial support as the situation evolves,"" he said. ""That's why today we're
announcing three measures that will ensure that we can protect more jobs and
support more businesses through the difficult winter months ahead."" Mr Sunak added he has always said he would ""adapt and evolve our support as the health situation
changes and that's clearly what's happened over the past few weeks"". Employers, he said, ""believe in the principle that this is a shared
endeavour that they want to support their employees alongside the government
and taxpayer, and they think it's right that employees are doing some work"". He ends with a message to people in England: ""Whether you're in a tier two
area [or a] tier three area, we've got support in place for you on a national basis"". A timely reminder as to the reason why you are seeing the prime minister and the chanellor together addressing BBC One viewers in the afternoon. The latest daily update shows the UK recorded another 21,242 coronavirus cases according to thegovernment's dashboard,external, while a further 189 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. The Spanish Canary Islands, the Maldives, Denmark and the Greek island of Mykonos have been added to the UK's list of travel corridors, the transport secretary has announced. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said people returning from these destinations from 04.00 BST on Sunday will no longer need to self-isolate for two weeks. However, Liechtenstein has become the only country to lose its exemption this week, meaning people returning from the country will need to quarantine on their return. Allow Twitter content?

Lastly, Jane Kirby of the Press Association asked Sir Patrick Vallance if a decent level of roll-out of a potential vaccine is achieved by next spring, how soon people might be able to stop social distancing and wearing face coverings. She asked the PM if he would reconsider his opposition to a national circuit break - a short, sharp lockdown - if those in Northern Ireland and Wales are shown to be more effective than tier three restrictions in England. Sir Patrick replies first, insisting he will not speculate on how effective the vaccines are going to be, but says once we know how effective they are, it could be determined ""how to use them best"". ""Clearly the aim of vaccination is to try to take most of the load of the infection spread onto the vaccine in order to be able to relieve other measures and that's got to be an aim we would all wish for,"" he adds. The PM said a national circuit break would be ""very damaging"" economically, socially and mentally for the country. ""We do think the local measures are right, and I repeat my gratitude to local leadership across the country, people who are helping to get the R rate down across their neighbourhoods... and that's what we're going to continue with."" Chris Smyth from the Times asked if the level of financial help will be available until a vaccine is in widespread use. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Job Support Scheme will last for at least six months through to the spring with a review point halfway through. Boris Johnson said ""billions more is going in to support jobs and livelihoods"" but adds ""we are going to have to pay this money back"". He said the government's objective is to keep the economy going so ""the UK can bounce back"". Smyth also asked if the test and trace scheme can still keep up with rising cases. Boris Johnson replied that there are ""interesting testing technologies"" being developed but added ""for the moment we have to use the tools we've got"". On vaccines, Sir Patrick said ""things are progressing well"" but suggest ""the widespread use of vaccines isn't going to be until spring next year"". Richard Partington of the Guardian asks the PM and the chancellor why the government was prepared to ""go to the wall"" over Â£5m with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham during the tier three negotiations, when they were preparing to announce ""billions of pounds"" more support in today's expansion. Boris Johnson says the negotiations between regional leaders and the government was ""all about fairness"" and making sure ""everybody got the same package"". He said No 10 is looking to address the national picture now and change with the evolving virus situation. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks if today's financial measures are an acknowledgement that ""you were not supporting parts of the north of England properly during the summer"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak replies: ""We want people to have equal support wherever they are."" Rigby also asks Sir Patrick Vallance if he is disappointed that the test and trace scheme is reaching less than 60% of contacts. ""It is very clear there is room for improvement,"" says Sir Patrick. He adds that the ""effectiveness of test and trace is less when the case numbers are high"". Ben Kentish of LBC asks about the latest NHS test and trace figures which showed that just 15% of coronavirus test results were returned within 24 hours. Boris Johnson says he ""shares peoples' frustrations"" and acknowledged the need to improve the situation to get faster turnaround times. He defends the achievements of the scheme as ""colossal"", including the expansion of testing capacity, adding that the ""technology is improving the whole time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income."" She also asks Sir Patrick Vallance about whether people elsewhere in the UK could be facing a ""digital"" Christmas - which is what people in Scotland could be facingafter a warning from the clinical director there. Sir Patrick says some level of restrictions will need to be in place ""for a while"" to get case numbers down, but progress is already being seen in some areas of the country. ""A lot depends on what happens now over the next few weeks,"" he adds, insisting the situation must be closely monitored. Yvonne in Surrey asks what would happen to the supply chain in the event of a national or local lockdown. She wants to know what financial help would be available to cover the costs of wages to businesses which have not been specifically told to close but have had a drop in income, due to other businesses in their supply chain being told to close. The PM says No 10 is ""doing everything we can"" to support businesses through the crisis and outlines some of the support and relief measures in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak adds that businesses told to close will be able to get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month for the length of closure and the wages of staff will be paid at two thirds. He adds there are support measures in place for businesses not told to close, announced earlier today. Now onto questions. Liam from Bradford asks how the government will encourage innovative businesses. Boris Johnson replies that business rates are ""unprecedentedly low"". And he adds that the government is investing in skills. Rishi Sunak also points to  government schemes to invest in start-up funds. Sir Patrick Vallance now talks through the government slides. He says the number of infections and people being admitted into hospital are continuing to rise. He adds that the more patients there are with Covid, the more pressure on the healthcare system overall. He says the R rate is growing but is still half of the natural R rate of three - and that this reflects ""the huge effort people have made to adhere to the measures in place"" such as wearing masks and washing hands. ""But the epidemic is still growing,"" he adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister's opening contribution to the news conference was a familiar one. The messy reality of a regional approach in England - with rules different here from they are there - represents a pragmatic approach to the pandemic, he claims. Why? The two alternatives, Boris Johnson argues, would be worse: lockdown, or letting the virus rip. It is a longstanding technique in political speech writing to paint your opponents as occupying relatively extreme positions either side of your own. But in this instance is also the crux of the government's argument: seemingly arbitrary rules, changing rapidly and varying geographically, might seem baffling, but they're better, or less worse, than doing anything else.

"Demand in pubs and restaurants has collapsed after bans on households mixing were introduced in many areas The chancellor has unveiled increased support for jobs and workers hit by Covid restrictions after growing clamour from firms in tier two areas. Rishi Sunak announced big changes to the Job Support Scheme (JSS) - set to replace furlough in November. He told the Commons that even businesses not forced to shut were facing ""profound economic uncertainty"". Under the revised scheme, employers will pay less and staff can work fewer hours before they qualify. At the same time, the taxpayer subsidy has been doubled. At an afternoon news conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked the chancellor for introducing measures that ""will protect people's livelihoods"". But he warned that the UK would face ""many thousands more deaths"" if it put the economy before health. Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, had complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions. They argued that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. One prominent chef, Yotam Ottolenghi, had said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"" since tier two restrictions were applied to London, adding: ""We are on our knees now."" In response to such arguments, Mr Sunak has now changed the terms of the JSS. Referring to those businesses, he said: ""It is clear that they require further economic support."" This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules Instead of a minimum requirement of paying 55% of wages for a third of hours, as announced last month at the launch of the Winter Economic Plan, employers will have to pay for a minimum of 20% of usual hours worked, and 5% of hours not worked. The government will now fund 62% of the wages for hours not worked. This more than doubles the maximum payment to Â£1,541.75 a month. In the most generous case, the taxpayer will now go from funding 22% of wages to just under half. Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What will I be paid if work has to close? What Covid tier is my area in? The scheme will, as before, be open to all small businesses and larger businesses that can show an impact on revenues. It is aimed at addressing the gap in support for businesses in tier two restrictions, such as London and Birmingham, but is not explicitly tied to that status, and is available across the UK. Noel Hutchinson, director of Poole-based powerboat experience firm Get Lost Sailing, is one small businessman who is feeling overlooked by the new measures. His firm is in a tier one area and so is not receiving any support, but he is seeing far fewer customers as a result of the virus. ""Whether or not businesses are in tier one, two or three, they are all being massively affected by the virus,"" he says. ""A hospitality and tourism business such as ours depends on out-of-town visitors and these people are no longer travelling. Our bookings have slowed massively."" Mr Hutchinson feels that a national lockdown would serve him better, since any government support would then be distributed across the country. ""It would be better for our industry if the whole country was locked down at once and every business in receipt of a fair proportion of the support packages."" The scheme is UK-wide. However, the system of tiered restrictions in England, which gave rise to the government's newly increased economic support, is not. While England has a three-tier system, Scotland is due to bring in a five-tier system of virus alert levels from 2 November. The middle three will be ""broadly equivalent"" to the English three, but the Scottish system will add an extra tier at the bottom and one at the top. Wales is about to enter a two-week national lockdown from 18:00 BST on Friday, while Northern Ireland began a four-week lockdown last Friday. All the devolved nations have been promised extra central government funding so they can award grants at a local level. Almost as soon as the heads of the CBI and the TUC appeared on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street to endorse last month's Winter Economic Plan, there were some doubts about its effectiveness. Business and union leaders were happy that some support for part-time working had been announced - itself a revolution for the UK - but the levels of support fell well short of German-style schemes. In particular, employers faced a hurdle of having to pay at least half of workers' wages. This was not a bug in the system - it was the strategy. The Treasury wanted the scheme to lean into a process of economic restructuring to a post-Covid ""new normal"" and not seek to prevent those changes. But all that was predicated on the pandemic being on the wane and the recovery assured. That has not proven to be the case, and indeed some had spotted that, even at the time of the original plan. This is an acknowledgement of gaps in that scheme and that large swathes of the economy are in survival, not restructure mode. For the chancellor, this is a sign that he will offer the right support at the right time. Others will say that the data was going in this direction a month ago, and that some jobs have unnecessarily been lost. Hospitality businesses gathered at a south London pizza restaurant also told the chancellor of their need for help with rents from landlords - something the Treasury thinks is far more tricky than, for example, mortgage holidays. In Greater Manchester, they will wonder why this wasn't offered to areas that were under strong social restrictions earlier. But this is a significant package worth several billion pounds, recognising the economy clearly needs support now before some inevitable fundamental changes. ""I've always said that we must be ready to adapt our financial support as the situation evolves, and that is what we are doing today. These changes mean that our support will reach many more people and protect many more jobs,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I know that the introduction of further restrictions has left many people worried for themselves, their families and communities. I hope the government's stepped-up support can be part of the country pulling together in the coming months."" Responding to his statement, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds criticised the government for what she said was a ""patchwork of poor ideas, rushed out at the last minute"". She said its approach to support for areas entering tier three had been ""nothing short of shambolic"". In other political reaction, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tweeted that the new measures had not been ""put on the table"" during negotiations with the government this week that failed to agree a Â£65m package of support. ""Honestly, can barely believe what I'm reading here,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The chancellor also announced specific help for hospitality and leisure businesses in tier two areas. English councils will be funded to give monthly grants of up to Â£2,100 to 150,000 hotels, restaurants and B&Bs. Devolved nations will be given the equivalent funding for other nations, under the Barnett Formula. The generosity of the self-employment scheme has also been doubled from 20% to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant now of Â£3,750 over a three-month period. What help are the self-employed getting from government? Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Business leaders welcomed the changes, with the CBI employers' group calling it a ""big step towards a more standardised approach"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls described it as ""a hugely generous package of support and very welcome news just when we needed it"". She said the changes to the scheme would ""help to safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs"" and give firms ""a much-enhanced chance of being able to overcome the challenges and survive into 2021"". Adam Marshall from the British Chambers of Commerce said it was a ""significant improvement"" for many struggling businesses. But he added: ""The true test of these reforms will be whether they help businesses on the ground get through the difficult months ahead."" Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, which works to improve the standard of living of low-paid workers, said Mr Sunak had done the right thing by expanding help for companies. ""Doing it earlier, given the obvious flaws, would have saved more jobs, but at least we've got to the right place 10 days ahead of the Job Support Scheme coming into effect,"" he said.

"A man purporting to be Banksy asked an assumed onlooker to move away Banksy's spray painting of a Tube carriage showed London Underground was ""not safe"", the RMT union has said. A video posted on the artist's Instagram in July showed a man, thought to be Banksy, disguised as a cleaner. He was wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and used equipment Tube staff would use to disinfect trains. Transport for London said the Tube was safe but the RMT, which many Tube staff belong to, said it was not a lapse in security but showed ""there wasn't any"". The work by Banksy, called If You Don't Mask, You Don't Get,featured a number of rats in pandemic-inspired poses and wearing face masks. It wasremoved by TfL cleaning crewswho were said to be unaware it was a Banksy artwork and treated it ""like any other graffiti on the network"". The transport authority has now confirmed to the BBC, in response a Freedom of Information Act request, that it had completed an investigation into the incident but would not release its findings because of security concerns and not wanting to encourage copycats. TfL said the artist carried out the graffiti between Barbican and Paddington on the Hammersmith and City Line between 05:24 and 06:31 on 10 July. It also confirmed it had no involvement with either the artist, his staff or lawyers. This video can not be played Coronavirus inspired Banksy artwork appears on Tube The footage also showed the artist painted the words ""I get lockdown"" on a wall right at the end of a station platform. TfL would not say which station it was but confirmed the artist did not go on the tracks. A spokesperson for the RMT said some stations had no gate-line staff at certain times of the day so people could ""literally walk on there with anything they like"". ""You can have a coffin under your arm let alone a canister full of paint,"" he said. He said the union had been campaigning over staffing levels because the stations were unstaffed for ""long periods of time and the end result is anything could happen"". ""What happened with a canister full of paint is actually very minor, considering what could have happened."" Safety has been a point of contention between the unions and TfL over the past few years, when theservice underwent job cuts as ticket offices were closed. On its website,external, TfL says it funds 2,500 police officers to work across London's transport network to keep people safe. The BBC has approached TfL for a statement. 'Missing' Banksy gorilla appears at auction Banksy claims hula-hooping girl artwork Ministers agree two-week TfL bailout extension Security consultant Will Geddes said it was difficult for Tube staff to check everyone to make sure they were who they appeared to be - for example, a cleaner. He said a balance had to be struck as TfL did not want to hold people up by having airport-style security. ""It's a bit of a human rights issue,"" he said. ""If you were to go to the Tube station, you would be very affronted if someone was asking you questions about why you were wearing that particular jacket today, or that hat or whatever it might be."" Mr Geddes said the wearing of face masks on the Tube was a security risk as it meant criminals were harder to spot. Brian Woodhead, Director of Customer Service for London Underground, said: ""The safety of our customers and staff is always our primary concern, and ensuring the security of our network is a key part of that. ""We work closely with our station staff, our trade unions and with partners including the British Transport Police to ensure that the network is as secure as possible.""

"Ticketing site Viagogo may need to sell all or part of StubHub after an investigation by the UK's competition watchdog found the merger of the two firms could lead to higher fees. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal would reduce competition as the two firms have a combined market share of more than 90%. Viagogo bought StubHub in February for $4.1bn (Â£3.1bn). Viagogo said it would work with the CMA to find a solution. The CMA's findings are from its provisional report. Its final report is due in December. ""The evidence we've seen so far consistently points in the same direction - that Viagogo and StubHub have a market share of more than 90% combined and compete closely with each other,"" said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the CMA inquiry group. ""We are therefore concerned that their merger could lead to secondary ticketing customers facing higher fees and lower quality services. The CMA said its concerns would be addressed by a full sale of StubHub, while a partial sale would have to include ""at least the assets and operations of either StubHub or Viagogo that cover the relevant market - the supply of uncapped secondary ticketing platform services for the resale of tickets to UK events"". The watchdog added:  ""The CMA is mindful of the significant impact that the coronavirus (Covid-19) is currently having on the live events industry. ""However, the evidence is that Viagogo and StubHub would remain important competitors for the foreseeable future without the merger."" A spokesperson for Viagogo said: ""Whilst we disagree with the provisional conclusion that the deal would reduce competition, we look forward to working with the CMA to deliver a comprehensive solution which addresses their concerns."" This is not the first time Viagogo has come under the eye of the competition watchdog. Last year, Viagogo dodged CMA legal action after improvingwhat it tells customers about tickets, including seating information and whether the venue had banned ticket resales. The CMA welcomed the changes but criticised the site's slowness to respond. This summer, Viagogo wascriticised for refusing to give refundsto people who had bought tickets on its site to events hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Consumer organisation Which? said the ticketing site had added a clause to its cancellation policy which had left some customers unable to claim their money back. But Viagogo said the claim was ""fundamentally inaccurate"" since their policy on refunding customers had not changed.

"A scientist advising the government on ethnicity and Covid says ""structural racism is not a reasonable explanation"" for black and south Asian people's greater risk of illness and death. An earlier report by Public Health England saidracismmay contribute to the unequal death toll. Dr Raghib Ali suggested it was time to stop using ethnicity when deciding who needed help. He said focusing on factors like jobs and housing would help more people. The newly appointed expert adviser said this approach would help prevent everyone at risk - including poorer white groups living in crowded housing - from missing out on help. But Dr Chris Udenze, a GP who has also worked in public health, said it was important not to dismiss ethnicity. He told the BBC: ""I think the whole thing is very complicated. Ethnicity is not the only factor but it is definitely one of many factors. ""All the other factors such socioeconomic factors, diabetes etc are important but even if you were able to take these away, there is still a disparity. Ethnicity is still a relevant factor and not paying attention to this will not help communities vulnerable to Covid."" He added: ""Similarly, structural racism may not be a reasonable explanation by itself but it is one of many factors that contributes to disparity and this has been backed up by many reports. Dr Ali made his comments during a briefing on the first quarterly report on Covid disparities, led by the government's Race Disparity Unit and the Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch. The document is a stocktake of the actions taken and evidence gathered since previous analyses by Public Health England, which set out the greater risks faced by black, Asian and other ethnic minority groups. One previous report by Public Health England, published in June, said: ""Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work may mean that individuals in BAME groups are less likely to seek care when needed or as NHS staff are less likely to speak up when they have concerns about personal protective equipment or risk."" This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? To find out more about why the increased risks exist for certain ethnic groups, the authors reviewed recent studies, including figures from the Office for National Statistics, and Public Health England. While no single study was able to examine all the possible reasons, the report agrees with previous analyses that a range of factors are involved. These include: Where people live - with a higher risk in urban areas with greater population density Occupational exposure - for example data shows Black people are more likely to work in healthcare than other groups Household composition, with larger households at greater risk Pre-existing health conditions - such as obesity, which can make it harder to recover from the virus Dr Ali said that while studies often differed in their conclusions, the older people are, and where they lived, were two of the biggest factors behind the increased risks. He added that much of the increased risk faced by ethnic minorities could be explained by factors such as the ones mentioned above. But he agreed with the report authors that a ""small part"" of the excess risk remained unexplained for some groups. Some data shows even when multiple risk factors are put together and taken into account, black and other ethnic minorities are still at an increased risk of death Perhaps the most noteworthy conclusion of this report by the government's Race Disparity Unit is that ""a part of the excess risk remains unexplained"". Nine months into the Covid-19 pandemic it is still not totally clear why BAME communities are more vulnerable to the virus and more likely than others to become seriously ill or die. The report runs through familiar themes, such as occupations with higher risk of exposure to the virus, underlying health conditions, concentration in densely-populated urban areas and multi-generational households. But it does not uncover any new explanations. The expert adviser Dr Raghib Ali rules out ""structural racism"" though others will disagree, arguing that historic experiences of discrimination may deter people from seeking healthcare or adequate protection at work. Ministers acknowledge that there is more work to be done but important steps have been taken to improve monitoring and gather further evidence. However, with a second wave of coronavirus now evident and winter approaching, there will be continuing apprehension among some in ethnic minority groups. It will become mandatory for ethnicity to be recorded on death certificates as ""this is the only way of establishing a complete picture of the impact of the virus on ethnic minorities"". This will involve patients being asked about ethnicity during consultations with their doctors. A community champions scheme will help increase tailored communication and advice for communities most at-risk and fund grassroots groups. Recommendations in the report include: Risk assessments at work for everyone, not just people from ethnic minority groups, to avoid stigma and help protect all people in need of support A risk calculator tool is being developed by the University of Oxford to help doctors and individuals understand more about their risks from Covid. Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch, told the BBC: ""Quite often people expect there will be announcement that will be specifically just for ethnic minorities but actually the risk profile for vulnerability goes across many different groups. She added: ""We have made sure all of the work we have done, all of the action taken to safeguard people's lives have been done across the population as a whole, with a particular focus on the vulnerable."" Dr Raghib Ali In the briefing, Dr Ali said: ""The problem with focusing on ethnicity as a risk factor is that it misses the very large number of non-ethnic minority groups, so whites basically, who also live in deprived areas and overcrowded housing and with high risk occupations."" He added the whole population should have a ""personalised risk assessment"" rather than just targeting ethnic groups. ""It doesn't make sense to put all ethnic minorities in the same basket as it doesn't make sense to put all whites in the same basket,"" he said. On structural racism, he said he was not convinced by the narrative that racism played a part in coronavirus deaths. He pointed out that generally people from BAME backgrounds have better health outcomes than other groups. Meanwhile the Institute for Public Policy Research, said: """"As the government's report rightly says, disparities in Covid-19 are driven by structural differences between ethnic groups in terms of deprivation, living conditions and low-wage public facing jobs. We agree. Let's call this what it is - structural racism. ""The academic literature is clear - race and ethnicity are determinants of health. It is outlandish it suggest otherwise."" The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, said there needed to be tangible action right now to protect Black, Asian and ethnic minority people. ""As we sit amid a second wave of infections, we know that about a third of those admitted to intensive care are not white - showing no change since the first peak,"" said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair. ""Meanwhile, black and Asian people have been found twice as likely to be infected compared to white people."" GP, Dr Hajira Dambha-Miller, said she welcomed the comprehensive report. But she added: ""Further detail is still needed in explaining why BAME groups are more susceptible to worse outcomes. I don't think the report goes far enough in exploring the wider social factors that may contribute to viral transmission and death.""

"Michel Barnier resumed talks on Friday after arriving in the UK on Thursday evening. Talks over a post-Brexit trade deal have resumed in London, after negotiators returned to the table following a week-long standoff. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss insisted a deal can still be done with the EU, as officials began a new round of ""intensified"" daily talks. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that ""every day counts"" ahead of a looming December deadline. He said both sides share a ""huge common responsibility"" as talks restarted. Negotiations stalled last week after a summit in Brussels where EU leaderscalled on the UKto ""make the necessary moves"" towards a deal. But the UK side agreed to resume talks after Mr Barnier said ""compromises on both sides"" were needed, in a speech on Wednesday. UK 'ready to welcome EU' to continue trade talks Trade talks are back on - but what's changed? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. Key areas of disagreement include fishing rights, post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. Speaking after the UKformally signedits post-Brexit trade deal with Japan, Ms Truss said the UK also wanted to strike a ""good deal with the EU"". ""We're in intense negotiations with the EU. We've made real progress,"" she told reporters on Friday. In an interview with the BBC, she added any agreement would have to be based ""on the principle that the UK is a sovereign nation"". At a signing ceremony in Tokyo, Japan's foreign minister also called on the EU and UK to reach a deal, which he said was important to Japanese firms. Arriving in the UK on Thursday, ahead of a meeting with UK counterpart Lord David Frost, Mr Barnier told reporters it was ""important to be back at the table"". The pair will meet again on Friday, during an ""initial"" renewed negotiation round running until Sunday, with subsequent talks planned in both Brussels and London. These later talks could either take place in person or be held via video link if Covid restrictions apply, if both sides agree. In line with a demand made by the UK, both sides will resume talks on all subjects based on proposed legal texts prepared by officials. Theyhave also agreed,externalthat ""nothing is agreed"" until progress has been reached in all areas - which has been a key demand of the EU. You could be forgiven for thinking that what we've witnessed over the past few days is a bit of political theatre. Cover for the government - post chest-beating- to return to the negotiating table where they know the time has now come for tough compromises to be made. EU leaders also went out of their way to sound tough on Brexit at their summit last week. Privately, a number of EU figures now admit it was a misstep. But EU leaders play to the domestic gallery too. They wanted to show they were ""standing up to the UK"" - that leaving the EU doesn't pay and that EU interests would be defended. Read more from Katya here The two sides have been at odds over the issue of so-called ""state aid"" rules, which limit government help for industry in the name of ensuring fair economic competition. The UK has rejected an EU demand made earlier in the year for it to continue following the bloc's rules on such subsidies as part of a trade agreement. Lord Frost has suggested the UK could instead agree ""principles"" for how subsidies are spent - something welcomed by Mr Barnier on Wednesday. The two sides are also haggling over how much European fishing boats should be able to catch in British waters from next year. The EU has so far resisted UK demands for annual talks to decide stock limits, as well as a reduction in access for its vessels to British fishing grounds. By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization. YOUR WORK, YOUR MONEY:Is my bar business better off in Tier 3?

"Losing access to EU databases could make identifying people with a criminal history harder Many more EU citizens with criminal records will be barred from entering the UK from January, the Home Office has said. People sentenced to more than a year in prison will be turned away, in line with other foreign nationals. Previously, officials had to show EU offenders presented a serious threat. But there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make it harder to identify foreign criminals, BBC home editor Mark Easton said. With the UK in a transition period since it formally left the EU in January, an EU citizen can currently only be refused entry if they present a genuine, present and serious threat. Patel sets out post-Brexit immigration plans Will there be security co-operation after Brexit? How will the UK points-based immigration system work? Regulations being laid in Parliament on Thursday set out the new rules for when the transition period ends, which treat EU and non-EU citizens the same. The new rules mean from 1 January: Any EU citizen sentenced to at least a year in prison will be barred EU citizens who have committed any criminal offence in the past year could also be barred EU citizens could also be banned if they were sentenced to less than a year in jail, with officials reviewing their full criminal history and links to the UK Offenders who have not served a prison sentence could still be barred if there is evidence they are ""persistent"" criminals, they cause ""serious harm"" or their presence in the UK is not ""conducive to the public good"" People involved in a sham marriage could be banned from entry, and anyone breaching customs regulations could also be turned away. The changes also mean EU citizens found rough sleeping could be deported if they refuse support from authorities, such as the offer of accommodation, as is already the case for non-EU citizens. Officials said this could apply to people living on the streets who commit crimes or act in anti-social ways, such as aggressively begging. But they said it would be a last resort and checks would be carried out to ensure the rough sleepers were not victims of modern slavery or trafficking. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The regulations could mean tens of thousands of people from Europe can no longer enter the UK. But with no long-term agreement on trade and other areas of co-operation with the EU when the transition agreement expires, the UK faces losing access to the European Criminal Records Information System and the EU's passenger database. That could make it harder to identify arrivals with a criminal history. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the rules would be ""firmer and fairer"", applying the same rules on criminality to people from all countries. EU citizens living in Britain who have immigration status under the EU Settlement Scheme, or any others who are protected by the Withdrawal Agreement, are exempt from these rules. However, the Home Office said that their status could be revoked if they commit a crime after 1 January if it results in a prison sentence of more than a year.

"The idea of a normal Christmas is a ""fiction"" and Scots should prepare for digital celebrations, national clinical director Jason Leitch has said. The government has insisted that the latest Covid-19 restrictions are having an impact on the spread of the virus. But Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland there was ""absolutely no question"" of a ""normal"" Christmas being allowed. Measures could be eased if case numbers fall, but Mr Leitch said people should ""get their digital Christmas ready"". Opposition politicians said the public would be ""devastated"" by the news and called for more details. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government was making ""really tough"" decisions and would not ""tell people what they want to hear to make it easier in the here and now"". Licensed trade warns of 'battle' to survive Covid-19 in Scotland: Five numbers to watch What are the Covid rules where I live? Tight restrictions on the hospitality trade focused in particular on Scotland's central belt have been extended for another week as coronavirus case numbers continue to rise. These short-term measures are to be replaced with a new five-tier system of alert levels from 2 November, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that this does not rule out ""even tougher restrictions"" being imposed if necessary. Speaking on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch said the current curbs - along with the ongoing ban on household gatherings - was causing a ""deceleration"" in the increase of cases. He initially said it was ""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas, but sounded a note of caution over the prospect of measures being eased significantly over the winter. He said: ""I'm hopeful costs now may get us a more family Christmas. But Christmas is not going to be normal, there's absolutely no question about that. ""We are not going to be in large family groupings, with multiple families coming round - that is fiction for this year. ""I'm hopeful that if we can get numbers down to a certain level we may be able to get some form of normality. But people should get their digital Christmas ready."" Nicola Sturgeon said she may make Prof Leitch dress up as The Grinch following his comments Ms Sturgeon has previously insisted it was too early to plan for Christmas, saying it was too soon to tell what impact restrictions are having on the spread of the virus. The government will publish guidance this weekend about how families should celebrate Halloween, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""It is not safe right now to do these things as normal."" The first minister said that the more people stuck with the rules ""the more chance there is"" of a more normal festive period, but said government had to be ""honest and straightforward"" with people. She added: ""Some of the really tough additional things governments are doing right now with extra restrictions are also in part about trying to deal decisively with an upsurge in the virus now, so we give ourselves the best chance of greater normality at Christmas. ""Christmas this year for no country anywhere is going to be absolutely normal and without any restrictions. I could do what politicians would do in normal times and try to tell you otherwise, and let people down nearer the time, but that's not the right approach right now. ""We are not likely to be able to celebrate Christmas with no limits on how many people we have in our homes and on what we do."" She said that the ""best chance of getting as much normality over the Christmas period as possible is for all of us to abide by these restrictions and all the guidance right now"". Ms Sturgeon added that any restrictions would not prevent Santa from delivering presents to children on Christmas Eve, describing him as a ""key worker"". Following Prof Leitch's comments, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the government must allow an open public debate if it ""expects months more of sacrifices"". He said: ""People have made huge sacrifices for months on end, they will be devastated to hear that Christmas as they know it is cancelled this year. ""Many will rightly question whether the government have used the past six months as well as they could have to expand testing, shore up our NHS and prepare for a second wave."" Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Brian Whittle said ""clear and concise communication"" was important in controlling the virus. He said: ""We have to be realistic and accept that this Christmas very probably won't be normal, but that's a different thing from suggesting that families might only be able to get together online.

"Specialist hospital Whorlton Hall, in County Durham, was closed after the BBC's Panorama exposed a culture of abuse there Too many hospitals for people with learning disabilities or autism are providing poor care which is, at times, undignified and inhumane, the care regulator for England has said. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found physical restraint part of the culture in some places, and cases of patients secluded or segregated for 13 years. The review was prompted by a BBC News investigation. Care Minister Helen Whately said the findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""Nobody should be receiving such poor care,"" she said. ""We are already taking action, including investment in community services, independent case reviews of people in long term segregation, and the ongoing work overseen by Baroness Hollins. ""I am determined that this level of care should no longer have any place in our health system, and will carefully consider the recommendations in this report."" The CQC said national change was needed to stop people ""falling through the gaps"". The NHS said it was reducing the number of people in specialist hospitals. A spokesman added that, since 2015, the number admitted had been cut by nearly a third and the NHS was committed to reducing that further while it invests more in community support and improves the quality of inpatient care. The CQC's review was prompted by aBBC File on 4 programme in 2018 which highlighted use of restraints on disabled patients. Following that report the regulator was commissioned by Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to look at the use of restraint, seclusion and segregation of autistic people. A Panorama programme in 2019 also exposedthe mistreatment of residents at Whorlton Hall Hospital. The specialist hospital in County Durham was closed after undercover filming showed staff intimidating, mocking and restraining patients with learning disabilities or autism. Patients with learning disabilities at Whorlton Hall were mocked and intimidated CQC inspectors visited 43 hospital wards for people with a learning disability or autism, and specialist child and adolescent mental health wards, and other facilities. 'Devious staff' misled abuse hospital inspectors How we uncovered abuse at specialist hospital Arrests after hospital abuse film They found most of the mental health wards were not therapeutic environments and could be ""noisy, chaotic and unpredictable"". People were seen ""as a condition or a collection of negative behaviours"", the report found, with the result often being restraint, seclusion or segregation. The report highlighted the case of Bethany, a girl with autism and extreme anxiety who was kept in seclusion for almost two years. She was held in what her father Jeremy hasdescribed as a ""cell""at St Andrew's Healthcare in Northampton, as revealed byBBC File on 4. Jeremy told the CQC report that her regular staff had no training or understanding of her diagnosis and her behaviour got more challenging, leading to self-harm. ""This anger and self-harm was met by regular restraint, she was held down by multiple people for up to four hours,"" he said. Occasionally handcuffs and leg straps were used to contain her as well as ""suffocating spit hoods"". Bethany waseventually awarded damages for her treatmentafter St Andrew's Healthcare, NHS England Walsall Council and Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group accepted her care did not always comply with the mental health practices and ""there were unfortunate delays in moving Bethany from what became an unsuitable placement for her"". Her father told the report she was now in a setting which had been created with her input with fully-trained staff. He said: ""The unnecessary medicinal straitjacket has been weaned off and replaced with compassion, understanding and a desire to move Beth to a productive, fulfilling life."" Patients were ""often"" subject to restrictive practices because they did not receive care early on, it found. The regulator also said it was concerned that some people were being prosecuted for injuring staff, when a failure to treat their needs may have contributed to their aggression. The review also found: Most (81%) of 313 wards for children and young people had used physical restraint in the previous month The length of time people spent in long-term segregation ranged from three days to 13 years A lack of suitable care in the community was preventing the discharge of 60% of people it saw during its review Some people in seclusion were not allowed to wear their own clothes, while others lacked a clean environment and crockery, cutlery and toilet paper In one case, ward staff stopped the mother of a 24-year-old in long-term segregation from visiting for five months, prevented the patient from using the toilet on occasion, and left her in pain for months with an injured arm. Part of the tragedy that lies behind today's report is that the failings of long-term hospital care for people with learning disabilities and autism are well documented - in abuse scandals, in report after report calling for change and in missed government deadlines for their closure. But the problems start long before people reach hospital. I've spoken to family after family who say if there had been enough specialist help when their child's behaviour first became challenging, usually during puberty, then they might not have reached a crisis. They struggled to get the community support needed to keep their child out of hospital, but local help centred on the individual is likely to cost less than the huge sums paid for inpatient care. This report underlines the predictability of many of the problems and sets out clear solutions. The question now is will it lead to change this time. The CQC found the ward environment, a lack of specialised training and support for staff meant patients' care did not always meet their needs, with people in community-based services experiencing a better quality of life. The reportOut Of Sight - Who Cares?,externalhas called for better capacity in the community and across education and health and care to provide earlier care and prevent people being admitted to hospital. Dr Kevin Cleary, the CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals and lead for mental health, said seclusion and restraint should only be used in extreme cases. ""We saw too many examples where people were subject to unnecessary restrictions and examples of people's human rights at risk of being breached."" He added people often ended up in hospital because they ""did not have the right support early on"" and said that once in hospital people often did not receive specialist treatment and had no support to leave. ""There is no excuse for this,"" he said. Edel Harris, chief executive of the learning disability charity Mencap, said the findings were ""shocking but sadly not surprising"", adding ""people deserve to live in homes, not hospitals"". A NHS spokesman said the NHS has funded a restrictive practice programme led by the Royal College of Psychiatrists that had ""already resulted in the reduction of physical restraint and seclusion"" and said it would be backed by ""intensive support for the 20 young people's inpatient services where the use of restraint is most prevalent"".

Her father told the report she was now in a setting which had been created with her input with fully-trained staff. He said: ""The unnecessary medicinal straitjacket has been weaned off and replaced with compassion, understanding and a desire to move Beth to a productive, fulfilling life."" Patients were ""often"" subject to restrictive practices because they did not receive care early on, it found. The regulator also said it was concerned that some people were being prosecuted for injuring staff, when a failure to treat their needs may have contributed to their aggression. The review also found: Most (81%) of 313 wards for children and young people had used physical restraint in the previous month The length of time people spent in long-term segregation ranged from three days to 13 years A lack of suitable care in the community was preventing the discharge of 60% of people it saw during its review Some people in seclusion were not allowed to wear their own clothes, while others lacked a clean environment and crockery, cutlery and toilet paper In one case, ward staff stopped the mother of a 24-year-old in long-term segregation from visiting for five months, prevented the patient from using the toilet on occasion, and left her in pain for months with an injured arm. Part of the tragedy that lies behind today's report is that the failings of long-term hospital care for people with learning disabilities and autism are well documented - in abuse scandals, in report after report calling for change and in missed government deadlines for their closure. But the problems start long before people reach hospital. I've spoken to family after family who say if there had been enough specialist help when their child's behaviour first became challenging, usually during puberty, then they might not have reached a crisis. They struggled to get the community support needed to keep their child out of hospital, but local help centred on the individual is likely to cost less than the huge sums paid for inpatient care. This report underlines the predictability of many of the problems and sets out clear solutions. The question now is will it lead to change this time. The CQC found the ward environment, a lack of specialised training and support for staff meant patients' care did not always meet their needs, with people in community-based services experiencing a better quality of life. The reportOut Of Sight - Who Cares?,externalhas called for better capacity in the community and across education and health and care to provide earlier care and prevent people being admitted to hospital. Dr Kevin Cleary, the CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals and lead for mental health, said seclusion and restraint should only be used in extreme cases. ""We saw too many examples where people were subject to unnecessary restrictions and examples of people's human rights at risk of being breached."" He added people often ended up in hospital because they ""did not have the right support early on"" and said that once in hospital people often did not receive specialist treatment and had no support to leave. ""There is no excuse for this,"" he said. Edel Harris, chief executive of the learning disability charity Mencap, said the findings were ""shocking but sadly not surprising"", adding ""people deserve to live in homes, not hospitals"". A NHS spokesman said the NHS has funded a restrictive practice programme led by the Royal College of Psychiatrists that had ""already resulted in the reduction of physical restraint and seclusion"" and said it would be backed by ""intensive support for the 20 young people's inpatient services where the use of restraint is most prevalent"".

"KeolisAmey has run Transport for Wales rail services since October 2018 The Transport for Wales rail service is to be brought under Welsh Government control from next February. Ministers have confirmed the takeover from KeolisAmey, with day-to-day services to be run by a publicly-owned company. It follows significant falls in passenger numbers during the pandemic. The Welsh Tories questioned how much nationalisation will cost taxpayers, while Plaid Cymru called for the Senedd to be recalled. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the government had stepped in ""to stabilise the network and keep it running"". ""The last few months have been extremely challenging for public transport in Wales and across the UK. Covid has significantly impacted passenger revenues,"" he said. TfW rail customers 'among least satisfied in UK' Rail boss urges patience after first year KeolisAmey was awarded the franchise in 2018, taking over from Arriva Trains Wales. It covers most of Wales' trains - including key commuter services such as the Valley Lines. Transport for Wales will run Wales and Borders services from February The financial risk of the Wales and Borders rail franchise, which is branded Transport for Wales (TfW), had already been taken over by taxpayers under aÂ£65m agreement,externalsigned in May. But from February next year KeolisAmey staff working on rail services will be transferred over to a publicly owned company, currently called Transport for Wales Rail Ltd. It is happening under a part of railway law that allows for the creation of operators of ""last resort"". Officials say the time gap between now and the start of the new operator will allow the Welsh Government to prepare the new operator for service. A part of the original agreement is staying - Amey Keolis Infrastructure Ltd will continue to be responsible for infrastructure on the Core Valley Lines, where the South Wales Metro upgrade is taking place. Keolis and Amey will also work with the Welsh Government quango Transport for Wales on improvements to the service - like rolling stock and ticketing. Kevin Thomas, chief executive of KeolisAmey Wales, said: ""In light of Covid-19, we recognise the need for Welsh Government to have a sustainable way forward for delivering its ambitious objectives for rail."" KeolisAmey took over from Arriva Trains Wales in 2018 Challenged on the decision later on Thursday, Mr Skates told a Senedd committee that if the existing arrangements had continued it would have ""led to a collapse by the operator and a catastrophic transfer then to the operator of last resort [Transport for Wales Rail Ltd]. ""What we're able to do now is manage a careful transition, which will take us through to February, and then beyond, with the establishment of TfW rail limited,"" he said. Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters said: ""The whole business model collapsed in the face of Covid because the revenue was not coming in and Keolis in effect were not prepared to shoulder their share of the pain."" Asked about the long-term costs of propping up the network, he said: ""It depends on Covid. We don't know."" Ministers pledged to honour commitments worth more than Â£1bn to buy new trains and build the south Wales Metro. ""That will be delivered,"" Mr Skates said. James Price, chief executive of Welsh Government quango Transport for Wales which oversaw the franchise and shared branding with it, said that rolling stock is ""on the way"" and ""in essence is paid for already"". ""What this allows us to do is to reduce the profit we pay to the private sector massively over time, and make sure that when the revenue comes back, it comes back in to the taxpayer."" Russell George, economy spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Given the track record of the Welsh Labour-led Government, its decision to take control of our vital train industry has not filled me with any hope."" He said ministers should have consulted the Senedd on ""how much this decision is going to cost the Welsh taxpayer"". ""Eyebrows will be raised, too, on why any support is being left until February 2021,"" Mr George added. Plaid Cymru transport spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said it ""could well be the right decision"", saying her party ""has always maintained that our railways should be brought into public hands and the government put passengers before profit"". But she said there were ""crucial questions"" on financial implications and the nature of the subsidiary. ""Decisions of this importance should be announced in the Senedd so that members can ask questions on behalf of the people of Wales,"" she said. KeolisAmey already runs the Docklands Light Railway in London KeolisAmey is a joint-venture between two European companies, andwas awarded the Wales and Borders franchise in May 2018in a Â£5bn contract. It was the first time the Welsh Government had awarded the franchise. Keolis is France's largest private sector public transport operator - but its major shareholder is state-owned French railway SNCF. Amey is a former one-time UK company owned by Spanish infrastructure giant Ferrovial. KeolisAmey took over services in October 2018. In January it emerged it had beenfined Â£3.4m over the performance of services. Rail unions backed the move. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""There is huge public support for public ownership because privatisation and profiteering has never been an efficient way to provide value for money, and this is even more the case when extra funding has been needed during the coronavirus pandemic."" Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA, said: ""This is a welcome and positive step from the Welsh Government, which will put our railways back in public hands and again shows the abject failure of privatisation."" We are told passengers will not notice the changeover. The same trains, staffed by the same drivers and conductors, will arrive at platforms. But there are new risks for the taxpayer. Ticket sales have plummeted. So in May the Welsh Government announced Â£65m and an emergency agreement to help the service cope. In practice, that means almost all the financial risks associated with the railway are borne by the government. Profits and losses have moved from the private sector into the public sector.

"Specialist hospital Whorlton Hall, in County Durham, was closed after the BBC's Panorama exposed a culture of abuse there Too many hospitals for people with learning disabilities or autism are providing poor care which is, at times, undignified and inhumane, the care regulator for England has said. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found physical restraint part of the culture in some places, and cases of patients secluded or segregated for 13 years. The review was prompted by a BBC News investigation. Care Minister Helen Whately said the findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""Nobody should be receiving such poor care,"" she said. ""We are already taking action, including investment in community services, independent case reviews of people in long term segregation, and the ongoing work overseen by Baroness Hollins. ""I am determined that this level of care should no longer have any place in our health system, and will carefully consider the recommendations in this report."" The CQC said national change was needed to stop people ""falling through the gaps"". The NHS said it was reducing the number of people in specialist hospitals. A spokesman added that, since 2015, the number admitted had been cut by nearly a third and the NHS was committed to reducing that further while it invests more in community support and improves the quality of inpatient care. The CQC's review was prompted by aBBC File on 4 programme in 2018 which highlighted use of restraints on disabled patients. Following that report the regulator was commissioned by Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock to look at the use of restraint, seclusion and segregation of autistic people. A Panorama programme in 2019 also exposedthe mistreatment of residents at Whorlton Hall Hospital. The specialist hospital in County Durham was closed after undercover filming showed staff intimidating, mocking and restraining patients with learning disabilities or autism. Patients with learning disabilities at Whorlton Hall were mocked and intimidated CQC inspectors visited 43 hospital wards for people with a learning disability or autism, and specialist child and adolescent mental health wards, and other facilities. 'Devious staff' misled abuse hospital inspectors How we uncovered abuse at specialist hospital Arrests after hospital abuse film They found most of the mental health wards were not therapeutic environments and could be ""noisy, chaotic and unpredictable"". People were seen ""as a condition or a collection of negative behaviours"", the report found, with the result often being restraint, seclusion or segregation. The report highlighted the case of Bethany, a girl with autism and extreme anxiety who was kept in seclusion for almost two years. She was held in what her father Jeremy hasdescribed as a ""cell""at St Andrew's Healthcare in Northampton, as revealed byBBC File on 4. Jeremy told the CQC report that her regular staff had no training or understanding of her diagnosis and her behaviour got more challenging, leading to self-harm. ""This anger and self-harm was met by regular restraint, she was held down by multiple people for up to four hours,"" he said. Occasionally handcuffs and leg straps were used to contain her as well as ""suffocating spit hoods"". Bethany waseventually awarded damages for her treatmentafter St Andrew's Healthcare, NHS England Walsall Council and Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group accepted her care did not always comply with the mental health practices and ""there were unfortunate delays in moving Bethany from what became an unsuitable placement for her"".

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the testing system in England must improve, but defends its capacity as ""colossal"" He holds a briefing alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance Further support for workers in parts of England under tier two restrictions are announced by the chancellor Under the new Job Support Scheme the government will fund up to half of the wages of people unable to work their full hours Firms in affected areas will also be eligible for cash grants of up to Â£2,100 a month Stoke, Coventry and Slough will be moved into tier 2 Covid restrictions Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie WilmÃ¨s - who was the country's prime minister until last month - admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 Greater Manchester will enter tier three restrictions just after midnight Edited by John Hand We are pausing our live coverage for today, thank you for joining us. We will resume our coverage tomorrow morning. As we bring our live coverage to a close, here's a final roundup of today's key developments in the UK: Take a look at our charts with the latest on coronavirus in the UK - including a map of the local authorities with extra restrictions in place and the most recent data on the number of positive cases.  Gavin BevisBBC News Nottingham's seven-day coronavirus infection rate has fallen again. The latest figure - reflecting cases for the week to 19 October - is 561.4 per 100,000 people, down from 604.5 yesterday. Nottingham now has the fifth highest rate in England, behind Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Rossendale and Liverpool. The city and county of Nottinghamshire are still waiting to hear whether they will be made subject to tier three restrictions in the coming days. A meeting between local leaders and a government minister was due to take place at 16:30. During his coronavirus briefing, televised live on BBC One this afternoon, Boris Johnson said he wanted to travel ""a middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus"". Scylla is a monster from Greek mythology who lived on a rock. While Charybdis refers to a nearby deadly whirlpool. Heroic figures such as Odysseus would have to pick a careful course between the two foes to avoid being eaten or drowned.

Two in five children aged 11 to 16 in England feel the coronavirus lockdown has made their lives worse,an NHS report on mental health suggests. They said their biggest anxieties were about missing school and family and friends contracting Covid-19. Mental disorders have risen across both genders since 2017. In boys, they rose from 11% to 16% and in girls from 10% to 15%, the report found. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, described the increase as ""extremely alarming"" and called for a properly-funded children's mental health service and for every school to have its own NHS-funded counsellor. The report is based on a survey of 3,570 children and young people up to the age of 22 who were interviewed in 2017 and followed up online in July during the coronavirus pandemic. Responding to questions about whether West Yorkshire could move into tier three, a statement just issued by Leeds City Council says: âWe are awaiting further talks with government regarding restrictions that are in place to tackle coronavirus in Leeds. ""At this current time we are not expecting tier status to change in Leeds this week.â Earlier today the government said discussions with West Yorkshire (Bradford, Leeds, Kirklees, Calderdale, Wakefield) about moving to the very high alert level were ongoing. Rishi Sunak has given an interview to explain the new measures he is taking to adapt his Winter Economic Plan, reflecting new regional restrictions in England. ""I've always said that we would need to adapt our
financial support as the situation evolves,"" he said. ""That's why today we're
announcing three measures that will ensure that we can protect more jobs and
support more businesses through the difficult winter months ahead."" Mr Sunak added he has always said he would ""adapt and evolve our support as the health situation
changes and that's clearly what's happened over the past few weeks"". Employers, he said, ""believe in the principle that this is a shared
endeavour that they want to support their employees alongside the government
and taxpayer, and they think it's right that employees are doing some work"". He ends with a message to people in England: ""Whether you're in a tier two
area [or a] tier three area, we've got support in place for you on a national basis"". A timely reminder as to the reason why you are seeing the prime minister and the chanellor together addressing BBC One viewers in the afternoon. The latest daily update shows the UK recorded another 21,242 coronavirus cases according to thegovernment's dashboard,external, while a further 189 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. The Spanish Canary Islands, the Maldives, Denmark and the Greek island of Mykonos have been added to the UK's list of travel corridors, the transport secretary has announced. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said people returning from these destinations from 04.00 BST on Sunday will no longer need to self-isolate for two weeks. However, Liechtenstein has become the only country to lose its exemption this week, meaning people returning from the country will need to quarantine on their return. Allow Twitter content?

Lastly, Jane Kirby of the Press Association asked Sir Patrick Vallance if a decent level of roll-out of a potential vaccine is achieved by next spring, how soon people might be able to stop social distancing and wearing face coverings. She asked the PM if he would reconsider his opposition to a national circuit break - a short, sharp lockdown - if those in Northern Ireland and Wales are shown to be more effective than tier three restrictions in England. Sir Patrick replies first, insisting he will not speculate on how effective the vaccines are going to be, but says once we know how effective they are, it could be determined ""how to use them best"". ""Clearly the aim of vaccination is to try to take most of the load of the infection spread onto the vaccine in order to be able to relieve other measures and that's got to be an aim we would all wish for,"" he adds. The PM said a national circuit break would be ""very damaging"" economically, socially and mentally for the country. ""We do think the local measures are right, and I repeat my gratitude to local leadership across the country, people who are helping to get the R rate down across their neighbourhoods... and that's what we're going to continue with."" Chris Smyth from the Times asked if the level of financial help will be available until a vaccine is in widespread use. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Job Support Scheme will last for at least six months through to the spring with a review point halfway through. Boris Johnson said ""billions more is going in to support jobs and livelihoods"" but adds ""we are going to have to pay this money back"". He said the government's objective is to keep the economy going so ""the UK can bounce back"". Smyth also asked if the test and trace scheme can still keep up with rising cases. Boris Johnson replied that there are ""interesting testing technologies"" being developed but added ""for the moment we have to use the tools we've got"". On vaccines, Sir Patrick said ""things are progressing well"" but suggest ""the widespread use of vaccines isn't going to be until spring next year"". Richard Partington of the Guardian asks the PM and the chancellor why the government was prepared to ""go to the wall"" over Â£5m with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham during the tier three negotiations, when they were preparing to announce ""billions of pounds"" more support in today's expansion. Boris Johnson says the negotiations between regional leaders and the government was ""all about fairness"" and making sure ""everybody got the same package"". He said No 10 is looking to address the national picture now and change with the evolving virus situation. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks if today's financial measures are an acknowledgement that ""you were not supporting parts of the north of England properly during the summer"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak replies: ""We want people to have equal support wherever they are."" Rigby also asks Sir Patrick Vallance if he is disappointed that the test and trace scheme is reaching less than 60% of contacts. ""It is very clear there is room for improvement,"" says Sir Patrick. He adds that the ""effectiveness of test and trace is less when the case numbers are high"". Ben Kentish of LBC asks about the latest NHS test and trace figures which showed that just 15% of coronavirus test results were returned within 24 hours. Boris Johnson says he ""shares peoples' frustrations"" and acknowledged the need to improve the situation to get faster turnaround times. He defends the achievements of the scheme as ""colossal"", including the expansion of testing capacity, adding that the ""technology is improving the whole time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income."" She also asks Sir Patrick Vallance about whether people elsewhere in the UK could be facing a ""digital"" Christmas - which is what people in Scotland could be facingafter a warning from the clinical director there. Sir Patrick says some level of restrictions will need to be in place ""for a while"" to get case numbers down, but progress is already being seen in some areas of the country. ""A lot depends on what happens now over the next few weeks,"" he adds, insisting the situation must be closely monitored. Yvonne in Surrey asks what would happen to the supply chain in the event of a national or local lockdown. She wants to know what financial help would be available to cover the costs of wages to businesses which have not been specifically told to close but have had a drop in income, due to other businesses in their supply chain being told to close. The PM says No 10 is ""doing everything we can"" to support businesses through the crisis and outlines some of the support and relief measures in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak adds that businesses told to close will be able to get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month for the length of closure and the wages of staff will be paid at two thirds. He adds there are support measures in place for businesses not told to close, announced earlier today. Now onto questions. Liam from Bradford asks how the government will encourage innovative businesses. Boris Johnson replies that business rates are ""unprecedentedly low"". And he adds that the government is investing in skills. Rishi Sunak also points to  government schemes to invest in start-up funds. Sir Patrick Vallance now talks through the government slides. He says the number of infections and people being admitted into hospital are continuing to rise. He adds that the more patients there are with Covid, the more pressure on the healthcare system overall. He says the R rate is growing but is still half of the natural R rate of three - and that this reflects ""the huge effort people have made to adhere to the measures in place"" such as wearing masks and washing hands. ""But the epidemic is still growing,"" he adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister's opening contribution to the news conference was a familiar one. The messy reality of a regional approach in England - with rules different here from they are there - represents a pragmatic approach to the pandemic, he claims. Why? The two alternatives, Boris Johnson argues, would be worse: lockdown, or letting the virus rip. It is a longstanding technique in political speech writing to paint your opponents as occupying relatively extreme positions either side of your own. But in this instance is also the crux of the government's argument: seemingly arbitrary rules, changing rapidly and varying geographically, might seem baffling, but they're better, or less worse, than doing anything else.

Nottingham now has the fifth highest rate in England, behind Knowsley, Blackburn with Darwen, Rossendale and Liverpool. The city and county of Nottinghamshire are still waiting to hear whether they will be made subject to tier three restrictions in the coming days. A meeting between local leaders and a government minister was due to take place at 16:30. During his coronavirus briefing, televised live on BBC One this afternoon, Boris Johnson said he wanted to travel ""a middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus"". Scylla is a monster from Greek mythology who lived on a rock. While Charybdis refers to a nearby deadly whirlpool. Heroic figures such as Odysseus would have to pick a careful course between the two foes to avoid being eaten or drowned.

Two in five children aged 11 to 16 in England feel the coronavirus lockdown has made their lives worse,an NHS report on mental health suggests. They said their biggest anxieties were about missing school and family and friends contracting Covid-19. Mental disorders have risen across both genders since 2017. In boys, they rose from 11% to 16% and in girls from 10% to 15%, the report found. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, described the increase as ""extremely alarming"" and called for a properly-funded children's mental health service and for every school to have its own NHS-funded counsellor. The report is based on a survey of 3,570 children and young people up to the age of 22 who were interviewed in 2017 and followed up online in July during the coronavirus pandemic. Responding to questions about whether West Yorkshire could move into tier three, a statement just issued by Leeds City Council says: âWe are awaiting further talks with government regarding restrictions that are in place to tackle coronavirus in Leeds. ""At this current time we are not expecting tier status to change in Leeds this week.â Earlier today the government said discussions with West Yorkshire (Bradford, Leeds, Kirklees, Calderdale, Wakefield) about moving to the very high alert level were ongoing. Rishi Sunak has given an interview to explain the new measures he is taking to adapt his Winter Economic Plan, reflecting new regional restrictions in England. ""I've always said that we would need to adapt our
financial support as the situation evolves,"" he said. ""That's why today we're
announcing three measures that will ensure that we can protect more jobs and
support more businesses through the difficult winter months ahead."" Mr Sunak added he has always said he would ""adapt and evolve our support as the health situation
changes and that's clearly what's happened over the past few weeks"". Employers, he said, ""believe in the principle that this is a shared
endeavour that they want to support their employees alongside the government
and taxpayer, and they think it's right that employees are doing some work"". He ends with a message to people in England: ""Whether you're in a tier two
area [or a] tier three area, we've got support in place for you on a national basis"". A timely reminder as to the reason why you are seeing the prime minister and the chanellor together addressing BBC One viewers in the afternoon. The latest daily update shows the UK recorded another 21,242 coronavirus cases according to thegovernment's dashboard,external, while a further 189 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. The Spanish Canary Islands, the Maldives, Denmark and the Greek island of Mykonos have been added to the UK's list of travel corridors, the transport secretary has announced. Writing on Twitter, Grant Shapps said people returning from these destinations from 04.00 BST on Sunday will no longer need to self-isolate for two weeks. However, Liechtenstein has become the only country to lose its exemption this week, meaning people returning from the country will need to quarantine on their return. Allow Twitter content?

Lastly, Jane Kirby of the Press Association asked Sir Patrick Vallance if a decent level of roll-out of a potential vaccine is achieved by next spring, how soon people might be able to stop social distancing and wearing face coverings. She asked the PM if he would reconsider his opposition to a national circuit break - a short, sharp lockdown - if those in Northern Ireland and Wales are shown to be more effective than tier three restrictions in England. Sir Patrick replies first, insisting he will not speculate on how effective the vaccines are going to be, but says once we know how effective they are, it could be determined ""how to use them best"". ""Clearly the aim of vaccination is to try to take most of the load of the infection spread onto the vaccine in order to be able to relieve other measures and that's got to be an aim we would all wish for,"" he adds. The PM said a national circuit break would be ""very damaging"" economically, socially and mentally for the country. ""We do think the local measures are right, and I repeat my gratitude to local leadership across the country, people who are helping to get the R rate down across their neighbourhoods... and that's what we're going to continue with."" Chris Smyth from the Times asked if the level of financial help will be available until a vaccine is in widespread use. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Job Support Scheme will last for at least six months through to the spring with a review point halfway through. Boris Johnson said ""billions more is going in to support jobs and livelihoods"" but adds ""we are going to have to pay this money back"". He said the government's objective is to keep the economy going so ""the UK can bounce back"". Smyth also asked if the test and trace scheme can still keep up with rising cases. Boris Johnson replied that there are ""interesting testing technologies"" being developed but added ""for the moment we have to use the tools we've got"". On vaccines, Sir Patrick said ""things are progressing well"" but suggest ""the widespread use of vaccines isn't going to be until spring next year"". Richard Partington of the Guardian asks the PM and the chancellor why the government was prepared to ""go to the wall"" over Â£5m with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham during the tier three negotiations, when they were preparing to announce ""billions of pounds"" more support in today's expansion. Boris Johnson says the negotiations between regional leaders and the government was ""all about fairness"" and making sure ""everybody got the same package"". He said No 10 is looking to address the national picture now and change with the evolving virus situation. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks if today's financial measures are an acknowledgement that ""you were not supporting parts of the north of England properly during the summer"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak replies: ""We want people to have equal support wherever they are."" Rigby also asks Sir Patrick Vallance if he is disappointed that the test and trace scheme is reaching less than 60% of contacts. ""It is very clear there is room for improvement,"" says Sir Patrick. He adds that the ""effectiveness of test and trace is less when the case numbers are high"". Ben Kentish of LBC asks about the latest NHS test and trace figures which showed that just 15% of coronavirus test results were returned within 24 hours. Boris Johnson says he ""shares peoples' frustrations"" and acknowledged the need to improve the situation to get faster turnaround times. He defends the achievements of the scheme as ""colossal"", including the expansion of testing capacity, adding that the ""technology is improving the whole time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg challenges the chancellor on the ""problems"" with the first version of the Job Support Scheme and the changes to it. The chancellor replies that the government will adapt and resolve its financial aid response ""as the situation adapts and changes and as health restrictions change"". ""Ultimately what we're trying to do is to protect peoples' jobs and income."" She also asks Sir Patrick Vallance about whether people elsewhere in the UK could be facing a ""digital"" Christmas - which is what people in Scotland could be facingafter a warning from the clinical director there. Sir Patrick says some level of restrictions will need to be in place ""for a while"" to get case numbers down, but progress is already being seen in some areas of the country. ""A lot depends on what happens now over the next few weeks,"" he adds, insisting the situation must be closely monitored. Yvonne in Surrey asks what would happen to the supply chain in the event of a national or local lockdown. She wants to know what financial help would be available to cover the costs of wages to businesses which have not been specifically told to close but have had a drop in income, due to other businesses in their supply chain being told to close. The PM says No 10 is ""doing everything we can"" to support businesses through the crisis and outlines some of the support and relief measures in place. Chancellor Rishi Sunak adds that businesses told to close will be able to get grants of up to Â£3,000 per month for the length of closure and the wages of staff will be paid at two thirds. He adds there are support measures in place for businesses not told to close, announced earlier today. Now onto questions. Liam from Bradford asks how the government will encourage innovative businesses. Boris Johnson replies that business rates are ""unprecedentedly low"". And he adds that the government is investing in skills. Rishi Sunak also points to  government schemes to invest in start-up funds. Sir Patrick Vallance now talks through the government slides. He says the number of infections and people being admitted into hospital are continuing to rise. He adds that the more patients there are with Covid, the more pressure on the healthcare system overall. He says the R rate is growing but is still half of the natural R rate of three - and that this reflects ""the huge effort people have made to adhere to the measures in place"" such as wearing masks and washing hands. ""But the epidemic is still growing,"" he adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister's opening contribution to the news conference was a familiar one. The messy reality of a regional approach in England - with rules different here from they are there - represents a pragmatic approach to the pandemic, he claims. Why? The two alternatives, Boris Johnson argues, would be worse: lockdown, or letting the virus rip. It is a longstanding technique in political speech writing to paint your opponents as occupying relatively extreme positions either side of your own. But in this instance is also the crux of the government's argument: seemingly arbitrary rules, changing rapidly and varying geographically, might seem baffling, but they're better, or less worse, than doing anything else.

"Losing access to EU databases could make identifying people with a criminal history harder Many more EU citizens with criminal records will be barred from entering the UK from January, the Home Office has said. People sentenced to more than a year in prison will be turned away, in line with other foreign nationals. Previously, officials had to show EU offenders presented a serious threat. But there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make it harder to identify foreign criminals, BBC home editor Mark Easton said. With the UK in a transition period since it formally left the EU in January, an EU citizen can currently only be refused entry if they present a genuine, present and serious threat. Patel sets out post-Brexit immigration plans Will there be security co-operation after Brexit? How will the UK points-based immigration system work? Regulations being laid in Parliament on Thursday set out the new rules for when the transition period ends, which treat EU and non-EU citizens the same. The new rules mean from 1 January: Any EU citizen sentenced to at least a year in prison will be barred EU citizens who have committed any criminal offence in the past year could also be barred EU citizens could also be banned if they were sentenced to less than a year in jail, with officials reviewing their full criminal history and links to the UK Offenders who have not served a prison sentence could still be barred if there is evidence they are ""persistent"" criminals, they cause ""serious harm"" or their presence in the UK is not ""conducive to the public good"" People involved in a sham marriage could be banned from entry, and anyone breaching customs regulations could also be turned away. The changes also mean EU citizens found rough sleeping could be deported if they refuse support from authorities, such as the offer of accommodation, as is already the case for non-EU citizens. Officials said this could apply to people living on the streets who commit crimes or act in anti-social ways, such as aggressively begging. But they said it would be a last resort and checks would be carried out to ensure the rough sleepers were not victims of modern slavery or trafficking. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The regulations could mean tens of thousands of people from Europe can no longer enter the UK. But with no long-term agreement on trade and other areas of co-operation with the EU when the transition agreement expires, the UK faces losing access to the European Criminal Records Information System and the EU's passenger database. That could make it harder to identify arrivals with a criminal history. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the rules would be ""firmer and fairer"", applying the same rules on criminality to people from all countries. EU citizens living in Britain who have immigration status under the EU Settlement Scheme, or any others who are protected by the Withdrawal Agreement, are exempt from these rules. However, the Home Office said that their status could be revoked if they commit a crime after 1 January if it results in a prison sentence of more than a year.

"A man purporting to be Banksy asked an assumed onlooker to move away Banksy's spray painting of a Tube carriage showed London Underground was ""not safe"", the RMT union has said. A video posted on the artist's Instagram in July showed a man, thought to be Banksy, disguised as a cleaner. He was wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and used equipment Tube staff would use to disinfect trains. Transport for London said the Tube was safe but the RMT, which many Tube staff belong to, said it was not a lapse in security but showed ""there wasn't any"". The work by Banksy, called If You Don't Mask, You Don't Get,featured a number of rats in pandemic-inspired poses and wearing face masks. It wasremoved by TfL cleaning crewswho were said to be unaware it was a Banksy artwork and treated it ""like any other graffiti on the network"". The transport authority has now confirmed to the BBC, in response a Freedom of Information Act request, that it had completed an investigation into the incident but would not release its findings because of security concerns and not wanting to encourage copycats. TfL said the artist carried out the graffiti between Barbican and Paddington on the Hammersmith and City Line between 05:24 and 06:31 on 10 July. It also confirmed it had no involvement with either the artist, his staff or lawyers. This video can not be played Coronavirus inspired Banksy artwork appears on Tube The footage also showed the artist painted the words ""I get lockdown"" on a wall right at the end of a station platform. TfL would not say which station it was but confirmed the artist did not go on the tracks. A spokesperson for the RMT said some stations had no gate-line staff at certain times of the day so people could ""literally walk on there with anything they like"". ""You can have a coffin under your arm let alone a canister full of paint,"" he said. He said the union had been campaigning over staffing levels because the stations were unstaffed for ""long periods of time and the end result is anything could happen"". ""What happened with a canister full of paint is actually very minor, considering what could have happened."" Safety has been a point of contention between the unions and TfL over the past few years, when theservice underwent job cuts as ticket offices were closed. On its website,external, TfL says it funds 2,500 police officers to work across London's transport network to keep people safe. The BBC has approached TfL for a statement. 'Missing' Banksy gorilla appears at auction Banksy claims hula-hooping girl artwork Ministers agree two-week TfL bailout extension Security consultant Will Geddes said it was difficult for Tube staff to check everyone to make sure they were who they appeared to be - for example, a cleaner. He said a balance had to be struck as TfL did not want to hold people up by having airport-style security. ""It's a bit of a human rights issue,"" he said. ""If you were to go to the Tube station, you would be very affronted if someone was asking you questions about why you were wearing that particular jacket today, or that hat or whatever it might be."" Mr Geddes said the wearing of face masks on the Tube was a security risk as it meant criminals were harder to spot. Brian Woodhead, Director of Customer Service for London Underground, said: ""The safety of our customers and staff is always our primary concern, and ensuring the security of our network is a key part of that. ""We work closely with our station staff, our trade unions and with partners including the British Transport Police to ensure that the network is as secure as possible.""

"Demand in pubs and restaurants has collapsed after bans on households mixing were introduced in many areas Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to unveil new support for workers and firms hit by restrictions imposed as coronavirus cases rise across the UK. He is due to update the Job Support Scheme, which replaces furlough in November, in the Commons on Thursday. Critics say not enough is being done for firms in tier two areas that have seen demand collapse without being formally required to shut. In tier three areas, firms ordered to shut get emergency support. Talks were held throughout Wednesday, with the government said to have acknowledged that while there are three tiers of alert level - medium, high, and very high - there are only two tiers of support. Will coronavirus mean I have to pay more tax? What is changing after furlough? What Covid tier is my area in? Alert system explained... with cake Businesses in tier two areas, particularly in the hospitality sector, have complained that they would be better off if they were under tier three restrictions. They argue that although they would be forced to close, they would benefit from greater government support. Top London-based chef Yotam Ottolenghi said conditions for his restaurants were ""terrible"". ""We are on our knees now,"" he told the BBC. ""We just don't have customers coming through the door."" He said that before tier two restrictions were imposed in London, his restaurants were operating at 50% of capacity, but that this had now fallen to between 10% and 20%. ""This is just not a viable place for a restaurant to be,"" he said, describing tier two as a ""cursed"" category that ""deprives us of oxygen"". In tier three areas, the government will pay 67% of affected workers' wages, up to Â£2,100 a month, from 1 November (""lockdown Job Support Scheme"" in the chart below). Some workers can also claimUniversal Credit. But in tier two regions, the only help available will be the standard JSS (""part-time Job Support Scheme"" in the chart below), which is more costly for employers. Business groups and unions say this means many firms will not be able to use it and will have to lay off workers instead. The chancellor's spokesperson said: ""What we have always said is that our package of support is always flexible, and always up for review, to make sure that it is dealing with the situation as it evolves."" Areas in tier two - the second-highest risk level - include London, Essex, much of the West Midlands, Leicester, Nottinghamshire, Cheshire, West Yorkshire and north-east England. Coventry is to move to tier two Covid restrictions from midnight on Friday, the city council has said. In addition to national restrictions meaning pubs and restaurants must close by 22:00, people in tier two areas are banned from mixing with other households indoors - hammering demand in many leisure industries. Key Conservative figures, such as West Midlands Mayor Andy Street, have been critical of the disparities, along with a raft of Labour local leaders and MPs. Furlough and redundancy are cutting incomes - and millions of people's finances are not in a position to cope. Some 12 million people in UK have low financial resilience - meaning they find it hard to pay bills or make loan repayments, according to research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that those from a black and minority ethnic background have been more likely than most to be affected by Covid-related falls in income, with 37% of those surveyed taking a hit. Also, people aged between 25 and 34 were the most likely, by far, to have had a change in employment as a result of the pandemic. That has led thousands of people to take payment ""holidays"" - deferrals on household bills such as rent or energy bills. From 31 October, anyone who arranges a break on repayments of mortgages, loans and credit cards will see their credit record marked - potentially making it harder to borrow more from then on. Payment holidays: 'I can't afford to be out of work' Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC it was ""one of the oddities of the system"" that pubs and restaurants in tier three areas which had been forced to close were in a better position than those in tier two areas which remained open. ""You get full support, whereas if you're in tier two, you get no more support than similar businesses in the rest of the country and yet demand for your products is clearly massively reduced,"" he added. Mr Johnson said it was clearly right that the government should seek to close that support gap with new measures. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, told the BBC: ""We have a big distinction between tier one, tier two and tier three restrictions in theory, but the economic support packages don't go alongside those restrictions."" This video can not be played People in Barnsley town centre react to tier three restrictions being announced As more parts of the country are placed in tier two, critics say the standard JSS is likely to fall short, with many fewer firms than expected signing up. Options being discussed in Whitehall include more generous taxpayer wage support for businesses in these regions, up from the current level of 22%, and grants offered through local authorities. With so much of England now in tier two, even small increases in support could end up being very expensive. Business and union leaders will be briefed on the changes on Thursday. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules It comes amid warnings that unemployment could rise as high as 8.5% in the first half of next year without more government support for struggling businesses. In the three months to August,redundancies rose to their highest level since 2009, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

"This video can not be played People in Barnsley town centre react to tier three restrictions being announced South Yorkshire will move into tier three from 00.01 on Saturday, meaning 7.3 million people in England will be living under the toughest Covid rules. Sheffield City region mayor Dan Jarvis said the move followed ""extensive discussions"" with ministers. The rules will apply to all council areas in South Yorkshire - Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. Greater Manchester will be placed in the same tieron Friday, against local leaders' wishes. Under tier three - England's ""very high"" level of alert which is already in place in Lancashire and Liverpool City Region - pubs and bars that do not serve substantial meals have to close, and there are further restrictions on households mixing. Additional rules in South Yorkshire include the closure of betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos, soft play centres and gym classes - though gyms will remain open. Meanwhile,Coventry is to move to tier two from midnight on Friday,the city council has said, which will prevent households from mixing in homes and hospitality venues. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to make an announcement relating to support for workers and businesses affected by tier two restrictions in the House of Commons on Thursday. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said the government is understood to have acknowledged the reality that there are three tiers of pandemic shutdowns but only two tiers of support, with some firms suffering a collapse in business without being able to benefit fromthe Job Support Scheme. Starmer attacks 'miserly' Johnson in Covid cash row Hospitality sector 'thrown under a bus' 'Tier 3 will be short, sharp shock that's needed' It comes as a further 26,688 new coronavirus cases were recorded onWednesday,external, while another 191 people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. It is the highest ever number of recorded daily cases. However, mass testing was not available during the peak of the pandemic, when daily cases wereestimated to have reached as many as 100,000. Health minister Edward Argar told MPs there have been more than 12,000 cases in South Yorkshire so far in October - more than in July, August and September combined - while the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has reached more than half that seen at the height of the pandemic. He said he was aware the measures would ""entail further sacrifice"", but ""bearing down hard"" would help to slow the spread of coronavirus. Doncaster's infection rate was 316 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending 17 October, compared to 370 in Rotherham, 395 in Sheffield and 415 in Barnsley. Local leaders in South Yorkshire have agreed to a financial package of Â£41m, which includes Â£30m to support the region's businesses and Â£11m for local authorities to support public health measures like contact tracing. Mr Jarvis said it was the ""responsible route"" and that ""inaction was not an option"" after its hospital admissions doubled in 10 days. He insisted he had ""moved heaven and earth to secure the maximum amount"" of support for the region, which he said would help to reduce the re-infection rate and pressure on the NHS, while supporting the local economy. It comes a day after new restrictions were imposed on Greater Manchester after talks with local leaders, who had called for at least Â£65m, broke down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Â£60m offered to Greater Manchester to support businesses and workers affected by the new restrictionswould be distributed to the region's boroughs. We all knew it was coming. But I was still surprised when the announcement leapt into my inbox at 09:02 BST this morning. Over a million people in South Yorkshire are to go into tier three on Saturday. The phone started ringing and it hasn't stopped yet. Agreed - or imposed? It depends who you talk to. It has been signed off by South Yorkshire but it doesn't mean all the leaders are happy about how it happened. Chris Read, the Rotherham Council leader, is angrier than I've ever seen him. He says it wasn't a negotiation at all - just the government telling South Yorkshire what it was prepared to offer. His point is if that was the case, why not do it a week earlier? Miriam Cates, the Conservative Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, says it's a fair deal and heaped praise on Labour mayor Dan Jarvis. We're all digesting how it will affect us day to day. People will be working out how to run their businesses, provide childcare and take care of their mental health. A review is coming in 28 days but there is no magic number for when an area comes out of tier three. People in South Yorkshire are being asked to bear the toughest restrictions, without knowing when they'll end. The government's three-tier strategy of regional measures is designed to avoid a national lockdown. Any areas in tier three will have its status reviewed after 28 days, the prime minister said. What Covid tier is my area in? How many cases are in my area? The simplest way for areas to get out of those restrictions was to get the reproduction number, the rate at which the virus is spreading, down to one or below, Boris Johnson told MPs. Rates of admission to hospital and other data would also be taken into account, he added. Mr Jarvis said it would be ""very challenging"" for his region to come out of tier three in 28 days ""given the pressures of winter"", but urged people to renew their efforts to ensure all local authorities had a ""fighting chance"" of coming out by then. Other areas in tier two but known to be in discussions about tighter restrictions are West Yorkshire, the North East, Teesside and Nottinghamshire. Talks between council leaders and No 10 about moving the North East into tier threehave been ""paused""following a fall in the region's infection rate over the past week. David Mellen, leader of Nottingham City Council, saidno ""serious conversations"" have been scheduled with ministers or senior civil servants, but he would expect any economic deal to be as good as other areas have received. Jamie Hawksworth, who owns the Sheffield Tap, said he saw the new restrictions coming - but that won't lessen the impact.
