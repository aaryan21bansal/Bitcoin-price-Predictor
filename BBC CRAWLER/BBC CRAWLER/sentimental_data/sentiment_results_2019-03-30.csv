"Police said a man had been waving a St George's flag before he was arrested for trespassing Eurostar passengers faced major disruption after a protester caused trains to and from St Pancras International to be suspended. British Transport Police (BTP) said a man had been in ""a precarious position"" near the station since Friday evening. Southeastern services heading towards St Pancras from Faversham and Margate were also affected. A man, 44, has been arrested for trespass and obstruction of the railway. BTP confirmed eyewitness reports the man was waving an English flag. It follows a day where thousands of people protested in central London over delays to Brexit. No Eurostar trains were able to leave or arrive at St Pancras throughout most of Saturday morning Power to the overhead lines was switched off, so trains could not enter or leave St Pancras. Shortly after 11:00 GMT, National Rail said Eurostar services started running again - but warned passengers to check before they travelled. Allow Twitter content?

"The Unite union said the ""threat of closure couldn't come at a worse time"" Hundreds of workers from Swindon's Honda factory have taken part in a protest through the town urging the company not to close the plant. Last month Honda confirmed it would close the car plant in 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Unite union said the ""decision couldn't come at a worse time"" and it would ""fight to keep Honda in Swindon"". A Honda spokesman said it ""recognised this is an unsettling time for our associates and the local community"". The Japanese company builds 160,000 Honda Civics a year in Swindon -  its only car factory in the EU. The plant in Swindon is Honda's only car factory in the EU Patrick Renard, who works at Honda Logistics in Ghent in Belgium and is chairman of the European Workers Council Honda, travelled from Switzerland to support the workers. He said: ""I do strongly believe there is a future for this plant in the global Honda world - so the Swindon factory has to stay open. ""It is the backbone of Honda in Europe for the last 30 years, so we are pretty sure there will be a domino effect on the rest of Europe. There are production plants in Italy, Spain and France, and we believe this is the first step of Honda leaving Europe as an organisation. ""So it's not only for the Swindon people, it's also for the European people on the continent that I'm here."" Patrick Renard travelled from Switzerland to support the Honda workers in Swindon Steve Preddy, from Unite, said: ""Swindon has had a troubling downturn in its fortunes so this threat of closure couldn't come at a worse time. Too many decent jobs have been lost and not replaced. That hurts a community, as you can see it in the high street. ""It would be a tragedy if Honda walks away from a town that has given that company so much, sending a loyal workforce to the dole queue. We can't and won't let that happen."" Speakers at the event included Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey Business Secretary Greg Clark said he would continue to try to persuade Honda to reverse its decision. He said: ""I will continue to work jointly with associates, the trade unions, suppliers, Swindon Council, local MPs and the whole local community to make a joint case that is compelling and shows with evidence that this decision should be reversed."" A Honda spokesman said: ""We are consulting on this proposal with our associates and their representatives. It is not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this consultation or comment on its activities. ""There is no time limit on how long consultation will last, however we anticipate that this will be longer than the minimum 45 days required by law.""

"The suspect is currently charged with a single murder The man accused of killing 50 people in attacks on two New Zealand mosques has lodged a formal complaint over his prison treatment, media say. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, has so far been charged with one murder and is expected to face further charges. A source told news website Stuff the prisoner had said he was being denied access to visitors and phone calls. He is being kept in isolation at the Auckland Prison in Paremoremo, considered New Zealand's toughest. Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded New Zealand is still coming to terms with the mass killings.More than 20,000 people attended a memorial serviceaddressed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Christchurch's Hagley Park on Friday. The prisoner was flown to Auckland Prison immediately after his first court appearance, in Christchurch on 16 March, a day after the attacks. Stuff says the prisoner complained to the Department of Corrections,externalthat he was being deprived of his basic rights, specifically phone calls and access to visitors. One private visitor a week for at least 30 minutes and at least one telephone call a week are part of the minimum entitlement under the the Corrections Act, along with sufficient food and drink, bedding, healthcare and exercise. The Department of Corrections source told Stuff: ""He's under constant observation and isolation. He doesn't get the usual minimum entitlements. So no phone calls and no visits."" According to the Department of Corrections website, ""prisoners have the right to be treated with humanity, dignity and respect while in prison"". However, the department can apply exceptions to the entitlement under certain circumstances. Al Noor mosque, the site of one of the attacks Entitlements can be withheld if prisoners are segregated ""for purposes of security, good order, or safety, or for the purpose of protective custody"". This can also apply if the security of the prison, or the safety of any person, is threatened. A Department of Corrections spokesperson confirmed to New Zealand media that the prisoner had had no access to any media or visitors. The spokesperson said the suspect was being managed according to the Corrections Act and ""for operational security reasons no further information will be provided"". Stuff says it is thought the prisoner has a door that leads to a concrete yard which he can use for one hour a day. He is said to be ""compliant"". He has been remanded until 5 April and has not yet entered a plea. He is expected to appear at further hearings in Christchurch via video link. So far just a single count of murder, though more charges are expected. Fifty people were killed in attacks on two mosques on 15 March. Part of the attack was livestreamed on Facebook. A court has ruled the suspect's face should be pixellated in photographs. It is thought he will represent himself in court. Friday's memorial service carried appeals for the rejection of extremism and embracing of humanity.

We never have been, but we can be the nation that discovers the cure."" This video can not be played New Zealanders came together to pay respect to those killed in the mosque attacks Farid Ahmed, who survived the attack but whose wife Husna was killed, made a plea for peace, saying he had forgiven the gunman.

"This video can not be played Tense scenes unfold at the Gaza-Israel border fence area Tens of thousands of Palestinians have demonstrated in Gaza to mark the anniversary of the start of weekly protests on the boundary with Israel. Demonstrators threw stones and burned tyres, with Israeli troops using tear-gas and live rounds in response. Three protesters died in the clashes, Palestinian officials say, with another killed earlier on Saturday. The protests back the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel. At least 189 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed between March and December 2018, the UN says. A UN inquiry says Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes during the protest marches - a charge Israel rejects. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Life in the Gaza Strip This day of protests is a serious test of the fragile calm between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip, says the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimated the number of protesters at about 40,000 and several thousand Israeli troops were deployed along the border. The IDF said explosive devices had been thrown over the border fence and Israeli forces had responded with ""riot dispersal means"" and live bullets. The protests come after a tense week in Gaza Three Palestinian protesters, all teenage boys, have been killed and more than 300 have been wounded, Palestinian health officials say. The health officials say another man was shot dead by Israeli troops close to the fence overnight. Hamas had said it would try to keep the crowds a safe distance from the fence, with Egyptian and UN mediators trying to prevent further escalation. The clashes were limited in scope and fears of a large number of deaths have not materialised. The protests quietened in the evening. They came after a tense week in which Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel and Israel's air force struck dozens of sites in Gaza. But Palestinian sources say Egyptian mediators have made some progress in reaching a new ceasefire agreement between the Palestinians and Israel. Palestinians have been taking part in protests along the border since 30 March 2018 as part of a campaign dubbed ""the Great March of Return"". Palestinian health officials say thousands of protesters have been hit by live rounds The Israeli government designates Hamas a terrorist group which it says has been seeking to use the protests as a cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. It deployed soldiers along the border fence, who it said were ordered to resort to live fire only when absolutely necessary and when there was an imminent threat. A commission of inquiry was set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Thirty-five of the 189 Palestinian fatalities were children, three were clearly marked paramedics and two were clearly marked journalists, the commission found. The inquiry found reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers had shot at children, medics and journalists,external, even though they were clearly recognisable as such. This video can not be played The BBC's Paul Adams on the issues at the root of the conflict in Gaza Four Israeli soldiers were injured at the demonstrations. One Israeli soldier was killed on a protest day but outside the protest sites, the commission said. Unless undertaken lawfully in self-defence, intentionally shooting a civilian not directly participating in hostilities is a war crime. Israel's acting foreign minister said it rejected the findings outright. ""The Human Rights Council's Theatre of the Absurd has once again produced a report that is hostile, mendacious and biased against Israel,""Israel Katz said,external. ""No-one can deny Israel the right to self-defence and the obligation to protect its citizens and its borders against violent attacks.""

"The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed soon after take-off Details have begun to emerge of the final moments of an Ethiopian Airlines flight which crashed three weeks ago. An anti-stalling system on the plane, a Boeing 737 Max, has been blamed for the disaster which killed all 157 people on board. Soon after take-off -  and just 450ft (137m) above the ground - the aircraft's nose began to pitch down. One pilot,according to the Wall Street Journal,external, said to the other ""pitch up, pitch up!"" before their radio died. The plane crashed only six minutes into its flight. The Wall Street Journal - which says it has spoken to people close to the ongoing investigation - says the information it has ""paints a picture of a catastrophic failure that quickly overwhelmed the flight crew"". Leaks this week from the crash investigation in Ethiopia and in the US suggest an automatic anti-stall system was activated at the time of the disaster. The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) flight-control feature was also implicated in a fatal crash involving a Lion Air flight in Indonesia last October. The Boeing 737 Max went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. All 157 passengers and crew on board were killed during the crash earlier this month An investigation of the Lion Air flight suggested the anti-stall system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea. The Ethiopian authorities have already said there are ""clear similarities"" between the Lion Air incident and the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The airline and authorities have refused to comment on leaks from the investigation. Concerns about the Boeing 737 Max have led to a worldwide grounding of the plane. Boeing has redesigned the software so that it will disable MCAS if it receives conflicting data from its sensors. As part of the upgrade, Boeing will install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. Neither of the two planes that were involved in the fatal crashes carried the alert systems, which are designed to warn pilots when sensors produce contradictory readings. The aircraft update is designed to ensure the MCAS will no longer repeatedly make corrections when a pilot tries to regain control. Boeing is also revising pilot training to provide ""enhanced understanding of the 737 MAX"" flight system and crew procedures. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accident, which took place just minutes after the plane took off from Bole Aiport in Ethiopia Earlier this week, Boeing said that the upgrades were not an admission that the system had caused the crashes. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accidents, but a preliminary report from Ethiopian authorities is expected within days. Boeing has tried to restore its battered reputation, while continuing to insist the 737 Max is safe.

"Mark Zuckerberg wants a common set of rules that all tech companies have to stick to Mark Zuckerberg says regulators and governments should play a more active role in controlling internet content. In an op-ed publishedin the Washington Post,external, Facebook's chief says the responsibility for monitoring harmful content is too great for firms alone. He calls for new laws in four areas: ""Harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability."" It comes two weeks after a gunman used the site to livestream his attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. ""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,"" Mr Zuckerberg writes, adding that Facebook was ""creating an independent body so people can appeal our decisions"" about what is posted and what is taken down. Facebook charged with discrimination over housing ads Can you stop your parents sharing photos of you online? Amol Rajan: The constant influence of dark ads He also describes a new set of rules he would like to see enforced on tech companies. These new regulations should be the same for all websites, he says, so that it's easier to stop ""harmful content"" from spreading quickly across platforms. In brief, Mr Zuckerberg calls for the following things: Common rules that all social media sites need to adhere to, enforced by third-party bodies, to control the spread of harmful content All major tech companies to release a transparency report every three months, to put it on a par with financial reporting Stronger laws around the world to protect the integrity of elections, with common standards for all websites to identify political actors Laws that not only apply to candidates and elections, but also other ""divisive political issues"", and for laws to apply outside of official campaign periods New industry-wide standards to control how political campaigns use data to target voters online More countries to adopt privacy laws like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force last year A ""common global framework"" that means these laws are all standardised globally, rather than being substantially different from country to country Clear rules about who's responsible for protecting people's data when they move it from one service to another The open letter, which will also be published in some European newspapers, comes as the social network faces questions over itsrole in the Cambridge Analytica scandalaround data misuse during election campaigns. The site has also been criticised for failing to stop the spread of footage of the Christchurch killings, in which 50 Muslims died as they prayed. The video was livestreamed to the attacker's Facebook page on 15 March,before being copied 1.5 million times. Mr Zuckerberg's letter did not specifically name these incidents. Facebook has faced criticism for failing to remove the footage live-streamed by the Christchurch attacker However, the site earlier announced that it wasconsidering introducing restrictions on live-streamingin the wake of the Christchurch attacks. On Thursday, it also said thatit would ban white nationalism and separatism from the site. On Friday it also startedlabelling political ads appearing on Facebook in EU countries, showing who the advertiser is, how much they paid and who they've targeted. ""I believe Facebook has a responsibility to help address these issues, and I'm looking forward to discussing them with lawmakers around the world,"" Mr Zuckerberg says.

"The suspect is currently charged with a single murder The man accused of killing 50 people in attacks on two New Zealand mosques has lodged a formal complaint over his prison treatment, media say. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, has so far been charged with one murder and is expected to face further charges. A source told news website Stuff the prisoner had said he was being denied access to visitors and phone calls. He is being kept in isolation at the Auckland Prison in Paremoremo, considered New Zealand's toughest. Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded New Zealand is still coming to terms with the mass killings.More than 20,000 people attended a memorial serviceaddressed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Christchurch's Hagley Park on Friday. The prisoner was flown to Auckland Prison immediately after his first court appearance, in Christchurch on 16 March, a day after the attacks. Stuff says the prisoner complained to the Department of Corrections,externalthat he was being deprived of his basic rights, specifically phone calls and access to visitors. One private visitor a week for at least 30 minutes and at least one telephone call a week are part of the minimum entitlement under the the Corrections Act, along with sufficient food and drink, bedding, healthcare and exercise. The Department of Corrections source told Stuff: ""He's under constant observation and isolation. He doesn't get the usual minimum entitlements. So no phone calls and no visits."" According to the Department of Corrections website, ""prisoners have the right to be treated with humanity, dignity and respect while in prison"". However, the department can apply exceptions to the entitlement under certain circumstances. Al Noor mosque, the site of one of the attacks Entitlements can be withheld if prisoners are segregated ""for purposes of security, good order, or safety, or for the purpose of protective custody"". This can also apply if the security of the prison, or the safety of any person, is threatened. A Department of Corrections spokesperson confirmed to New Zealand media that the prisoner had had no access to any media or visitors. The spokesperson said the suspect was being managed according to the Corrections Act and ""for operational security reasons no further information will be provided"". Stuff says it is thought the prisoner has a door that leads to a concrete yard which he can use for one hour a day. He is said to be ""compliant"". He has been remanded until 5 April and has not yet entered a plea. He is expected to appear at further hearings in Christchurch via video link. So far just a single count of murder, though more charges are expected. Fifty people were killed in attacks on two mosques on 15 March. Part of the attack was livestreamed on Facebook. A court has ruled the suspect's face should be pixellated in photographs. It is thought he will represent himself in court.

"Drugs deaths in Scotland hit record levels in 2017 Ministers are to assemble a taskforce to tackle the rising number of drug deaths in Scotland. Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick said ""radical steps"" were needed to address the ""emergency"". There were 934 drug-related deaths registered in 2017, up 66 on the previous year, with the death rate more than double the UK average. The minister said an expert group would examine the factors behind the deaths and advise on action. Street valium blamed for drug deaths spike Scots drug deaths hit record levels The 2017 total was the highest since records began in 1996 and more than double the 445 deaths a decade earlier. The Scottish government has faced calls to hold a public inquiry into the problem and MPs on the Scottish Affairs committee recently launched their own investigation. Mr FitzPatrick announced the latest plans in an articlein Saturday's Daily Record.,external He wrote: ""I recognise that some people believe a public inquiry would help deliver change. Sadly, these inquiries can often take years to conclude their work. I want us to move considerably faster. ""That is why I will soon be convening an expert group to examine the key drivers of drug deaths and advise on what further changes, either in practice or in the law, could help save lives and reduce harm."" He also voiced support for the introduction of a medically-supervised safe consumption facility in Glasgow to curb street injecting. The creation of such a service, dubbed ""fix rooms"", has the backing of the city council but the Home Office does not support the idea. What are 'fix rooms'? Mr FitzPatrick said: ""The UK government must recognise what Scotland faces in drug deaths is also an emergency. ""It holds the power to decide if a safe consumption facility can get the legal go-ahead, and so far they have rejected it out of hand. ""If the UK government continues to refuse the act, we call on it to pass powers to the Scottish Parliament so we can do what is necessary."" There are currently no drug consumption rooms in the UK, and the Lord Advocate has said setting one up would require the UK governmentto amend the Misuse of Drugs Act. Last year Home Office officials told Glasgow City Council it was aware of certain public health benefits of consumption rooms, but for others reasonsit would not support such a plan. Concerns included law enforcement issues, ethical quandaries for medical professionals and the risk that drug users would travel long distances to use the facility. Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said Scotland was ""experiencing a drug and alcohol crisis"" that was costing thousands of lives each year. She added: ""Scottish Labour has repeatedly pressed the Scottish government to declare a public health emergency in response to this national crisis, and any step taken towards doing so is to be welcomed. ""However, this cannot be kicked into the long grass and must become a national priority for the government and its agencies."" The Scottish Conservatives said the focus should be on showing hard drug users that there is ""a better way"". Health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ""A cross-party approach is needed to deliver results, keep our communities safe, and change lives for the better. ""We need to see a radical new approach to drug and alcohol treatment in Scotland. ""It is clear that 20 years of the current political consensus and treatment policy is not addressing the growing problems and not helping to build a recovery service.""

"Stonemasons working on the Scott Monument take a break in Princes Street Gardens. Edinburgh Castle is in the background Hulking blocks of carved sandstone dominate much of Edinburgh's world-famous New Town but few people who admire the city's beautiful buildings know the human cost of their construction. According to new research, years of breathing in the dust from ornate carvings led to an ""epidemic"" of lung disease among the stonemasons who built the New Town. Records show many of the stonemasons who worked on iconic Edinburgh structures such as the Scott Monument or Old Royal High School on Calton Hill were dead within a few years of completing the projects. Experts say much of the problem was because the work was carried out in unventilated sheds to avoid the worst of the weather. The research also reveals 19th Century stonemasons favoured growing beards and moustaches to try to filter the dust, instead of using the rudimentary respiratory equipment available at the time. Stonemasons carving a griffin destined for the Scott Monument Prof Ken Donaldson, a senior research fellow at the city's Surgeons' Hall Museum, was one of four academics who wrote the paper: Edinburgh's hidden story of stonemasons' silicosis. Silicosis is a long-term lung disease caused by inhaling large amounts of crystalline silica dust, which is usually from working with stone and rock. It causes areas of hardened and scarred lung tissue. Prof Donaldson said: ""There is a weight of evidence from contemporary sources which makes a persuasive case that this is a forgotten occupational health disaster. ""I think the one that really shocked me was the Scott Monument, there were huge of blocks of sandstone that needed shaped and it was mostly getting done in sheds to keep out the wind and rain. ""People just don't know about the unintended consequences of building this beautiful city."" Prof Donaldson said there was no way of recording occupational illness at that time so it was a ""real effort"" to try to get a sense of what was going on. He said: ""These figures are really the tip of the iceberg. I think hundreds of stonemasons will have died from silicosis while building the New Town."" 'Edinburgh from Craigleith Quarry' as painted by John Bell (1793â1861) In 1766, with the city's historic Old Town at bursting point, young Edinburgh architect James Craig won a competition to design what was to become the New Town. Boasting wide boulevards, squares and grand new public buildings, it was the antithesis of the cramped Old Town and it took more than 80 years to complete. It remains a world-renowned example of city planning and is now designated a Unesco world heritage site, due to some of the ""finest public and commercial monuments of the New-classical revival in Europe"". The stone for this grandiose new suburb came from a quarry less than two miles away, at Craigleith, and critically it was a high quartz sandstone - one of the most dangerous for stonemasons to work with. The research paper has figures which show that between 1872 and 1911, 46.1% of Edinburgh's stonemasons died from tuberculosis - significantly higher than the 13.4% rate for all men over the age of 20 in the city. It argues that the implication is that the tuberculosis in the stonemasons recorded was ""silico-tuberculosis"" or silicosis. In October 1852 the Edinburgh News newspaper carried an investigation into masons and their working conditions, describing the problems they encountered from breathing stone dust. The Scott Monument under construction in 1843 The article also carries death rates for masons working on a string of key projects across the New Town. The building of the Scott Monument on Princes Street has the highest rate, with its intensive stone-carvings most likely to blame. The Edinburgh News states 23 men who worked on the project were dead as a result of silicosis four years after its completion while the 1854 edition of Tomlinson's Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts states that 18 out of the 70 stonemasons who worked on the monument died from tuberculosis. Author Charles Tomlinson wrote: ""The sandstone of which the Scottish capital is built has long been evil in repute for producing diseases in the lungs of the masons who work it."" Elsewhere, evidence shows that half of the 30 stonemasons who built a branch of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Bank on George Street in 1831 had succumbed to silicosis 12 years after the scheme had finished. The Old Royal High School on Calton Hill had about 120 stonemasons working on it and the research shows that only 10 of them were alive 24 years after its 1829 completion, all dead as a result of silicosis. Researchers found that the biggest cause of ""stonemasons lung"" was the use of unventilated sheds to cut and shape the stone needed for buildings. The Edinburgh News article describes how standing at one end of a 40ft mason's shed, the men at the far end ""were all but invisible"", with the sheds described as ""nothing better than a place of human sacrifice"". The few pictures of the masons at work building Edinburgh's New Town available show a sea of mandatory cloth caps but not much in the way of safety wear. According to the research paper, many it seems were content with growing a beard and moustache to try to filter the dust which, perhaps not surprisingly, had little impact. But the research team found that an alternative was available at the time. A Reverend Mr Nisbet of the Canongate, Edinburgh, had designed what looks like a modern respirator with ties to secure around the mouth and nose, and a cloth filter to trap fine dust. However, it seems take-up among masons was virtually non-existent. In 1824, WP Alison, a professor of medicine in Edinburgh, reviewed tuberculosis cases in the Scottish capital. He said: ""I have reason to believe that there is hardly an instance of a mason regularly employed in hewing stones in Edinburgh living free from phthisical [wasting] symptoms to the age of 50."" Almost 200 years on, the problem still remains. A study for an occupational medicine publication found that between 2007 and 2013, six stonemasons between the ages of 24 and 39 were found to have developed silicosis while working in Edinburgh. It found three had severe debilitating versions of the disease, one was awaiting a lung transplant, and all had lost their jobs. The study states that none had had effective protection from dust and all had used powered chisels, angle grinders and saws, causing heavy exposure, with the report stating that ""none had been aware of the risks involved in their work"". Anthony Seaton, a retired professor of environmental medicine at the University of Aberdeen, and one of the co-authors of the silicosis paper, said: ""The human cost of building the New Town is significant and we need to recognise this. ""People still die from silicosis but there should really be no excuse today. ""Stonemasons need to be aware of the risks, know they need to be regularly checked and wear the appropriate respiratory equipment when working. ""But it is difficult for many, it is their livelihood, and we know that because of the extensive use of sandstone, Scotland is one of the worst places for silicosis."" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) reported that, across the UK, there are about 25 estimated new cases each year with typically between 10 and 20 annual deaths from the condition over the past 10 years. The HSE's reporting system for silicosis is a voluntary one so it is likely the number of modern day stonemasons with the deadly disease is much higher than reported.

"Sectarianism was described as a ""vile cancer"" - and not just connected to football. Football clubs have been warned that the Scottish government will act if they do not root out sectarianism in the sport. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the ""vile cancer"" was a societal problem, and was not just connected to football. But he said there were far too many incidents of sectarianism around football grounds. He said clubs must say how they will tackle the problem - and if not, ""all options"" remain on the table. Police warn of rise in football sectarianism and violence Police Scotland look into sectarian singing and coin throwing It comes after a recent Scottish Police Authority board meeting heard howoffensive behaviour at Scottish football matches had increasedin the last year. Officers have been attacked and spat on and a police horse also required treatment after it was hit with a flare, the board heard. Kris Boyd and Steve Clarke have been subjected to recent sectarian abuse Mr Yousaf also announced an additional Â£530,000 for anti-sectarian organisations, bringing the total allocated to Â£14m since 2012. The government's controversialOffensive Behaviour at Football Act,,externalintroduced in 2012, was repealed in 2018. Sectarianism, once dubbed ""Scotland's shame"", recently returned to the headlines afterKilmarnock manager Steve Clarkehighlighted the verbal abuse he received from Rangers fans. Kilmarnock and ex-Rangers strikerKris Boydalso spoke out about chants he was subjected to by Celtic supporters. Others to have shared their negative experiences of life in the Old Firm spotlight include Chris Sutton andNeil McCann. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Yousaf said he would be prepared to legislate again. Mr Yousaf said licensing laws could be examined among efforts to crack down on offensive behaviour. He said: ""When it comes to legislation, my challenge to the football clubs and others is: 'Show me how you're going to act. Tell me how you're going to root this out'. ""But if you don't then we reserve the right to act. ""And I'll look at legislation we currently have, like licensing laws for example. I'll look at potential solutions like strict liability for example, and we will not rule them out and we will not take them off the table. ""So all the options remain very firmly on the table."" Mr Yousaf said the government would do whatever was within its power to tackle bigotry, including at football, marches and parades or in work places. As he announced grants to projects tackling the issue at school-level, he said education was pivotal. A grant of Â£85,000 was given to Sense Over Sectarianism (SOS), which supports pupils in Glasgow to recognise and combat bigotry and provides training for teachers across the country. Development officer, Mark Adams said: ""In the past 12 months SOS has worked with unprecedented numbers and this funding gives the programme a solid platform to build on and consolidate this success. ""In addition we will be able to once again host the national month of action for Scottish schools which proved very popular in February of this year."" Another project to benefit from the new round of funding was Nil By Mouth, which provides free anti-sectarian education in workplaces. Director Dave Scott said: ""We have seen huge interest in our tackling sectarianism in the workplace programme in recent years with more than 125 employers participating, including more than a third of Scottish local authorities. ""Scotland is bigger, better and bolder than bigotry and this welcome investment in grassroots projects like ours will take that message to schools, colleges, universities, workplaces and communities right across the country and help people find their voices on this issue."" Prof Duncan Morrow, former chair of the independent Advisory Group on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland, said:  ""The past few months have shown that sectarianism remains a problem in Scotland. ""There is no doubting that progress has been made, especially in communities, but it will continue to rear its head if it is not faced and addressed firmly. ""I am pleased that the Scottish government remains committed to tackling sectarianism, and hope that others outside of government will now show the leadership that has been lacking for so long.""

Retired banker Irini Tzortzoglou has won this year's MasterChef - and quickly said she has no plans to start a new career running a restaurant. The 61-year-old triumphed in the BBC One show's first all-female final. For the final three-course challenge, she cooked red mullet with a squid risotto, griddled rosemary lamb chops and a fig and hazelnut baklava. Irini, who took inspiration from her Greek childhood, grew up in Crete and now lives in Cartmel, Cumbria. She was one of 56 amateur chefs who competed for the coveted MasterChef trophy in the show's 15th series. Over the course of several gruelling rounds of cooking challenges, they were whittled down to the final three. Irini was particularly pleased to have been in the show's first all-female final and said she wished she could have shared her trophy with her fellow finalists Jilly McCord and Delia Maria Asser. Irini beat off competition from Delia Maria Asser (far left) and Jilly McCord She said: ""It happened so quickly that I felt all the final that the three of us were like one. ""We were all doing our own thing, but actually we were in unison - so my instinctive reaction was: 'Can I share it? Can I share it with my friends?'"" Irini continued: ""We are just lucky we are three women who love and respect each other and have grown to be very fond and appreciative of each other's talents."" Irini Tzortzoglou said she wouldn't follow past winners in opening a restaurant Irini said being filmed throughout the series did not bother her because she remained ""totally focused"". In an interview on BBC Breakfast, she said: ""The cameras didn't disturb me because you really need to ignore them if you want to cook. ""And the guys are fantastic, Gregg [Wallace] comes and relaxes you - he used to joke with me about Greek history, challenge me, laugh with me - and then John [Torode] is like a younger brother who cares for you, he wants you to do as well as you want to. ""They didn't bother me at all. In fact, I loved being around them."" Past winners of the show, such as 2005 champion Thomasina Miers and 2011's Shelina Permalloo, have gone on to own their own restaurants. But despite impressing some of the biggest names in the food industry throughout the competition, Irini's future plans do not involve opening her own professional kitchen. ""I don't think that at my time of life I want to run a restaurant,"" she said. ""I want to spend more time with my mum and I would love to go round Greece and do some research - maybe make a programme, if I'm lucky.""

"Dominic Grieve has been a prominent campaigner for another Brexit referendum Conservative MP Dominic Grieve has said he is the victim of an ""orchestrated campaign"" after losing a vote of no confidence brought by his local party.

"Emiliano Sala (left) was heading to his new club, Cardiff City, on board a plane being flown by David Ibbotson The pilot of the plane which crashed into the English Channel with Emiliano Sala on board, was not qualified to fly at night, BBC Wales understands. David Ibbotson is thought to have been colour-blind, and his licence restricted him to flying in daytime hours only. Footballer Sala, 28, died when the plane carrying him from Nantes to Cardiff crashed late on 21 January. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it could not comment. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said licensing ""continues to be a focus"" of its investigations. Regulatory authorities have confirmed that Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, did not hold a ""night rating"" on his UK private pilot's licence, the BBC understands. Who owned the plane? What does the interim air accident report say? Agent: 'The tragic events have shocked us all' Family's tribute to Sala The story of Emiliano Sala His UK licence was mirrored by a US pilot's licence - enabling him to fly the US-registered Piper Malibu in Europe. The public record of his Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licence states Mr Ibbotson ""must have available glasses for near vision"" and that ""all limitations and restrictions on the United Kingdom pilot licence apply"". There is no publicly available record of UK pilot licences, which are held by the CAA. But sources have told BBC Wales that Mr Ibbotson's licence restricted him to ""flights by day only"". The final radar track record - given in the AAIB's interim report An aviation source told BBC Wales that the ability to be able to differentiate between green and red lights is ""key"" to flying in the dark. ""Anything that's on the UK licence applies to the US licence as well, so he couldn't do anything more than the UK licence allows. ""Flying outside the restrictions of your licence is illegal and that's likely to affect the insurance cover for the flight."" Emiliano Sala plane crash: The story behind the transfer flights Emiliano Sala plane crash: Call to investigate more flights European aviation rules define night as ""the time from half an hour after sunset until half an hour before sunrise"". Flight plans seen by BBC Wales indicate the flight scheduled to take Argentine player Sala for his first training session with Cardiff City had been due to leave Nantes airport at 09:00 local time on 21 January. But the flight was postponed until 19:00, at the request of Sala, to allow him to spend the day saying goodbye to his Nantes teammates. By the time Mr Ibbotson taxied a Piper Malibu plane on to the runway ready for take-off shortly after 19:00, it would have been around an hour and 10 minutes since sunset. Air accident investigators' photo showing the rear left side of the fuselage on the seabed Speculation about the legality of the flight has so far centred around the question of whether it complied with restrictions concerning private pilots flying passengers in Europe in a US-registered aircraft. As a private pilot, 59-year-old Mr Ibbotson was not allowed to carry passengers for remuneration or financial reward. A preliminary report from the AIIB, released in February, stated he could only fly passengers on a cost-share basis. As the aircraft was US-registered, pilot and passenger must have a ""common purpose"" for making the journey, and the pilot must dictate when a flight leaves. The report adds that the flight ""must not be made for the purpose of merely transporting the passenger"". Piper Malibu aircraft, N264DB, at Nantes before the fatal flight In an interview in February, football agent Willie McKay, who commissioned the flight, told the BBC that he and his family paid for the flight. He was not involved, he said, in selecting the plane or the pilot and it was not a cost-share arrangement. The plane disappeared off radar north of Guernsey in the Channel Islands at 20:16. Sala's body was recovered from the wreckage of the plane in early February but Mr Ibbotson's body has not been found. Sala posing with a Cardiff City shirt on 20 January, the day before the fatal flight The European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) states that to obtain a night rating, a pilot must undergo five hours of theory and five hours of flight training. In their preliminary report, the AAIB said that because Mr Ibbotson's pilot licence and log book had been lost in the crash, it had not yet been able to establish what ratings he held or how many hours he had flown recently - although it was known he had completed approximately 3,700 flying hours. Investigators would normally look to establish how many hours a pilot had flown in the last 28 and 90 days before a crash.

Meanwhile, New Zealand is to review ""inadequate"" laws on hate speech. Justice Minister Andrew Little said the current laws did not tackle ""the evil and hateful things that we're seeing online"", and that the government and the Human Rights Commission would work to bring forward proposals by the end of the year. Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded Anger as shooter video spreads around world The people killed as they prayed More than 20,000 people attended a memorial service in Christchurch on Fridayto honour the 50 victims of the 15 March shooting. Of the dozens injured, 21 people remain in hospital, three of them in intensive care. ""All of us at Facebook stand with the victims, their families, the Muslim community, and all of New Zealand,""Ms Sandberg wrote in her letter to the New Zealand Herald,external. ""Many of you have also rightly questioned how online platforms such as Facebook were used to circulate horrific videos of the attack... We have heard feedback that we must do more - and we agree."" Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg outlined the company's actions in a letter to a New Zealand newspaper Ms Sandberg said: ""First, we are exploring restrictions on who can go Live depending on factors such as prior Community Standard violations."" Facebook said fewer than 200 people had watched the 17-minute video of the Christchurch shootings while it was live,external, and the first user report of the video came 12 minutes after it ended.

"There's fresh hope for the survival of endangered Tasmanian devils after large numbers were killed off by facial tumours. The world's largest carnivorous marsupials have been battling Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) for over 20 years. But researchers have found the animals' immune system to be modifying to combat the assault. And according to an international team of scientists from Australia, UK, US and France, the future for the devils is now looking brighter. ""In the past, we were managing devil populations to avoid extinction. Now, we are progressively moving to an adaptive management strategy, enhancing those selective adaptations for the evolution of devil/DFTD coexistence,"" explains Dr Rodrigo Hamede, from the University of Tasmania. First discovered in north-eastern Tasmania in 1996, the disease has since spread across 95% of the species' range, with local population losses of over 90%. Dr Hamede's team has been collecting epidemiological evidence over the past 10 years. The group has plotted scenarios based on current infection rates in the wild, andin their forecast for the next 100 years, 57% of scenarios see DFTD fading out and 22% predict coexistence,external. Tumours can become as large as half the size of the face How does the disease spread? The disease is transmitted when devils bite each other's faces during fights. The biting behaviour is a way to socialise and assert dominance which, alongside the growl-like screams, helped earn the devils their nickname. ""Our current hypothesis is that the biting doesn't only lead to the spread of tumours but it might be the starting point,"" explains Max Stammnitz, from the University of Cambridge, UK, who sequences tumour genomes. ""If the scarring processes for the recurring wounds are interrupted by a mutation, this might become cancerous. It fails to heal and starts to grow out into an external tissue that may then become transmissible,"" Mr Stammnitz says. After the bite, a solid tumour then grows around the face or neck, with the power to break bones in the jaw - killing the animal after 6 to 24 months. To worsen the crisis, in 2014, a second transmissible cancer (DFT2) was discovered in wild populations in the south of the island. ""A second transmissible tumour in devils was extremely surprising, like lightning striking the devils twice,"" says Dr Hamede. But in the last 5-6 years, some devils have developed higher tolerance to infection and even resistance without human intervention, meaning that while population numbers have not recovered to pre-DFTD numbers, the decline has at least now levelled out. DFTD can displace teeth or protrude through the eyes and nostrils of the animal How is natural selection helping? ""Natural selection is trying to fix the problem on its own by favouring those who can survive the tumour, so we're more hopeful these days than ever before,"" explains Dr Hamede. The international team monitors eight sites across the east, south and west of the island every three months, observing multiple generations of devils. ""We have witnessed how these tumours shape the ecology of devils and how they have been evolving with their hosts in real time,"" Dr Hamede says. Devils can now adapt to the transmissible cancer at the genetic and phenotypic levels - meaning the DNA and characteristics of the gene traits. This is due to their phenotypic plasticity - the capacity of an individual organism to alter its physiology or gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions. And what's even more unique is how rapidly this has happened - in a matter of 16 years, over just eight devil generations. In some animals, tumours (inset) have completely regressed without any human intervention ""It's a constant arms race of adaptation between animals and diseases. We develop mechanisms of resistance which put pressure on pathogens to improve infection,"" Mr Stammnitz says. The first of these mechanisms is tolerance and the second is resistance. The team has found devils that have lived for up to two years with the disease, allowing for two more litters to serve as population recruitment for the disease. In addition, 23 cases of tumour regression have been found so far - showing devils also have the capacity to fight and recover from DFTD. To study the animals, the researchers must first catch them What is the future for the devils? The second largest threat to devils is roadkill, with a minimum of 350-450 devils killed each year according to Dr Fox from Save the Tasmanian Devil Programme (STDP). Targeting hotspots, the STDP has installed fencing which sounds an alarm and warns wildlife of approaching cars. The current trial has led to a 50% reduction in roadkill since 2015. The number of devils hit has dropped by a quarter and Tasmanian pademelons and Bennett's wallabies have also benefited. Humane traps are used by the team The government has also been trialling a new app since July that members of the public can use to report sightings to help monitor populations. So far, the app has been downloaded by over 2,000 users who have entered 6,000 reports. ""When we tracked the start of DFTD in 2003, road kill reports by the public informed our knowledge of where it had spread showing the power of citizen science to help the devils,"" Dr Fox adds. In the curious case of the Tasmanian devil, there is much still to be learned about cancer biology and the evolutionary arms-race between malignant cells and their hosts. The sheer speed of the decline has created a strong selective pressure on the world's largest remaining carnivorous marsupial but it now seems hope could lie in co-existence.

"This video can not be played Audio recording of the phone call between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Michael Wernick Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under new pressure after his former justice minister released documents relating to a major corruption scandal. Jody Wilson-Raybould says government officials tried to persuade her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution. The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Ms Wilson-Raybould has released the recording of a phone call and other materials to support her accusations. The files, initially given to a parliamentary committee, were released publicly on Friday. They are likely to increase pressure on Mr Trudeau, who is facing a general election later this year and has struggled for weeks to contain the fallout from the controversy. SNC-Lavalin is facing claims that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Gaddafi, who was ousted in 2011. The Liberal prime minister has been accused of pressuring Ms Wilson-Raybould to push for a legal favour for SNC-Lavalin that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties, such as a fine. The affair has seen the prime minister lose two senior ministers - including Ms Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet in February - as well as Canada's top bureaucrat and a senior aide. Mr Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing by either him or his staff. But opinion surveys indicate that the controversy has shaken Mr Trudeau and his government's popularity months before the election, which is due in October. The documents made public include an audio recording, lasting nearly 18 minutes, of a December phone call between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick about the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The former justice minister and attorney general said she took the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step"" of recording the call without Mr Wernick's knowledge because she wanted a precise account of the conversation. She said she was concerned about what she saw as attempts to interfere in the case. In the call, there is a lengthy back and forth between the pair, during which the senior public servant repeatedly notes that the prime minister is interested in having the firm avoid prosecution in favour of an agreement. Mr Trudeau and his officials have said they are concerned that thousands of jobs are at risk if the engineering firm is convicted. Justin Trudeau remains under pressure She pushes back, warning she felt the conversation was inappropriate and that continued communications about the matter could cross the lines of her prosecutorial independence as attorney general. A deepening crisis for Trudeau - what it means Five quotes that sum up the Trudeau crisis ""The recording allows members of the committee to decide for themselves"" about whether or not she was pressured by Mr Wernick, Ms Wilson-Raybould writes. Mr Wernick stepped down as Canada's top civil servantthis month. The Liberal-dominated justice committee dropped the inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair earlier this month, saying its objectives have been achieved. After the committee ended the inquiry, Ms Wilson-Raybould announced that she would submit further materials to back up her testimony. Some 40-pages were released,external, which include copies of texts and emails, as well as Ms Wilson-Raybould's elaboration on her view of the events. Opposition parties had wanted Ms Wilson-Raybould to return to committee following her bombshell testimony in February, where she accused Mr Trudeau and members of his inner circle of spending months trying to politically interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said the new materials provided evidence that Mr Trudeau had told a falsehood and should resign.,external Trudeau loses top civil servant in crisis Ex-senior aide defends Trudeau amid crisis Trudeau denies corruption case wrongdoing Trudeau admits to 'erosion of trust' Trudeau's Liberals end SNC-Lavalin probe Trudeau government faces ethics probe Canada minister quits in interference claim Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Sectarianism was described as a ""vile cancer"" - and not just connected to football. Football clubs have been warned that the Scottish government will act if they do not root out sectarianism in the sport. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the ""vile cancer"" was a societal problem, and was not just connected to football. But he said there were far too many incidents of sectarianism around football grounds. He said clubs must say how they will tackle the problem - and if not, ""all options"" remain on the table. Police warn of rise in football sectarianism and violence Police Scotland look into sectarian singing and coin throwing It comes after a recent Scottish Police Authority board meeting heard howoffensive behaviour at Scottish football matches had increasedin the last year. Officers have been attacked and spat on and a police horse also required treatment after it was hit with a flare, the board heard. Kris Boyd and Steve Clarke have been subjected to recent sectarian abuse Mr Yousaf also announced an additional Â£530,000 for anti-sectarian organisations, bringing the total allocated to Â£14m since 2012. The government's controversialOffensive Behaviour at Football Act,,externalintroduced in 2012, was repealed in 2018. Sectarianism, once dubbed ""Scotland's shame"", recently returned to the headlines afterKilmarnock manager Steve Clarkehighlighted the verbal abuse he received from Rangers fans. Kilmarnock and ex-Rangers strikerKris Boydalso spoke out about chants he was subjected to by Celtic supporters. Others to have shared their negative experiences of life in the Old Firm spotlight include Chris Sutton andNeil McCann. Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Yousaf said he would be prepared to legislate again. Mr Yousaf said licensing laws could be examined among efforts to crack down on offensive behaviour. He said: ""When it comes to legislation, my challenge to the football clubs and others is: 'Show me how you're going to act. Tell me how you're going to root this out'. ""But if you don't then we reserve the right to act. ""And I'll look at legislation we currently have, like licensing laws for example. I'll look at potential solutions like strict liability for example, and we will not rule them out and we will not take them off the table. ""So all the options remain very firmly on the table."" Mr Yousaf said the government would do whatever was within its power to tackle bigotry, including at football, marches and parades or in work places. As he announced grants to projects tackling the issue at school-level, he said education was pivotal. A grant of Â£85,000 was given to Sense Over Sectarianism (SOS), which supports pupils in Glasgow to recognise and combat bigotry and provides training for teachers across the country. Development officer, Mark Adams said: ""In the past 12 months SOS has worked with unprecedented numbers and this funding gives the programme a solid platform to build on and consolidate this success. ""In addition we will be able to once again host the national month of action for Scottish schools which proved very popular in February of this year."" Another project to benefit from the new round of funding was Nil By Mouth, which provides free anti-sectarian education in workplaces. Director Dave Scott said: ""We have seen huge interest in our tackling sectarianism in the workplace programme in recent years with more than 125 employers participating, including more than a third of Scottish local authorities. ""Scotland is bigger, better and bolder than bigotry and this welcome investment in grassroots projects like ours will take that message to schools, colleges, universities, workplaces and communities right across the country and help people find their voices on this issue."" Prof Duncan Morrow, former chair of the independent Advisory Group on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland, said:  ""The past few months have shown that sectarianism remains a problem in Scotland.

"This video can not be played Audio recording of the phone call between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Michael Wernick Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under new pressure after his former justice minister released documents relating to a major corruption scandal. Jody Wilson-Raybould says government officials tried to persuade her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution. The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Ms Wilson-Raybould has released the recording of a phone call and other materials to support her accusations. The files, initially given to a parliamentary committee, were released publicly on Friday. They are likely to increase pressure on Mr Trudeau, who is facing a general election later this year and has struggled for weeks to contain the fallout from the controversy. SNC-Lavalin is facing claims that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Gaddafi, who was ousted in 2011. The Liberal prime minister has been accused of pressuring Ms Wilson-Raybould to push for a legal favour for SNC-Lavalin that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties, such as a fine. The affair has seen the prime minister lose two senior ministers - including Ms Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet in February - as well as Canada's top bureaucrat and a senior aide. Mr Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing by either him or his staff. But opinion surveys indicate that the controversy has shaken Mr Trudeau and his government's popularity months before the election, which is due in October. The documents made public include an audio recording, lasting nearly 18 minutes, of a December phone call between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick about the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The former justice minister and attorney general said she took the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step"" of recording the call without Mr Wernick's knowledge because she wanted a precise account of the conversation. She said she was concerned about what she saw as attempts to interfere in the case. In the call, there is a lengthy back and forth between the pair, during which the senior public servant repeatedly notes that the prime minister is interested in having the firm avoid prosecution in favour of an agreement. Mr Trudeau and his officials have said they are concerned that thousands of jobs are at risk if the engineering firm is convicted. Justin Trudeau remains under pressure She pushes back, warning she felt the conversation was inappropriate and that continued communications about the matter could cross the lines of her prosecutorial independence as attorney general. A deepening crisis for Trudeau - what it means Five quotes that sum up the Trudeau crisis ""The recording allows members of the committee to decide for themselves"" about whether or not she was pressured by Mr Wernick, Ms Wilson-Raybould writes. Mr Wernick stepped down as Canada's top civil servantthis month. The Liberal-dominated justice committee dropped the inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair earlier this month, saying its objectives have been achieved. After the committee ended the inquiry, Ms Wilson-Raybould announced that she would submit further materials to back up her testimony. Some 40-pages were released,external, which include copies of texts and emails, as well as Ms Wilson-Raybould's elaboration on her view of the events. Opposition parties had wanted Ms Wilson-Raybould to return to committee following her bombshell testimony in February, where she accused Mr Trudeau and members of his inner circle of spending months trying to politically interfere in the SNC-Lavalin matter.

"This video can not be played 'I thought we would be treated differently in US' President Donald Trump has said he is likely to close the US border if Mexico does not do more to stop migrants reaching the United States. The closure would disrupt border crossings, threatening trade worth billions of dollars. Mr Trump's threat follows a surge in migrants travelling through Mexico to seek asylum in the US. Mexico's President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said he would not be drawn into confrontation on the issue. US-Mexico border 'at breaking point' Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said in a tweet that Mexico was a ""great neighbour"" to the US and would ""not act on the basis of threats"". Mr Trump told reporters on Friday: ""There's a very good likelihood that I'll be closing the border next week, and that will be just fine with me."" He said it was very easy for Mexico to ""stop people from coming up, but they don't choose to do it"". Queues have been building up at the Mexico-US border The president later wrote a series of tweets which concluded that because the US ""lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc., that the Border closing would be a good thing!"" The US president has also instructed the state department to cut off all direct assistance to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala - where many of the migrants come from. The move has to involve Congress, many of whose members have authorised the monies to tackle the root causes of the migration.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said border patrol staff had been overwhelmed by a huge increase in asylum seekers fleeing violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

Trump reverses migrant separation policy It is unclear how closing entry ports might reduce the number of migrants entering the country, as many arrive at unofficial points of entry and can legally request help the moment they step on US soil. The DHS has moved 750 border staff from entry ports to help process asylum seekers arriving between official crossing points. Ms Nielsen warned Americans that they ""may feel effects from this emergency"". Lack of staffing is already having an impact. Traffic jams at the crossing between Cuidad JuÃ¡rez and El Paso, Texas, were longer than usual on Friday, with one driver claiming she had been stuck for three hours, Reuters news agency reported.

"The catfish was caught in a lake at a shopping centre in Essex A ""rogue"" fish has been removed from a lake after children reported seeing it eating ducks. The 25lb (11.3kg) catfish was caught at the man-made lake at the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, by the Environment Agency (EA). A spokesman said fishing contests would be held at the lake to reduce the population of invasive species. Officer Ben Norrington said: ""Large fish have the potential to eat wildfowl so we're pleased we could remove it."" The EA said the animal had been seen eating ducks and other wildfowl. ""Invasive species pose a serious threat to our native wildlife,"" Mr Norrington added. The catfish has been relocated to a fully enclosed lake with help from the Catfish Conservation Group.

"AirPower was billed by Apple as a ""world-class wireless charging solution"" In a highly unusual step for the firm, Apple has given up on a product because it could not make it work adequately. AirPower, announced in 2017, was a mat meant to charge multiple devices without needing to plug them in. But it is understood the firmâs engineers were perhaps unable to stop the mat from getting too hot. ""After much effort, weâve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project,"" the firm said. The company did not elaborate further. However, rumours of issues with the product had been circulating since its announcement in September 2017. At the time, Apple said it would be released to the public some time in 2018, promising a ""world-class wireless charging solution"". But late last year, with the product absent from the most recent iPhone launch,noted Apple insider Jon Gruber wrote,external: ""There are engineers who looked at AirPowerâs design and said it could never work, thermally, and now those same engineers have that 'told you so' smug look on their faces."" In a statement emailed to the BBC, Dan Riccio, Appleâs head of hardware engineering, said: ""We apologise to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward."" The cancelled product could affect sales of the companyâs wireless headphones - AirPods - which were promoted and sold with the promise they would be charged using AirPower in future. Packaging for the AirPods contained a diagram of how AirPower would work. Appleâs rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly.

"This video can not be played Tense scenes unfold at the Gaza-Israel border fence area Tens of thousands of Palestinians have demonstrated in Gaza to mark the anniversary of the start of weekly protests on the boundary with Israel. Demonstrators threw stones and burned tyres, with Israeli troops using tear-gas and live rounds in response. Three protesters died in the clashes, Palestinian officials say, with another killed earlier on Saturday. The protests back the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel. At least 189 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed between March and December 2018, the UN says. A UN inquiry says Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes during the protest marches - a charge Israel rejects. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Life in the Gaza Strip This day of protests is a serious test of the fragile calm between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip, says the BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimated the number of protesters at about 40,000 and several thousand Israeli troops were deployed along the border. The IDF said explosive devices had been thrown over the border fence and Israeli forces had responded with ""riot dispersal means"" and live bullets. The protests come after a tense week in Gaza Three Palestinian protesters, all teenage boys, have been killed and more than 300 have been wounded, Palestinian health officials say. The health officials say another man was shot dead by Israeli troops close to the fence overnight. Hamas had said it would try to keep the crowds a safe distance from the fence, with Egyptian and UN mediators trying to prevent further escalation. The clashes were limited in scope and fears of a large number of deaths have not materialised. The protests quietened in the evening. They came after a tense week in which Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel and Israel's air force struck dozens of sites in Gaza. But Palestinian sources say Egyptian mediators have made some progress in reaching a new ceasefire agreement between the Palestinians and Israel. Palestinians have been taking part in protests along the border since 30 March 2018 as part of a campaign dubbed ""the Great March of Return"". Palestinian health officials say thousands of protesters have been hit by live rounds The Israeli government designates Hamas a terrorist group which it says has been seeking to use the protests as a cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. It deployed soldiers along the border fence, who it said were ordered to resort to live fire only when absolutely necessary and when there was an imminent threat. A commission of inquiry was set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Thirty-five of the 189 Palestinian fatalities were children, three were clearly marked paramedics and two were clearly marked journalists, the commission found. The inquiry found reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers had shot at children, medics and journalists,external, even though they were clearly recognisable as such. This video can not be played The BBC's Paul Adams on the issues at the root of the conflict in Gaza Four Israeli soldiers were injured at the demonstrations. One Israeli soldier was killed on a protest day but outside the protest sites, the commission said. Unless undertaken lawfully in self-defence, intentionally shooting a civilian not directly participating in hostilities is a war crime. Israel's acting foreign minister said it rejected the findings outright. ""The Human Rights Council's Theatre of the Absurd has once again produced a report that is hostile, mendacious and biased against Israel,""Israel Katz said,external. ""No-one can deny Israel the right to self-defence and the obligation to protect its citizens and its borders against violent attacks.""

"Psychiatrists are being urged to ask children with mental health issues how long they spend online and what they use social media for. Questions about technology should be a routine part of assessments, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. It is concerned about how time spent online impacts on mood, sleep, diet and behaviour. The government is expected to announce plans to regulate social media companies soon. The College's advice comes as evidence grows of a possible link between harmful content or time spent online, and poor mental health. It is planning to publish a report later this year about its stance on technology use and children's mental health, which will include recommendations for parents, children and doctors. When assessing children, psychiatrists are being advised to think about: harmful content, especially material which could impact on an existing mental illness, such as self-harm photos or images which promote eating disorders how problematic technology use could be related to problems with sleep, poor academic performance, low mood and behavioural or eating difficulties how conditions such as depression or eating disorders may make children more likely to spend too long online or use technology in a way that is harmful The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that children stop using technology at least an hour before going to bed, and avoid using technology at mealtimes. This is a view echoed by the Chief Medical Officer in her recent guidance on social media. A group of MPs recently called for a tax on social media companies' profits, saying the firms are operating in ""an online wild west"" and should help fund research into the links between technology use and mental illness. The government is expected to announce plans for an independent regulator which would enforce a new statutory 'duty of care' on social media companies. This comes after growing concerns about graphic online content, including material featuring suicide and self-harm. Earlier this year, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, saidInstagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. How can governments regulate social media? Is young people's mental health getting worse? One in four young women has mental illness Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at RCPsych, said: ""Although we recognise that social media and technology are not primary drivers of mental illness in young people, we know that they are an important part of their lives and can be harmful in some situations. ""As a frontline clinician, I regularly see young people who have deliberately hurt themselves after discussing self-harm techniques online. ""Clinicians recognise the well-known phenomena of young people copying each other's harmful behaviour while on in-patient units, but it's even more worrying to see this replicated in the online world where audiences are so much bigger."" She added: ""We're also finding that some young people report being recommended harmful content; for example, links to websites encouraging weight loss or displaying self-harm after searching for, or clicking on, similar content just once before."" Dr Dubicka said it was important to consider whether social media was affecting children and young people's mental health so that the causes of their distress could be addressed. Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""Young people we work with rarely say that social media is the 'cause' of mental health conditions, but they say it can heighten problems that they are already struggling with, adding to anxiety or making them feel worse when they compare their lives to those of other people."" Claire Murdoch, national director for mental health at NHS England, said: ""Social media plays a big part in everyday life for most children and young people, but it should act as a wake-up call when leading psychiatrists say online activities now need to be considered when assessing youngsters' mental health and wellbeing."" She said the NHS planned to improve access to mental health services for young people but expected social media giants to ""step up to the plate"". Can you talk about self-harm online safely?

"This video can not be played Audio recording of the phone call between Jody Wilson-Raybould and Michael Wernick Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is under new pressure after his former justice minister released documents relating to a major corruption scandal. Jody Wilson-Raybould says government officials tried to persuade her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution. The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Ms Wilson-Raybould has released the recording of a phone call and other materials to support her accusations. The files, initially given to a parliamentary committee, were released publicly on Friday. They are likely to increase pressure on Mr Trudeau, who is facing a general election later this year and has struggled for weeks to contain the fallout from the controversy. SNC-Lavalin is facing claims that former executives paid bribes to win contracts in Libya under Gaddafi, who was ousted in 2011. The Liberal prime minister has been accused of pressuring Ms Wilson-Raybould to push for a legal favour for SNC-Lavalin that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties, such as a fine. The affair has seen the prime minister lose two senior ministers - including Ms Wilson-Raybould, who resigned from cabinet in February - as well as Canada's top bureaucrat and a senior aide. Mr Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing by either him or his staff. But opinion surveys indicate that the controversy has shaken Mr Trudeau and his government's popularity months before the election, which is due in October. The documents made public include an audio recording, lasting nearly 18 minutes, of a December phone call between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Clerk of the Privy Council Michael Wernick about the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The former justice minister and attorney general said she took the ""extraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step"" of recording the call without Mr Wernick's knowledge because she wanted a precise account of the conversation. She said she was concerned about what she saw as attempts to interfere in the case. In the call, there is a lengthy back and forth between the pair, during which the senior public servant repeatedly notes that the prime minister is interested in having the firm avoid prosecution in favour of an agreement. Mr Trudeau and his officials have said they are concerned that thousands of jobs are at risk if the engineering firm is convicted. Justin Trudeau remains under pressure She pushes back, warning she felt the conversation was inappropriate and that continued communications about the matter could cross the lines of her prosecutorial independence as attorney general. A deepening crisis for Trudeau - what it means Five quotes that sum up the Trudeau crisis ""The recording allows members of the committee to decide for themselves"" about whether or not she was pressured by Mr Wernick, Ms Wilson-Raybould writes. Mr Wernick stepped down as Canada's top civil servantthis month. The Liberal-dominated justice committee dropped the inquiry into the SNC-Lavalin affair earlier this month, saying its objectives have been achieved. After the committee ended the inquiry, Ms Wilson-Raybould announced that she would submit further materials to back up her testimony.

"Police said a man had been waving a St George's flag before he was arrested for trespassing Eurostar passengers faced major disruption after a protester caused trains to and from St Pancras International to be suspended. British Transport Police (BTP) said a man had been in ""a precarious position"" near the station since Friday evening. Southeastern services heading towards St Pancras from Faversham and Margate were also affected. A man, 44, has been arrested for trespass and obstruction of the railway. BTP confirmed eyewitness reports the man was waving an English flag. It follows a day where thousands of people protested in central London over delays to Brexit. No Eurostar trains were able to leave or arrive at St Pancras throughout most of Saturday morning Power to the overhead lines was switched off, so trains could not enter or leave St Pancras. Shortly after 11:00 GMT, National Rail said Eurostar services started running again - but warned passengers to check before they travelled. Allow Twitter content?

"There's no point beating about the bush: if you possibly can, go and see this show at Tate Britain. The time and ticket expense (a chunky Â£22 standard price) will be worth it simply to stand in front of Shoes (1886) for a few minutes. It is Van Gogh in top form. Two battered black boots, laces asunder and soles heavy with mud, are left forlornly in the middle of the canvas with no evidence of their exhausted owner. They remind me of late Rembrandt, Vincent's fellow countryman and guiding star, who had the same knack for showing the effects of hard labour with unsentimental honesty. These are the shoes that inspired Beckett's Waiting for Godot and, as you will see in the exhibition, William Nicholson's Miss Jekyll's Gardening Boots (1920). Take your chance to look at Van Gogh's depiction of crusty weariness while you can. You can see the influence of Van Gogh's great work Shoes, 1886 (L) in William Nicholson's painting, Miss Jekyll's Gardening Boots, 1920 (R) It is a masterpiece of his canon, as are two other works in the show, painted when poorly in Provence in 1889: Augustine Roulin (Rocking a Cradle), and Hospital at Saint-RÃ©my. Oh, and there's Starry Night (1888) and Sunflowers (1888), too. All are stunning pictures, each revealing a slightly different style and approach by the 30-something artist who had more fire in his belly than a power station's furnace. To be in the same space as these paintings is like being hard-wired into the earth's energy supply: you can feel the life force. He didn't merely paint what he saw. He painted what he felt about what he saw. And he felt a lot. Hence the expressive lines, the thick impasto oils, and vibrant colours. Van Gogh didn't so much as wear his heart on his sleeve, he wore it on the end of a fully loaded paintbrush. Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers (1888) inspired many British artists to create their own interpretations of the work He was a restless artist in every way; constantly experimenting, obsessively working, and frequently relocating (often after the demise of an intense relationship). He was a peripatetic painter, settling at first in the Netherlands, then Paris, and finally, during his last months, in the South of France. He was, as they say, all over the place. Well, nearly. Despite the title of this exhibition, he never so much as lifted a paint brush during his three-year stay in Britain. The then 20-year old Dutchman arrived one weekend in May 1873, having been sent to London by his employer, the art dealer Goupil. At this point in his life Vincent was more interested in selling art than making it (although he drew a lot). If anything, he was more inclined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a preacher. Or, failing that (which he did), a teacher (also attempted, not a success). But, unbeknownst to him, all those walks along the Thames he so loved to take with a Charles Dickens tome in his pocket and a top hat on his head (""You couldn't be seen in London without one""), were quietly informing his future artistic sensibilities. Britain was priming Van Gogh's canvas. Van Gogh loved Charles Dickens, and in L'ArlÃ©sienne (1890) he shows one of his favourite books, Christmas Stories At least, that's what this exhibition argues. And does so convincingly, comparing paintings he would later produce with those he saw in museums and galleries while living in Brixton. For instance, on one wall hangs Meindert Hobbema's The Avenue at Middleharnis (1689), a National Gallery painting that had caught Vincent's eye. While on the opposing wall hangs his own Avenue of Poplars in Autumn (1884). It's not exactly a facsimile, nor is a receding line of trees a motif previously unknown to Van Gogh, but there's enough of a similarity to suggest an influence. A more compelling case is made with Starry Night, which is presented alongside two other artworks: James Whistler's atmospheric Nocturne: Grey and Gold, Westminster Bridge (1871-2), and Gustave DorÃ©'s Evening on the Thames (1872). Vincent has clearly noted compositional elements from both images, but more than that, there is the romantic, twilight atmosphere shared by all three pictures, which pull you towards them like a cool drink on a hot night. 1. When Van Gogh was in London he would stop and look as this view painted by James Whistler on his way home, standing for a while and drawing it for pleasure. 2. Vincent bought this print of an Evening on the Thames by Gustave DorÃ© after he left Britain. The nocturnal mood it captures is evident in Van Gogh's Starry Night. 3. It is clear when seen together that Vincent was heavily influenced by both Whistler and DorÃ©. You can detect similarities across all three in terms of composition, light effects on the water,  subject, and time of day. The mood changes as you make your way through the show. Sensual evenings give way to anxious old men and prisoners in an exercise yard. The match-ups continue and with them more and more elaborate examples of how Britain was the making of Vincent van Gogh. Frankly, you could construct the same argument about his time in the Netherlands or France. At least, you could for the first half of the show, which is about how a country influenced him. But not for the second part, which focuses on how he influenced Britain. Van Gogh painted his only image of London, Prisoners Exercising 1890, from Gustave DorÃ©'s print of Newgate Prison We know that David Hockney is a big fan. So much so, in fact, that there is currently a Hockney show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. But he doesn't make the cut in the Tate's exhibition, which concentrates on earlier 20th Century British artists like Walter Sickert, Winifred Nicholson, and - most powerfully - Francis Bacon, who once said about the flame-haired painter from Zundert: ""Van Gogh speaks of the need to make changes in reality, which become lies that are truer than the literal truth."" There is a room dedicated to showing Bacon's three magnificent responses to Van Gogh's lost canvas, Painter on the Road to Tarascon (1888). They should be a wonder to behold, an exhibition highlight from which you can stand back and breathe in. But they are not. The experience of seeing them is compromised by an annoying television screen on the left-hand wall showing a clip from Vincente Minnelli's 1956 Van Gogh biopic Lust for Life. There's nothing wrong with the movie, Kirk Douglas turns in a decent Vincent, but to have its distracting flickering presence in a dark-walled gallery dedicated to three important paintings by Britain's greatest - Van Gogh-inspired - expressionist painter is a crime against art and curating. It is such an insensitive thing to do. There's plenty of space outside the gallery to put the screen. Stick it anywhere, just leave the art alone. Francis Bacon's melancholic Study for Portrait of Van Gogh IV (1957) is one of three of works by the artist responding to Van Gogh's Painter on the Road to Tarascon (1888) There is another audio-visual intervention earlier in the show - again too near a major work (Augustine Roulin, Rocking a Cradle). It is marginally less irritating but still an unwelcome presence. I thought budgets in museums were supposed to be tight and tech expensive. Get rid of it, save the money and reduce the ticket price. The more people who can see the exhibition the better: it is a cracking show boasting one superstar, an excellent supporting cast, and an ingenious narrative that could well be made into a movie - to be seen in a cinema not in an art gallery.

"Psychiatrists are being urged to ask children with mental health issues how long they spend online and what they use social media for. Questions about technology should be a routine part of assessments, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. It is concerned about how time spent online impacts on mood, sleep, diet and behaviour. The government is expected to announce plans to regulate social media companies soon. The College's advice comes as evidence grows of a possible link between harmful content or time spent online, and poor mental health. It is planning to publish a report later this year about its stance on technology use and children's mental health, which will include recommendations for parents, children and doctors. When assessing children, psychiatrists are being advised to think about: harmful content, especially material which could impact on an existing mental illness, such as self-harm photos or images which promote eating disorders how problematic technology use could be related to problems with sleep, poor academic performance, low mood and behavioural or eating difficulties how conditions such as depression or eating disorders may make children more likely to spend too long online or use technology in a way that is harmful The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that children stop using technology at least an hour before going to bed, and avoid using technology at mealtimes. This is a view echoed by the Chief Medical Officer in her recent guidance on social media. A group of MPs recently called for a tax on social media companies' profits, saying the firms are operating in ""an online wild west"" and should help fund research into the links between technology use and mental illness. The government is expected to announce plans for an independent regulator which would enforce a new statutory 'duty of care' on social media companies. This comes after growing concerns about graphic online content, including material featuring suicide and self-harm. Earlier this year, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, saidInstagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. How can governments regulate social media? Is young people's mental health getting worse? One in four young women has mental illness Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at RCPsych, said: ""Although we recognise that social media and technology are not primary drivers of mental illness in young people, we know that they are an important part of their lives and can be harmful in some situations. ""As a frontline clinician, I regularly see young people who have deliberately hurt themselves after discussing self-harm techniques online. ""Clinicians recognise the well-known phenomena of young people copying each other's harmful behaviour while on in-patient units, but it's even more worrying to see this replicated in the online world where audiences are so much bigger."" She added: ""We're also finding that some young people report being recommended harmful content; for example, links to websites encouraging weight loss or displaying self-harm after searching for, or clicking on, similar content just once before."" Dr Dubicka said it was important to consider whether social media was affecting children and young people's mental health so that the causes of their distress could be addressed. Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""Young people we work with rarely say that social media is the 'cause' of mental health conditions, but they say it can heighten problems that they are already struggling with, adding to anxiety or making them feel worse when they compare their lives to those of other people."" Claire Murdoch, national director for mental health at NHS England, said: ""Social media plays a big part in everyday life for most children and young people, but it should act as a wake-up call when leading psychiatrists say online activities now need to be considered when assessing youngsters' mental health and wellbeing."" She said the NHS planned to improve access to mental health services for young people but expected social media giants to ""step up to the plate"". Can you talk about self-harm online safely?

"This video can not be played The Masterchef 2019 winner on her show highlights. Retired banker Irini Tzortzoglou has won this year's MasterChef - and quickly said she has no plans to start a new career running a restaurant. The 61-year-old triumphed in the BBC One show's first all-female final. For the final three-course challenge, she cooked red mullet with a squid risotto, griddled rosemary lamb chops and a fig and hazelnut baklava. Irini, who took inspiration from her Greek childhood, grew up in Crete and now lives in Cartmel, Cumbria. She was one of 56 amateur chefs who competed for the coveted MasterChef trophy in the show's 15th series. Over the course of several gruelling rounds of cooking challenges, they were whittled down to the final three. Irini was particularly pleased to have been in the show's first all-female final and said she wished she could have shared her trophy with her fellow finalists Jilly McCord and Delia Maria Asser. Irini beat off competition from Delia Maria Asser (far left) and Jilly McCord She said: ""It happened so quickly that I felt all the final that the three of us were like one. ""We were all doing our own thing, but actually we were in unison - so my instinctive reaction was: 'Can I share it? Can I share it with my friends?'"" Irini continued: ""We are just lucky we are three women who love and respect each other and have grown to be very fond and appreciative of each other's talents."" Irini Tzortzoglou said she wouldn't follow past winners in opening a restaurant Irini said being filmed throughout the series did not bother her because she remained ""totally focused"". In an interview on BBC Breakfast, she said: ""The cameras didn't disturb me because you really need to ignore them if you want to cook. ""And the guys are fantastic, Gregg [Wallace] comes and relaxes you - he used to joke with me about Greek history, challenge me, laugh with me - and then John [Torode] is like a younger brother who cares for you, he wants you to do as well as you want to. ""They didn't bother me at all. In fact, I loved being around them."" Past winners of the show, such as 2005 champion Thomasina Miers and 2011's Shelina Permalloo, have gone on to own their own restaurants. But despite impressing some of the biggest names in the food industry throughout the competition, Irini's future plans do not involve opening her own professional kitchen. ""I don't think that at my time of life I want to run a restaurant,"" she said. ""I want to spend more time with my mum and I would love to go round Greece and do some research - maybe make a programme, if I'm lucky.""

"Theresa May stood out from the crowd at an informal EU leaders summit back in September EU leaders head into this weekend with a heavy heart. They know, in theory, that all Brexit options remain on the table and they haven't entirely given up hope of a negotiated UK departure, but there is little trust here that the prime minister or Parliament will manage to pull it off. Despite all the drama, the money and time spent by EU leaders on Brexit over the last two years (summits, dedicated governmental departments, no-deal planning), all the hard, hard graft put in by the EU and UK negotiating teams, Europe's leaders are asking themselves what there is to show for it all. Ongoing Brexit divisions in parliament, in government and in Theresa May's cabinet were on screaming technicolour display again last week. MPs reject May's EU withdrawal agreement Brexit: What happens next? EU leaders used to use the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic (as did the UK). They now believe it to be a very real prospect. That has led to a number of countries - notably France - questioning the logic of delaying Brexit for much longer. They wonder if the UK will ever unite around a Brexit Way Forward -  be it a softer Brexit, no deal or no Brexit. Would a Brexit extension, allowing for a general election or a second referendum, really settle the issue, they ask? Or will the EU and UK end up in a no deal scenario anyway, after countless extra months of agonising (and costly) uncertainty? France's President Macron - suffering from sagging popularity ratings at home - is hell-bent on breathing life in to the European project. He is far from excited at the idea of having a recalcitrant UK - with 8.5 toes already out of the club - overshadowing proceedings for the immediate future. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke at a EU leaders summit last week In the next few months, the EU holds decisive elections for the European parliament, where populist nationalists are predicted to make a strong showing. New European Commission and European Council presidents will need to be chosen and the next EU budget should be  decided this autumn. The French president is not alone in worrying that an in-the-process-of leaving UK could throw a spanner in the works if it so chose. This is not to say that the answer will be no if the prime minister comes to the emergency Brexit summit of EU leaders on 10 April, asking for a longer delay. But there is a lively debate right now in EU circles about the virtue of granting the UK (by law all EU countries must come to a unanimous decision) a longer Brexit delay vs no deal in April or May. Of course no deal would be costly for the EU too, but for some, it's beginning to look like the best of a bunch of bad options. No-deal Brexiteers 'peddling myths' Brexit: Stop 'chasing rainbows' say firms Treating a no-deal Brexit as a looming, very real possibility, rather than a distant, highly unlikely prospect, is making the EU take a long, hard look at its own no-deal planning. At every opportunity, in press statements and tweets, EU leaders boast that they are fully prepared- but that is not entirely true. Some countries and businesses are better prepared than others, but there are two hot potato political issues that - up until now - EU leaders have shied away from confronting. No longer. Spain is now being told to stop trying to score points - however small - over Gibraltar. Madrid's insistence on describing the Rock as a UK colony has held up finalising a document ensuring EU-wide, visa-free travel for UK citizens throughout the EU in case of no deal. UK and Spanish naval officers embraced as they handed over authority of the EU's Operation Atalanta on Friday, but relations over Gibraltar are more hostile But the EU's main no deal planning concern is the Irish border. Leaders are beginning to lean on Dublin now to finesse its plans for the border with Northern Ireland in case of a no deal Brexit. The Irish government has kept plans vague until now because the idea of border checks is politically so sensitive on the island. But Brussels believes checks and some physical infrastructure will be needed, even if it's away from the border itself. Dodds 'would remain over risking union' Germany's Angela Merkel is scheduled to fly to Dublin next week. Whatever happens with Brexit, she and other European leaders want to make sure their single market will be protected.

"MPs rejected Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement again on Friday When does determination become delusion? Number 10's answer to that may be ""not yet"". There is every chance that the prime minister will again - with routes outside the normal boundaries - try to make a version of her Brexit deal the end result of all of this. Despitea third defeat,despite the embarrassment of repeated losses, don't imagine that she is ready to say a permanent farewell to the compromise deal she brokered with the EU or, straightaway, to her time in office. There is still a belief in the heart of government that there could be a way round, perhaps to include the prime minister's agreed treaty as one of the options that is subject to a series of votes that will be put in front of the Commons next week. The aspiration, strange as it sounds, for some time now has been to prove to MPs that the deal is the least worst of all the options, for time to expose the impossibilities of the new compromises some MPs seek politically for the Tory party, and for the cost of a long delay to Brexit to be too great to allow Parliament to find a new way too. ""I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House,"" said Mrs May after the defeat Those allies the prime minister still has do believe - from the bunker - that there is still a chance to salvage something that looks like the prime minister's deal from the wreckage. Meaningful vote two and a half was another defeat - but the numbers of those against Number 10 were falling away. Time - and stubbornness  - may yet prove energetic critics wrong. Kuenssberg: Walls are closing in on Theresa May Brexit: What happens next? But is the coping strategy of ""just keep trying"" realistically enough? Ask Tory MPs and you hear a variety of ""we're stuffed"", ""she's over"", ""it's a disaster"". Labour MPs are simply not yet moving in the numbers Downing Street had long hoped for. Recent attempts to reach out have provoked more frustration than collaboration. And with the timetable for Brexit slipping away, the prime minister might soon be forced to conclude that the deal she believed in is truly gone. There may never be a moment of compromise with her at the helm. Theresa May never wanted to be only the Brexit prime minister. But the entrenched divisions she inherited, and the miscalculations that have led her to this point,  mean the eventual outcome of this chaos will not just be up to her, and will forever mark her moment in charge.

"This video can not be played Police used water cannon during the protest in Algiers Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Algeria to demand the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Estimates say crowds in the capital, Algiers, reached a million. It is the sixth successive Friday of mass anti-government protests in the country. Earlier this week an army general,Lt Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah, called for the position of president to made vacant. But opposition parties in Algeria said it would not guarantee free elections. Algerian police fired tear gas at crowds as they attempted to reach the presidency, the BBC's Mohamed Arezki Himeur, in Algiers, said. How does reclusive President Bouteflika run Algeria? Beating the president not enough for protesters The renewed calls for regime change come just days after Lt Gen Gaed Salah demanded that Mr Bouteflika be declared unfit to rule. Demonstrations against Mr Bouteflika began last month after the president, who has seldom been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, announced that he would stand for another term. In response, the president agreed to not stand for a fifth term in upcoming elections, which have been delayed. However the move did not go down well with protesters, who said his decision not to run was a cynical move to prolong his 20-year rule. Some estimates say as many as a million people marched in the capital, Algiers They are now calling for the departure of the president and also an entire generation of Algerian political leaders, including those who would be in line to succeed him. At the protest in Algiers, one member of the crowd, named as Ali, told Reuters news agency: ""We only have one word to say today, all the gang must go immediately, game over."" Lt Gen Gaed Salah - who is also deputy defence minister and seen as loyal to Mr Bouteflika - this week called for the use of Article 102, which allows the Constitutional Council to declare the position of president vacant if the leader is unfit to rule. The ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), backed the general's call. Under the constitution, the head of the Senate, Abdelkhader Bansallah, would become the acting head of state until an election could be held. Despite the significant intervention, the call from the army chief of staff does not appear to be enough for protesters and opposition parties, who have continued to protest on the streets. By Ahmed Rouaba, BBC Africa Opposition parties and protesters in Algeria were not impressed by the suggestion of Lt Gen Gaid Salah to trigger Article 102 of the constitution. The majority of protesters are youth who are not involved in party politics and who say they are not interested in the departure of Mr Bouteflika only to see the power transferred to his former allies - bringing to power different faces of the same regime. It is difficult to predict what is going to happen because there is no indication that opposition parties hold any influence over the protesters, who do not have any leader or spokesperson who could hold talks with the authorities. The army clearly wanted to see an end to the crisis when they abandoned Mr Bouteflika in an unexpected move. But they need to find an influential party to discuss the procedure with. For the moment, the protesters' expectations are very high as they demand the departure of ""everybody who has been associated with the regime"", but they do not offer an alternative. Lt Gen Gaid Salah had already dismissed the idea of ""removing everybody"" as expressed in the protests and on social media. Said Bouteflika:Many in Algeria believe the president's younger brother is the de facto ruler of the country. He is described as being the president's gatekeeper, leading the presidential clan and protecting its interests from behind the scenes. Lakhdar Brahimi:One of the country's most respected veteran diplomats, Mr Brahimi had a successful career at the highest level in the UN General Secretariat. When protests in Algeria first began, Mr Brahimi was chosen to head a transitional conference on the country's political future. Ali Benflis:The founder of the state-run Algerian League for Human Rights was appointed minister for justice in 1988. He was named prime minister in 2000 but dismissed in 2003. He is considered a possible successor despite losing presidential bids in 2004 and 2014. Ali Haddad:The former head of Algeria's Business Forum was identified by Algerian and French press as being one of the main financiers of Mr Bouteflika's 2014 re-election campaign. Ahmed Gaid Salah:The army chief of staff has created controversy by commenting on public matters, leading many to believe that he has presidential ambitions. The Lt Gen has also frequently helped Mr Bouteflika undermine the position of other generals.

"There's no point beating about the bush: if you possibly can, go and see this show at Tate Britain. The time and ticket expense (a chunky Â£22 standard price) will be worth it simply to stand in front of Shoes (1886) for a few minutes. It is Van Gogh in top form. Two battered black boots, laces asunder and soles heavy with mud, are left forlornly in the middle of the canvas with no evidence of their exhausted owner. They remind me of late Rembrandt, Vincent's fellow countryman and guiding star, who had the same knack for showing the effects of hard labour with unsentimental honesty. These are the shoes that inspired Beckett's Waiting for Godot and, as you will see in the exhibition, William Nicholson's Miss Jekyll's Gardening Boots (1920). Take your chance to look at Van Gogh's depiction of crusty weariness while you can. You can see the influence of Van Gogh's great work Shoes, 1886 (L) in William Nicholson's painting, Miss Jekyll's Gardening Boots, 1920 (R) It is a masterpiece of his canon, as are two other works in the show, painted when poorly in Provence in 1889: Augustine Roulin (Rocking a Cradle), and Hospital at Saint-RÃ©my. Oh, and there's Starry Night (1888) and Sunflowers (1888), too. All are stunning pictures, each revealing a slightly different style and approach by the 30-something artist who had more fire in his belly than a power station's furnace. To be in the same space as these paintings is like being hard-wired into the earth's energy supply: you can feel the life force. He didn't merely paint what he saw. He painted what he felt about what he saw. And he felt a lot. Hence the expressive lines, the thick impasto oils, and vibrant colours. Van Gogh didn't so much as wear his heart on his sleeve, he wore it on the end of a fully loaded paintbrush. Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers (1888) inspired many British artists to create their own interpretations of the work He was a restless artist in every way; constantly experimenting, obsessively working, and frequently relocating (often after the demise of an intense relationship). He was a peripatetic painter, settling at first in the Netherlands, then Paris, and finally, during his last months, in the South of France. He was, as they say, all over the place. Well, nearly. Despite the title of this exhibition, he never so much as lifted a paint brush during his three-year stay in Britain. The then 20-year old Dutchman arrived one weekend in May 1873, having been sent to London by his employer, the art dealer Goupil. At this point in his life Vincent was more interested in selling art than making it (although he drew a lot). If anything, he was more inclined to follow in his father's footsteps and become a preacher. Or, failing that (which he did), a teacher (also attempted, not a success). But, unbeknownst to him, all those walks along the Thames he so loved to take with a Charles Dickens tome in his pocket and a top hat on his head (""You couldn't be seen in London without one""), were quietly informing his future artistic sensibilities. Britain was priming Van Gogh's canvas. Van Gogh loved Charles Dickens, and in L'ArlÃ©sienne (1890) he shows one of his favourite books, Christmas Stories At least, that's what this exhibition argues. And does so convincingly, comparing paintings he would later produce with those he saw in museums and galleries while living in Brixton. For instance, on one wall hangs Meindert Hobbema's The Avenue at Middleharnis (1689), a National Gallery painting that had caught Vincent's eye. While on the opposing wall hangs his own Avenue of Poplars in Autumn (1884). It's not exactly a facsimile, nor is a receding line of trees a motif previously unknown to Van Gogh, but there's enough of a similarity to suggest an influence. A more compelling case is made with Starry Night, which is presented alongside two other artworks: James Whistler's atmospheric Nocturne: Grey and Gold, Westminster Bridge (1871-2), and Gustave DorÃ©'s Evening on the Thames (1872). Vincent has clearly noted compositional elements from both images, but more than that, there is the romantic, twilight atmosphere shared by all three pictures, which pull you towards them like a cool drink on a hot night. 1. When Van Gogh was in London he would stop and look as this view painted by James Whistler on his way home, standing for a while and drawing it for pleasure. 2. Vincent bought this print of an Evening on the Thames by Gustave DorÃ© after he left Britain. The nocturnal mood it captures is evident in Van Gogh's Starry Night. 3. It is clear when seen together that Vincent was heavily influenced by both Whistler and DorÃ©. You can detect similarities across all three in terms of composition, light effects on the water,  subject, and time of day. The mood changes as you make your way through the show. Sensual evenings give way to anxious old men and prisoners in an exercise yard. The match-ups continue and with them more and more elaborate examples of how Britain was the making of Vincent van Gogh. Frankly, you could construct the same argument about his time in the Netherlands or France. At least, you could for the first half of the show, which is about how a country influenced him. But not for the second part, which focuses on how he influenced Britain. Van Gogh painted his only image of London, Prisoners Exercising 1890, from Gustave DorÃ©'s print of Newgate Prison We know that David Hockney is a big fan. So much so, in fact, that there is currently a Hockney show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. But he doesn't make the cut in the Tate's exhibition, which concentrates on earlier 20th Century British artists like Walter Sickert, Winifred Nicholson, and - most powerfully - Francis Bacon, who once said about the flame-haired painter from Zundert: ""Van Gogh speaks of the need to make changes in reality, which become lies that are truer than the literal truth."" There is a room dedicated to showing Bacon's three magnificent responses to Van Gogh's lost canvas, Painter on the Road to Tarascon (1888). They should be a wonder to behold, an exhibition highlight from which you can stand back and breathe in. But they are not. The experience of seeing them is compromised by an annoying television screen on the left-hand wall showing a clip from Vincente Minnelli's 1956 Van Gogh biopic Lust for Life. There's nothing wrong with the movie, Kirk Douglas turns in a decent Vincent, but to have its distracting flickering presence in a dark-walled gallery dedicated to three important paintings by Britain's greatest - Van Gogh-inspired - expressionist painter is a crime against art and curating. It is such an insensitive thing to do. There's plenty of space outside the gallery to put the screen. Stick it anywhere, just leave the art alone. Francis Bacon's melancholic Study for Portrait of Van Gogh IV (1957) is one of three of works by the artist responding to Van Gogh's Painter on the Road to Tarascon (1888) There is another audio-visual intervention earlier in the show - again too near a major work (Augustine Roulin, Rocking a Cradle). It is marginally less irritating but still an unwelcome presence. I thought budgets in museums were supposed to be tight and tech expensive. Get rid of it, save the money and reduce the ticket price. The more people who can see the exhibition the better: it is a cracking show boasting one superstar, an excellent supporting cast, and an ingenious narrative that could well be made into a movie - to be seen in a cinema not in an art gallery.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: The rejection of the EU withdrawal agreement will have ""grave"" implications MPs have rejected Theresa Mayâs EU withdrawal agreement on the day the UK was due to leave the EU. The government lost by 344 votes to 286, a margin of 58, and means the UK has missed an EU deadline to delay Brexit to 22 May and leave with a deal. The prime minister said the UK would have to find ""an alternative way forward"", which was ""almost certain"" to involve holding European elections. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said ""this deal now has to change"" or the PM must quit. Meanwhile, thousands of Leave supportersgathered outside Parliamentto protest against the delay to Brexit, bringing traffic to a standstill. Brexit: What happens next? Long Brexit delay depends on UK - Varadkar Business 'devastated' by Brexit vote Mrs May now has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to the negotiation process to avoid a no-deal Brexit on that date. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  With a clear majority in the Commons against a no-deal Brexit, and with MPs holding more votes on alternative plans on Monday, Mrs May said that the UK would have to find ""an alternative way forward"". The prime minister said that the outcome was ""a matter of profound regret"", adding that ""I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House"". Downing Street said it was still not an ""inevitability"" that the UK would have to take part in elections to the European Parliament in May. It is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. There is little reason tonight to think that, in the end, the burning core of Euroscepticism in the Tory Party will ever accept her deal. There are few signs that any more than a handful of Labour MPs are really going to take the plunge and ultimately walk through the same lobbies as Theresa May, and Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith. The prime minister concluded today that our political process is reaching its limits. But maybe soon it will be her leadership, her deal, that has passed its limits. A No 10 source indicated that the prime minister would continue to seek support in the Commons for her deal. ""Clearly it was not the result we wanted. But, that said, we have had a number of senior Conservative colleagues who have felt able to vote with the government today. They have done so in higher numbers than previously,"" the source said. ""Clearly there is more work to do. We are at least going in the right direction."" Downing Street said Mrs May would continue to talk to the Democratic Unionist Party about more reassurances over theIrish backstop, which it says risks splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. But the DUP's leader at Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC's Newsnight political editor Nick Watt: ""I would stay in the European Union and remain, rather than risk Northern Ireland's position. That's how strongly I feel about the Union."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This deal now has to change"" Responding to the vote, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted: ""In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April."" In a statement, the European Commission said the UK would have to ""indicate a way forward"" by 12 April ""for consideration by the European Council"". ""A 'no-deal' scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since December 2017 and is now fully prepared for a 'no-deal' scenario at midnight on 12 April. The EU will remain united,"" the statement said. ""The benefits of the withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a 'no-deal' scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option."" Despite all the drama, the money and time spent by EU leaders on Brexit (summits, dedicated governmental departments, no-deal planning) and all the hard, hard graft put in by the EU and UK negotiating teams, Europe's leaders are asking themselves what there is to show for it all. Ongoing Brexit divisions in Parliament, in government and in Theresa May's cabinet were on screaming technicolour display again last week. EU leaders used to use the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic (as did the UK). They now believe it to be a very real prospect. That has led to a number of countries - notably France - questioning the logic of delaying Brexit for much longer. They wonder if the UK will ever unite around a Brexit Way Forward - be it a softer Brexit, no deal or no Brexit. Would a Brexit extension, allowing for a general election or a second referendum, really settle the issue, they ask? Read Katya's blog in full Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on various Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections This video can not be played The result is announced as MPs vote by 286 to 344 to reject the governmentâs withdrawal agreement Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The House has been clear, this deal now has to change. ""There has to be an alternative found. And if the prime minister can't accept that then she must go, not at an indeterminate date in the future but now. ""So that we can decide the future of this country through a general election."" Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Conservatives, said it was time for Mrs May to quit. ""This must be the final defeat for Theresa May's deal. It's finished. And we must move on. ""It has not passed. It will not pass. I regret to say it is time for Theresa May to follow through on her words and make way so that a new leader can deliver a withdrawal agreement which will be passed by Parliament."" Mr Baker was one of 34 Conservative rebels to vote against the agreement, along with the Democratic Unionist Party and the Labour Party. Five Labour MPs voted for the agreement. A number of high profile Tory Brexiteers, including Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith, did vote for the agreement, but it was not enough to prevent another damaging defeat for Mrs May, who had offered to stand down to persuade her critics to back the deal. This was not a third ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's EU deal, which also includes a political declaration on future relations between the UK and the EU, and which has previously been rejected by larger margins. By holding a vote on the withdrawal agreement only, the government had hoped to secure a short delay to Brexit and avoid the UK taking part in May's European elections. MPs are set to have another go at reaching a Brexit compromise in another series of votes on Monday and Wednesday next week. If one of the options receives a majority, the government could use it as a basis for negotiating changes to the political declaration.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: The rejection of the EU withdrawal agreement will have ""grave"" implications Theresa May and her cabinet are looking for ways to bring her EU withdrawal agreement back to the Commons for a fourth attempt at winning MPs' backing. The PM said the UK would need ""an alternative way forward""after her plan was defeatedby 58 votes on Friday. MPs from all parties will test support for other options during a second round of ""indicative votes"" on Monday. However, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the government did not support any of those options. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to say whether his party would offer an option to remain in the EU during these votes, but said the obvious choice was ""a good economic relationship with Europe"". The latest vote came on the day the UK was supposed to leave the European Union: 29 March. The date was postponed to allow Mrs May more time to find a Brexit solution. Dominic Grieve loses no-confidence vote Brexit: What happens next? EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Friday's defeat was the third time MPs have rejected her withdrawal agreement - the first vote was lost by 230 votes, the second by 149. The government has so far failed to win over 34 Conservative rebels, including both Remainers as well as Tory Brexiteers, who say the deal still leaves the UK too closely aligned to Europe. Northern Ireland's DUP - which has propped up Mrs May's minority government - also continues to oppose the deal. But a No 10 source indicated the prime minister would continue to seek support in the Commons and insisted efforts were ""going in the right direction"". MPs will hold another set of non-binding votes on various Brexit options in the Commons on Monday. None of MPs' eight proposed Brexit options secured a majority in the last round of""indicative votes""on 27 March, but the options which received the most votes were a customs union with the EU or a referendum on any deal. The customs union allows businesses to move goods around the EU without checks or charges. Continued membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Pro-Brexit protestors wearing yellow vests blocked roads in central London Brandon Lewis told Radio 4's Today programme: ""The government's position is very clear - we do not support these options. The government's position is we believe the best way to respect the referendum is to deliver the deal."" He said staying in a customs union with the EU would go against the result of the referendum and the Conservatives' election manifesto. However, Mr Corbyn said Labour would propose a deal that did involve a customs union with the EU - to protect the issue of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. He said: ""I'm convinced at that after spending a lot of time meeting with and talking to officials in Europe."" Nicky Morgan, a former cabinet minister and Tory MP, said one way to end the Brexit deadlock could be a government of national unity - which is a cabinet made up of different parties. She told Today: ""There have been periods in our history when we have had national unity governments or a coalition for a very specific issue."" There is every chance that the prime minister will again - with routes outside the normal boundaries - try to make a version of her Brexit deal the end result of all of this. Despitea third defeat,despite the embarrassment of repeated losses, don't imagine that she is ready to say a permanent farewell to the compromise deal she brokered with the EU or, straightaway, to her time in office. There is still a belief in the heart of government that there could be a way round, perhaps to include the prime minister's agreed treaty as one of the options that is subject to a series of votes that will be put in front of the Commons next week. The aspiration, strange as it sounds, for some time now has been to prove to MPs that the deal is the least worst of all the options... Read Laura's thoughts in full Earlier this month, EU leaders gave the PM until 12 April to come up with a Brexit solution; if her deal had made it through Parliament on Friday that date would have been pushed back to 22 May to allow time to pass the necessary legislation. Since the deal was rejected, Mrs May now has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said she remained ""confident"" the government could deliver Brexit, adding that ""we have to keep trying"". Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said leaving the EU without a deal was the best option on the table. ""No deal is the only way we're going to get out, fulfilling our manifesto pledges and the commitment we made to the British people after the referendum,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This deal now has to change"" Mrs May said it was ""almost certain"" there would have to be an extended delay to Brexit to allow the UK to take part in the European elections at the end of May if her deal does not go through. But Downing Street later said this was not an ""inevitability"". The withdrawal agreement is the part of the Brexit deal Mrs May struck with Brussels which sets out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and the Irish backstop arrangements. If Mrs May wants to hold another vote on the deal in Parliament, it has to comply withCommons Speaker John Bercow's rulingthat it can only be brought back with ""substantial"" changes. This is why the government separated the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration - on the future relationship with the EU - for Friday's vote.

Thousandsgathered outside Parliamentto protest against the delay, bringing traffic to a standstill. Meanwhile Conservative former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has campaigned for a further referendum on the deal, is facing deselection afterlosing a vote of no-confidence in his Beaconsfield constituency. The prominent Remainer, who remains an MP for the time being, clashed with his local Conservative Party over Brexit.

The PM said the UK would need ""an alternative way forward""after her plan was defeatedby 58 votes on Friday. MPs from all parties will test support for other options during a second round of ""indicative votes"" on Monday. However, Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the government did not support any of those options. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to say whether his party would offer an option to remain in the EU during these votes, but said the obvious choice was ""a good economic relationship with Europe"". The latest vote came on the day the UK was supposed to leave the European Union: 29 March. The date was postponed to allow Mrs May more time to find a Brexit solution. Dominic Grieve loses no-confidence vote Brexit: What happens next? EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Friday's defeat was the third time MPs have rejected her withdrawal agreement - the first vote was lost by 230 votes, the second by 149. The government has so far failed to win over 34 Conservative rebels, including both Remainers as well as Tory Brexiteers, who say the deal still leaves the UK too closely aligned to Europe. Northern Ireland's DUP - which has propped up Mrs May's minority government - also continues to oppose the deal. But a No 10 source indicated the prime minister would continue to seek support in the Commons and insisted efforts were ""going in the right direction"". MPs will hold another set of non-binding votes on various Brexit options in the Commons on Monday. None of MPs' eight proposed Brexit options secured a majority in the last round of""indicative votes""on 27 March, but the options which received the most votes were a customs union with the EU or a referendum on any deal. The customs union allows businesses to move goods around the EU without checks or charges. Continued membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Pro-Brexit protestors wearing yellow vests blocked roads in central London Brandon Lewis told Radio 4's Today programme: ""The government's position is very clear - we do not support these options. The government's position is we believe the best way to respect the referendum is to deliver the deal."" He said staying in a customs union with the EU would go against the result of the referendum and the Conservatives' election manifesto. However, Mr Corbyn said Labour would propose a deal that did involve a customs union with the EU - to protect the issue of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. He said: ""I'm convinced at that after spending a lot of time meeting with and talking to officials in Europe."" Nicky Morgan, a former cabinet minister and Tory MP, said one way to end the Brexit deadlock could be a government of national unity - which is a cabinet made up of different parties. She told Today: ""There have been periods in our history when we have had national unity governments or a coalition for a very specific issue."" There is every chance that the prime minister will again - with routes outside the normal boundaries - try to make a version of her Brexit deal the end result of all of this. Despitea third defeat,despite the embarrassment of repeated losses, don't imagine that she is ready to say a permanent farewell to the compromise deal she brokered with the EU or, straightaway, to her time in office. There is still a belief in the heart of government that there could be a way round, perhaps to include the prime minister's agreed treaty as one of the options that is subject to a series of votes that will be put in front of the Commons next week. The aspiration, strange as it sounds, for some time now has been to prove to MPs that the deal is the least worst of all the options... Read Laura's thoughts in full Earlier this month, EU leaders gave the PM until 12 April to come up with a Brexit solution; if her deal had made it through Parliament on Friday that date would have been pushed back to 22 May to allow time to pass the necessary legislation. Since the deal was rejected, Mrs May now has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said she remained ""confident"" the government could deliver Brexit, adding that ""we have to keep trying"". Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said leaving the EU without a deal was the best option on the table. ""No deal is the only way we're going to get out, fulfilling our manifesto pledges and the commitment we made to the British people after the referendum,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This deal now has to change"" Mrs May said it was ""almost certain"" there would have to be an extended delay to Brexit to allow the UK to take part in the European elections at the end of May if her deal does not go through. But Downing Street later said this was not an ""inevitability"". The withdrawal agreement is the part of the Brexit deal Mrs May struck with Brussels which sets out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and the Irish backstop arrangements. If Mrs May wants to hold another vote on the deal in Parliament, it has to comply withCommons Speaker John Bercow's rulingthat it can only be brought back with ""substantial"" changes. This is why the government separated the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration - on the future relationship with the EU - for Friday's vote. Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on various Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections Meanwhile, Leave voters registered their anger at the latest vote rejection with a protest at Westminster. Thousandsgathered outside Parliamentto protest against the delay, bringing traffic to a standstill. Meanwhile Conservative former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has campaigned for a further referendum on the deal, is facing deselection afterlosing a vote of no-confidence in his Beaconsfield constituency. The prominent Remainer, who remains an MP for the time being, clashed with his local Conservative Party over Brexit. Despite all the drama, the money and time spent by EU leaders on Brexit (summits, dedicated governmental departments, no-deal planning) and all the hard, hard graft put in by the EU and UK negotiating teams, Europe's leaders are asking themselves what there is to show for it all. Ongoing Brexit divisions in Parliament, in government and in Theresa May's cabinet were on screaming technicolour display again last week. EU leaders used to use the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic (as did the UK). They now believe it to be a very real prospect. That has led to a number of countries - notably France - questioning the logic of delaying Brexit for much longer. They wonder if the UK will ever unite around a Brexit Way Forward - be it a softer Brexit, no deal or no Brexit. Would a Brexit extension, allowing for a general election or a second referendum, really settle the issue, they ask?

"Theresa May stood out from the crowd at an informal EU leaders summit back in September EU leaders head into this weekend with a heavy heart. They know, in theory, that all Brexit options remain on the table and they haven't entirely given up hope of a negotiated UK departure, but there is little trust here that the prime minister or Parliament will manage to pull it off. Despite all the drama, the money and time spent by EU leaders on Brexit over the last two years (summits, dedicated governmental departments, no-deal planning), all the hard, hard graft put in by the EU and UK negotiating teams, Europe's leaders are asking themselves what there is to show for it all. Ongoing Brexit divisions in parliament, in government and in Theresa May's cabinet were on screaming technicolour display again last week. MPs reject May's EU withdrawal agreement Brexit: What happens next? EU leaders used to use the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic (as did the UK). They now believe it to be a very real prospect. That has led to a number of countries - notably France - questioning the logic of delaying Brexit for much longer. They wonder if the UK will ever unite around a Brexit Way Forward -  be it a softer Brexit, no deal or no Brexit. Would a Brexit extension, allowing for a general election or a second referendum, really settle the issue, they ask? Or will the EU and UK end up in a no deal scenario anyway, after countless extra months of agonising (and costly) uncertainty? France's President Macron - suffering from sagging popularity ratings at home - is hell-bent on breathing life in to the European project. He is far from excited at the idea of having a recalcitrant UK - with 8.5 toes already out of the club - overshadowing proceedings for the immediate future. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke at a EU leaders summit last week In the next few months, the EU holds decisive elections for the European parliament, where populist nationalists are predicted to make a strong showing. New European Commission and European Council presidents will need to be chosen and the next EU budget should be  decided this autumn. The French president is not alone in worrying that an in-the-process-of leaving UK could throw a spanner in the works if it so chose. This is not to say that the answer will be no if the prime minister comes to the emergency Brexit summit of EU leaders on 10 April, asking for a longer delay. But there is a lively debate right now in EU circles about the virtue of granting the UK (by law all EU countries must come to a unanimous decision) a longer Brexit delay vs no deal in April or May. Of course no deal would be costly for the EU too, but for some, it's beginning to look like the best of a bunch of bad options. No-deal Brexiteers 'peddling myths' Brexit: Stop 'chasing rainbows' say firms Treating a no-deal Brexit as a looming, very real possibility, rather than a distant, highly unlikely prospect, is making the EU take a long, hard look at its own no-deal planning. At every opportunity, in press statements and tweets, EU leaders boast that they are fully prepared- but that is not entirely true. Some countries and businesses are better prepared than others, but there are two hot potato political issues that - up until now - EU leaders have shied away from confronting. No longer. Spain is now being told to stop trying to score points - however small - over Gibraltar. Madrid's insistence on describing the Rock as a UK colony has held up finalising a document ensuring EU-wide, visa-free travel for UK citizens throughout the EU in case of no deal. UK and Spanish naval officers embraced as they handed over authority of the EU's Operation Atalanta on Friday, but relations over Gibraltar are more hostile But the EU's main no deal planning concern is the Irish border. Leaders are beginning to lean on Dublin now to finesse its plans for the border with Northern Ireland in case of a no deal Brexit. The Irish government has kept plans vague until now because the idea of border checks is politically so sensitive on the island. But Brussels believes checks and some physical infrastructure will be needed, even if it's away from the border itself. Dodds 'would remain over risking union' Germany's Angela Merkel is scheduled to fly to Dublin next week. Whatever happens with Brexit, she and other European leaders want to make sure their single market will be protected.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

"The gang were arrested following a year-long police investigation Eight members of a family-run drugs gang who supplied up to Â£2.5m worth of cocaine have been jailed. They distributed about 42kg of cocaine in Newport between July 2016 and June 2018, the city's crown court heard. The judge said each of them played a role ""trading in a vile drug"". Half of the gang, led by brothers Jerome and Blaine Nunes, were jailed on Friday. Eight others, including the pair's mother Angela Collingbourne, 51, will be sentenced at a later date. They were arrested following a year-long police investigation which involved surveillance and secret recordings. Judge Daniel Williams described it as ""painstaking, impressive and thorough"". 'No quick solutions' to drugs problems Can theatre help tackle county lines? Initially, the gang operated out of a garage called NP19 tyres which prosecution barrister Andrew Jones described as a ""front to launder money from drug dealing"". Video recording showed thousands of pounds passing through the premises while only a handful of cars were being repaired. Central to the organisation was a mobile phone called ""the Jez line"" which was the main point of contact for customers. Half of the drugs gang were sentenced at Newport Crown Court on Friday with the remainder to be done at a later date On average, 267 contacts were made with the phone line each day, with more than 4,000 different numbers contacted over a two-year period. The Nunes brothers were convicted of conspiracy to supply a class A drug between 31 July 2016 and 15 June 2018 following a trial. Six other defendants pleaded guilty to the same charge. The judge said it was one of the most ""depressing features"" of the case that Jerome Nunes was able to direct the operation from his prison cell using hidden mobile phones. He was already serving a seven year, eight month sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to supply. He will now serve an additional 12 years. Blaine Nunes was sentenced to 14 years, to run consecutively with a sentence of four years and eight months he is already serving forcausing death by dangerous driving. The other members of the gang to be jailed on Friday were: Preston Killoran, 25, eight years, eight months Thomas Allison, 26, 10 years Kieran Vodden, 23, seven years, four months Ashley Lloyd, 23, six years Joel Clark, 23, six years each Daniel Richardson, 34, five years The convictions come after 120 officers from Gwent Police and Tarian, the regional organised crime unit for south Wales, conducted a series of raids in Maindee and Alway in Newport. Det Ch Insp Julian Bull said: ""It is good to know that these criminals are now behind bars and unable to continue profiting from the misery their trade brings to our neighbourhoods.""

"This video can not be played Leave supporters have gathered outside Parliament Thousands of Leave supporters have protested at Westminster against the delay to Brexit, on the day the UK had been due to leave the EU. Some demonstrators reacted with cheers, while others shouted ""shame on you"", asMPs rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. The March to Leave - which began in Sunderland two weeks ago - arrived in Parliament Square on Friday afternoon. A separate Make Brexit Happen rally, organised by UKIP, was also held. The rally was backed by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, who spoke to crowds, along with UKIP leader Gerard Batten. Meanwhile, at the March to Leave protest, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Tory Brexiteer MP Mark Francois delivered speeches. Campaign group Stand Up to Racism also held a counter-protest in Westminster, saying it was there ""against the far right who are trying to capitalise on the Brexit crisis"". The protests in Westminster continued into the evening Many of the supporters carried Union Jack flags or placards Pro-Brexit supporters burn an EU flag near to Trafalgar Square Some Brexit protesters continued to demonstrate into the evening, and lines of police were deployed to keep the crowds under control. The Metropolitan Police said five arrests had been made at the demonstrations - although that included one man who was wanted in connection with an offence elsewhere. Two other people were arrested on suspicion of assault, another on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and someone else on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. It comes as MPs on Fridayrejected Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal deal, which she negotiated with the EU, by 58 votes. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but both sides agreed to postpone the date last week after Mrs May had twice been unable to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. Brexit: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Friday's defeat of the withdrawal agreement led to mixed reactions. Some in the crowd, who saw Mrs May's deal as too soft, welcomed its rejection, while others feared it could lead to another EU referendum. Two separate pro-Brexit demonstrations ended in Parliament Square on Friday Protesters release balloons in Parliament Square Police lined up outside the House of Commons in Parliament Square Former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage spoke at the March to Leave rally - organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave - and was greeted by loud cheers as he took to the stage. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum, and those who voted for it, with total and utter contempt for the past three years."" Among those on the March to Leave through London were sisters Beatrice and Alice Grant The 270-mile, 14-day march ended at Parliament, after the last leg from Fulham Mr Farage told Leave supporters ""not to be disheartened"", and also signalled that he would be willing to stand again as an MEP if the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections in May. The UK has a new Brexit deadline of 12 April, by which point it needs to have told the EU what its next steps are. If the UK wants to delay Brexit further, the EU is expected to insist that it takes part in the elections. A crowd gathered around the stage for a speech by MEP and Brexiteer Nigel Farage Mr Farage said he believed Leave would win in another referendum ""by a bigger margin than last time"" By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, in Parliament Square The mood and atmosphere in Parliament Square is very strange for a demonstration. There is a really significant police presence, yet a lot of quiet but angry, angry people who believe that Parliament has ""betrayed"" Brexit. When the news came through that MPs had, yet again, refused to back the PM's draft deal, the reaction was rather muted. George, from St Albans, told me he was satisfied, because he hoped the UK could now crash out without a deal, as the public demanded. One man has a coffin as a prop, declaring the death of democracy. ""Bring out your dead,"" goes the prop's recording. UKIP leader Gerard Batten told the crowd at the Make Brexit Happen protest: ""As of now we do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - also took to the stage, addressing the confusion over the latest defeat of the deal: ""So Theresa May has lost her vote. Many people will be asking what does that even mean. ""It means we were betrayed. Today is supposed to be our Independence Day."" Tommy Robinson spoke during the Make Brexit Happen demo on Friday afternoon The BBC's Sarah Walton, who was also at the scene, said there were some pro-Remain campaign groups demonstrating in central London. ""But at the moment here, the majority are pro-Brexit supporters,"" she said, ""some of whom have been telling me that they were always planning on coming to London today, 29 March, but for a celebration to celebrate the day the UK would leave the EU."" ""People have been saying they have come here from all across the country. They are angry and frustrated. Some of the rally groups have said they plan to be here well into the evening."" Many protesters held flags - including both the Union Jack and England flag Other protesters donned Union Jack-themed wigs Some of the protesters wore hi-vis yellow vests, like those worn by the ""gilets jaunes"" anti-government rioters in Paris. Former black cab driver Colin Grostate, who was at the demonstration, said they were a ""symbol from France"", adding: ""We support the populism. ""Our politicians are not listening. Too many people are trying to stop what people voted for."" The Metropolitan Police said it had ""appropriate policing plans"" in place.
