"A study of dog DNA has shown that our ""best friend"" in the animal world may also be our oldest one. The analysis reveals that dog domestication can be traced back 11,000 years, to the end of the last Ice Age. This confirms that dogs were domesticated before any other known species. Our canine companions were widespread across the northern hemisphere at this time, and had already split into five different types. Despite the expansion of European dogs during the colonial era, traces of these ancient indigenous breeds survive today in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The research fills in some of the gaps in the natural history of our close animal companions. Dr Pontus Skoglund, co-author of the study and group leader of the Ancient Genomics laboratory at London's Crick Institute, told BBC News: ""Dogs are really unique in being this quite strange thing if you think about it, when all people were still hunter gatherers, they domesticate what is really a wild carnivore - wolves are pretty frightening in many parts of the world. ""The question of why did people do that? How did that come about? That's what we're ultimately interested in."" DNA clue to how dogs became our friends DNA study sheds light on dog size,external 'Walkies' through dog genome,external Dog genome boosts cancer research,external To some extent, dog genetic patterns mirror human ones, because people took their animal companions with them when they moved. But there were also important differences. The Rhodesian Ridgeback retains ancestry from an ancient African dog lineage For example, early European dogs were initially diverse, appearing to originate from two very distinct populations, one related to Near Eastern dogs and another to Siberian dogs. But at some point, perhaps after the onset of the Bronze Age, a single dog lineage spread widely and replaced all other dog populations on the continent. This pattern has no counterpart in the genetic patterns of people from Europe. Anders BergstrÃ¶m, lead author and post-doctoral researcher at the Crick, said: ""If we look back more than four or five thousand years ago, we can see that Europe was a very diverse place when it came to dogs. Although the European dogs we see today come in such an extraordinary array of shapes and forms, genetically they derive from only a very narrow subset of the diversity that used to exist."" An international team analysed the whole genomes (the full complement of DNA in the nuclei of biological cells) of 27 ancient dog remains associated with a variety of archaeological cultures. They compared these to each other and to modern dogs. The results reveal that breeds like the Rhodesian Ridgeback in southern Africa and the Chihuahua and Xoloitzcuintli in Mexico retain genetic traces of ancient indigenous dogs from the region. The New Guinea singing dog is one representative of a lineage found in dogs across Asia and Oceania The ancestry of dogs in East Asia is complex. Chinese breeds seem to derive some of their ancestry from animals like the Australian dingo and New Guinea singing dog, with the rest coming from Europe and dogs from the Russian steppe. The New Guinea singing dog is so named because of its melodious howl, characterised by a sharp increase in pitch at the start. Greger Larson, a co-author from the University of Oxford, said: ""Dogs are our oldest and closest animal partner. Using DNA from ancient dogs is showing us just how far back our shared history goes and will ultimately help us understand when and where this deep relationship began."" Dogs are thought to have evolved from wolves that ventured into human camps, perhaps sniffing around for food. As they were tamed, they could then have served humans as hunting companions or guards. The results suggest all dogs derive from a single extinct wolf population - or perhaps a few very closely related ones. If there were multiple domestication events around the world, these other lineages did not contribute much DNA to later dogs. Dr Skoglund said it was unclear when or where the initial domestication occurred. ""Dog history has been so dynamic that you can't really count on it still being there to readily read in their DNA. We really don't know - that's the fascinating thing about it."" Many animals, such as cats, probably became our pets when humans settled down to farm a little over 6,000 years ago. Cats were probably useful for controlling pests such as mice, that were attracted by the waste generated by dense settlements. This places their domestication in cradles of agriculture such as the Near East. ""For dogs, it could almost have been anywhere: cold Siberia, the warm Near East, South-East Asia. All of these are possibilities in my mind,"" Pontus Skoglund explained.

"Business is booming for America's tech giants. Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google reported sales and profits figures on Thursday covering the three months to 30 September - and there was a common thread: growth shows no sign of slowing. The cardboard boxes and delivery trucks were an early sign - and now we've got more proof: Amazon continues to be one of the biggest winners from the pandemic. Sales at the internet giant shot to $96.1bn in the three months to 30 September - up 37% from the same period in 2019. And profits hit a record $6.3bn, nearly three times last year's total. The rise was driven by its e-commerce business in North America, as families increasingly turned to online shopping. But the company's advertising and cloud computing business also saw significant gains. The growth has not come without cost. Amazon said it had $2.5bn in Covid-related expenses and its reputation has also taken a hit, with protests against the firm's working conditions and other policies. Facebook, owner of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported a whopping 2.5 billion daily users on average in September across its platforms. That's up 15% from September a year ago - but only a 3% rise from June, when people stuck-at-home turned to social media, generating a flood of activity. The company warned that the number of Facebook users even declined in the US and Canada - its most profitable market - and told investors they expected the trend to continue. Twitter reported a similar story, claiming 187 million daily active users in the July-September quarter, up just 1 million from the prior period. Amid the shutdowns earlier this year, many businesses cut advertising spending. The move led sales to slow at Facebook and pushed Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to its first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue since becoming a publicly-listed company in 2004. But spending from those businesses has returned. At Google, revenue was up 14% year-on-year - far better than analysts had expected. The rise helped profits jump an eye-popping 59% year-on-year to more than $11bn, sending the firm's shares up more than 6% in after-hours trading. Twitter also saw revenue rise 14%, while at Facebook it jumped 22% and the firm said it expected that growth to accelerate. Apple sales hit $64.7bn, up slightly from a year ago - handily beating most analyst expectations, as sales of laptops and iPads surged. But shares in the firm sank in after-hours trading anyway, as investors digested a more than 20% drop in iPhone revenue. The hit was especially evident in Apple's Greater China region - where it typically generates about 20% of its sales and sales dropped almost 30%. Apple expressed confidence that buyers were simply holding out for its latest phone, which went on sale later than in prior years. ""Despite the ongoing impacts of Covid-19, Apple is in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever, and the early response to all our new products, led by our first 5G-enabled iPhone line-up, has been tremendously positive,"" chief executive Tim Cook said. As is typical, discussions from the companies focused on sales and profits - and not the controversies swirling around them as calls for tougher regulation gain traction in the US and elsewhere. In its prepared comments, Facebook stood out with its brief nod to the issue, warning of ""headwindsâ¦ from the evolving regulatory landscape"". But the companies' financial success will only make them more of a target for complaints, warned Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight.

"This video can not be played Delia Smith calls for fans' return to stadiums Celebrity chef Delia Smith has written to the prime minister urging him to allow football fans back into stadiums. The Norwich City director warned that smaller clubs could be at risk of closure unless supporters were able to watch live games again soon. In an open letter, she said having distanced spectators was a ""far better option than six round a table inside"". The government has set up a taskforce to look at how fans might return to stadiums. Plans to reopen higher-level football grounds to supporters were postponed by the government in September amid rising Covid-19 cases. Delia is asking Boris Johnson to make a speedy decision on an agreed number of fans to be allowed into grounds to watch games. She proposes temperature checks before entry, seating people two metres apart, hand sanitising and the wearing of masks. The celebrity chef and Norwich City director believes smaller clubs are at risk of closure Her letter,published on Norwich City's website,external, said: ""Looking ahead to the possibility and consequences of smaller clubs ceasing to exist, we need to remind ourselves that football is one of the last bastions of what it means to be a community in contemporary life. ""Clubs at the heart of communities are saving the government and the taxpayer some of the high costs of youth crime. PS: Let me know if ever you want tickets to a game."" It is not the first time Delia has made a fan-related plea: in 2005, she famously took to the Carrow Road turf at half-time to urge Canaries supporters to turn up the volume, during what was a trying Premier League campaign. ""A message to the best supporters in the world,"" she said. ""We need a 12th man here. Where are you? Where are you? Let's be having you! Come on!"" Delia Smith is joint majority shareholder at Norwich City Several clubs, including Norwich, have allowed a limited number of supporters towatch matches on TV screens in the hospitality areasof their grounds. Social-distancing guidelines for hospitality venues, relevant to what tier they are in, must be observed and fans are blocked from having a direct view of the pitch. Vue cinemas have also been screening Premier League matches, including the recent Merseyside derby. David Ross, chairman of the taskforce set up by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ""We know how crucial sport is to the social fabric of our communities, as well as the local businesses who rely on it.

"Garratt Road was closed off while forensic officers searched the scene A 15-year-old boy has been killed in a double stabbing outside a branch of Sainsbury's. Patrolling Met Police officers came across a fight outside the supermarket in Wandsworth, south-west London, just before 17:00 GMT on Thursday. Another 15-year-old boy was taken to hospital with injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening. A 17-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of affray and a 19-year-old on suspicion of causing GBH. Det Ch Insp Vicky Tunstall said: ""This was a busy area, very near to the shopping centre. ""There will be people who saw or heard something suspicious that could help us to piece together the final moments for the victim and possibly identify who was responsible. ""It is these people we urgently need to speak to."" London homicides reach 100 for sixth year running The city curing violence like a disease Detectives said the stabbing on Garratt Lane was not being treated as terror-related and officers are confident they know who the victim is. His next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination will be held. Wandsworth was subject to a stop and search order following the stabbings Det Supt Owain Richards described the stabbings as ""shocking"". ""I know that the detectives on this case will be working tirelessly to understand what led up to this tragic incident and ultimately to bring the person or people responsible to justice,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Police gunshots heard as three killed in Nice 'Islamist terrorist' stabbings A Tunisian man who killed three people in a church in France only recently arrived in Europe, officials say. The suspect, 21, had an Italian Red Cross document, issued after he arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa by migrant boat last month. He was shot by police and is in a critical condition. One of the victims was ""virtually beheaded"", said the French chief anti-terrorism prosecutor. President Emmanuel Macron said it was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". Mr Macron said the number of soldiers being deployed to protect public places - such as churches and schools - would rise from 3,000 to 7,000. Anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation, and France has raised its national security alert to the highest level. In another development, a 47-year-old man believed to have been in contact with the attacker was detained by police late on Thursday, French media reported. In pictures: Scene of knife attack What we know about attack Thursday's stabbings at a church in the southern city of Nice have echoes ofanother attack earlier this month near a school north-west of Paris.Samuel Paty, a teacher, was beheaded days after showing controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to some of his pupils. That murder has heightened tensions in France. President Macron's defence of the right to publish the cartoons and the government's attempts to crack down on radical Islam have angered Turkey and other Muslim-majority countries. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron says France 'will never give in' The suspect in the attack in Nice was heard repeatedly shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) before being shot by police. A Koran, two telephones and a 30cm (12-inch) knife were found on the attacker, said chief anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard. ""We also found a bag left by the attacker. Next to this bag were two knives that were not used in the attack,"" he added. Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France France targets radical Islam amid row with Turkey Police sources named the attacker as Brahim Aouissaoui. Speaking after visiting Nice, Mr Macron said: ""If we are attacked once again it is for the values which are ours: freedom, for the possibility on our soil to believe freely and not to give in to any spirit of terror. ""I say it with great clarity once again today: we won't surrender anything."" All three were attacked inside the basilica on Thursday morning before the first Mass of the day. Two died inside the church, one of them a 60-year-old woman who was ""virtually beheaded"" close to the font. She has not been named. French media have named one victim as 55-year-old Vincent LoquÃ¨s, a devout Catholic who had reportedly worked at the basilica for more than 10 years. Mr LoquÃ¨s, a father of two loved by many of the church's regulars, was opening the building when the attacker slit his throat, police say. Allow Twitter content?

The third victim was named by Brazilian media as Simone Barreto Silva, a 44-year-old mother of three born in Salvador on Brazil's north-eastern coast. She had lived in France for 30 years. She fled to a nearby cafe with multiple stab wounds but died shortly afterwards. ""Tell my children that I love them,"" she told those who tried to help her, according to French media. The suspect was detained minutes after the attack at the basilica It later emerged that a witness had managed to raise the alarm with a special protection system set up by the city. Four police officers arrived at the scene at 08:57 local time (07:57 GMT) and the attacker was shot and detained shortly afterwards, the anti-terrorist prosecutor said. Two other attacks took place on Thursday, one in France and one in Saudi Arabia. A man was shot dead in Montfavet near the southern French city of Avignon after threatening police with a handgun. A guard was attacked outside the French consulate in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. A suspect was arrested and the guard taken to hospital. Four years ago Nice was the scene of one of France's worst jihadist attacks, when aTunisian drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Dayon 14 July, killing 86 people. Governments around the world have condemned Thursday's attack, including France's European neighbours, the US, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar and Lebanon. The terrorist threat level in France is as high now as it was in 2015-16, the terrible days of Charlie Hebdo, Bataclan, the Nice lorry-killer and the murder of Father Hamel in his church in Rouen. Things were bad enough then - and many more people died in those attacks. So why does this outbreak of Islamist violence feel somehow more scary? One reason must be the symbolism of the Samuel Paty beheading. That a simple history teacher could be murdered - and not randomly but actually selected for murder - has been deeply unsettling for French people. Likewise the targeting today of Christian worshippers in Nice. But it is also the context: the instant logic of action-response that followed President Macron's robust defence of secularism at Samuel Paty's memorial 10 days ago. All it took was a speech, then there were the threats, then there were the deaths. With a new Covid lockdown providing an eerie backdrop to these events, small wonder the French are feeling disoriented and frightened.

Dr Pontus Skoglund, co-author of the study and group leader of the Ancient Genomics laboratory at London's Crick Institute, told BBC News: ""Dogs are really unique in being this quite strange thing if you think about it, when all people were still hunter gatherers, they domesticate what is really a wild carnivore - wolves are pretty frightening in many parts of the world. ""The question of why did people do that? How did that come about? That's what we're ultimately interested in."" DNA clue to how dogs became our friends DNA study sheds light on dog size,external 'Walkies' through dog genome,external Dog genome boosts cancer research,external To some extent, dog genetic patterns mirror human ones, because people took their animal companions with them when they moved. But there were also important differences. The Rhodesian Ridgeback retains ancestry from an ancient African dog lineage For example, early European dogs were initially diverse, appearing to originate from two very distinct populations, one related to Near Eastern dogs and another to Siberian dogs. But at some point, perhaps after the onset of the Bronze Age, a single dog lineage spread widely and replaced all other dog populations on the continent. This pattern has no counterpart in the genetic patterns of people from Europe. Anders BergstrÃ¶m, lead author and post-doctoral researcher at the Crick, said: ""If we look back more than four or five thousand years ago, we can see that Europe was a very diverse place when it came to dogs. Although the European dogs we see today come in such an extraordinary array of shapes and forms, genetically they derive from only a very narrow subset of the diversity that used to exist."" An international team analysed the whole genomes (the full complement of DNA in the nuclei of biological cells) of 27 ancient dog remains associated with a variety of archaeological cultures. They compared these to each other and to modern dogs. The results reveal that breeds like the Rhodesian Ridgeback in southern Africa and the Chihuahua and Xoloitzcuintli in Mexico retain genetic traces of ancient indigenous dogs from the region. The New Guinea singing dog is one representative of a lineage found in dogs across Asia and Oceania The ancestry of dogs in East Asia is complex. Chinese breeds seem to derive some of their ancestry from animals like the Australian dingo and New Guinea singing dog, with the rest coming from Europe and dogs from the Russian steppe. The New Guinea singing dog is so named because of its melodious howl, characterised by a sharp increase in pitch at the start. Greger Larson, a co-author from the University of Oxford, said: ""Dogs are our oldest and closest animal partner. Using DNA from ancient dogs is showing us just how far back our shared history goes and will ultimately help us understand when and where this deep relationship began."" Dogs are thought to have evolved from wolves that ventured into human camps, perhaps sniffing around for food. As they were tamed, they could then have served humans as hunting companions or guards. The results suggest all dogs derive from a single extinct wolf population - or perhaps a few very closely related ones. If there were multiple domestication events around the world, these other lineages did not contribute much DNA to later dogs. Dr Skoglund said it was unclear when or where the initial domestication occurred. ""Dog history has been so dynamic that you can't really count on it still being there to readily read in their DNA. We really don't know - that's the fascinating thing about it."" Many animals, such as cats, probably became our pets when humans settled down to farm a little over 6,000 years ago. Cats were probably useful for controlling pests such as mice, that were attracted by the waste generated by dense settlements. This places their domestication in cradles of agriculture such as the Near East. ""For dogs, it could almost have been anywhere: cold Siberia, the warm Near East, South-East Asia. All of these are possibilities in my mind,"" Pontus Skoglund explained.

"This video can not be played Dijon Joseph was handcuffed and forcibly searched after police saw him fist bump his brother Liam Two innocent brothers wrongly suspected of drug dealing after being seen ""fist bumping"" have begun legal proceedings against the Metropolitan Police. Liam and Dijon Joseph were detained by officers in Deptford, south-east London, who suspected they had exchanged drugs while touching fists. A video of the incident was shared widely on social media. The brothers, who are black, say they believe they were targeted because of the colour of their skin. Lawyers for the pair say they have sued the Met for discrimination, assault and false imprisonment. Previously, thebrothers told the BBC that one officer restrained Liam, while a second rifled his pockets and - despite finding nothing illegal - took his keys and searched his car. Dijon said: ""It just seemed like a typical case of profiling. ""I felt demonised, I felt penalised, I felt criminalised. It's not just our own perceptions, it's the perception of our community."" On Tuesday theIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) published 11 recommendations from a review into stop-and-searches in London- all of which were accepted by the Met. The brother's lawyer Carolynn Gallwey said the IOPC had been investigating the motives of the officers who stopped them but found there was ""not enough evidence to say it was discrimination"". A statement added: ""After the IOPC complaint failed we approached the Equality & Human Rights Commission for help in bringing a case - they refused. ""We asked the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [Dame Cressida Dick] to admit discrimination under the Equality Act and they too refused. ""Having exhausted all other options we have today started civil proceedings at court against the Metropolitan Police for  discrimination, assault and false imprisonment. ""It remains our hope in doing so that the police and all the systems surrounding them will learn from our experience; change is past due.""

"This video can not be played JJ Williams: One of the most talented sportsmen Wales has produced Legendary Wales, British and Irish Lions and Llanelli wing JJ Williams has died at the age of 72. He scored 12 tries in 30 Tests as Wales won four Five Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, during the 1970s. A former sprinter who represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games, Williams also scored five tries in seven Tests for the Lions across two tours. He sparkled on their unbeaten tour of South Africa in 1974, scoring two tries in each of the second and third Tests. Obituary: JJ Williams Huge success with Wales followed, as Williams helped his country win the Five Nations Championship four times between 1975 and 1979. That included Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978 as Williams and his team-mates rubber-stamped their status as greats of not only Welsh rugby but the sport at large. After retiring, Williams made a name for himself as an outspoken pundit, co-commentating on international and club rugby for BBC Wales. Allow Twitter content?

Wales players will wear black armbands for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland. Wales head coach Wayne Pivac said: ""On behalf of the national squad, management and team, our thoughts and condolences go out to JJ's family and friends. ""It always is poignant when you have a player of that ilk passing away. We'll show our respects by wearing the black armbands. ""He's a well known figure and familiar face, you can't mistake him. He was around the place quite a lot. He was always a friendly face who would come and say hello. ""Personally, he was very good to have rugby conversations with. He'll be sadly missed and the guys are well aware of what he's achieved in the game."" The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) offered its condolences, saying: ""All our thoughts are with JJ's family and friends at this sad time."" Williams' former Wales and Lions team-mate, scrum-half legend Sir Gareth Edwards, said: ""A lot of people thought that JJ Williams was just a sprinter and out and out runner, but he had far more than that. ""Having been the outside-half for the Welsh schoolboys he had the ability to read the game and the knack to be in the right place at the right time. ""I spent many an our preparing for international matches and loathe to say training with him because I used to pull his leg quite often and say when we were half way through a session 'that's enough John, I'm ready'.

""He'd say 'oh, no no we're not' - typical athlete; wanted more, wanted to give more. ""But I was fortunate to be in a Welsh side when we had some very capable players and John epitomised the mood of that time. ""We had Gerald Davies on one wing as elusive as anybody, as slippery as an eel and JJ, an out-and-out sprinter, but very, very talented and capable of turning games in a moment. ""And indeed [I was lucky] to have toured with the British and Irish Lions with him. ""So over the years I've been very fortunate to sit back and admire his talents."" Edwards' former Wales and Lions half-back partner - another legend of the game - Phil Bennett played alongside Williams for Llanelli. ""I've had so many colleagues and old friends and rugby players phoning me; some of the great names from the past and everybody devastated by the news that JJ has gone and left us,"" said Bennett. ""A wonderful rugby player, great friend andâ¦ it only seemed like yesterday he was tearing up South Africa, ripping them apart and scoring tries for fun - a truly remarkable player. ""I can remember him joining Llanelli in 1972 and it was our centenary year and the great Carwyn James was coaching and we had a few star players come in - Tommy David, Chico Hopkins - and he said 'I've got the one man I wanted to join us, JJ Williams. He's a flier on the wing, we've got a good back division, let's get him the ball and he'll score the tries for us'. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""What took him to my heart, when he joined Llanelli I though 'hang on, is he coming here because it's our centenary year - is he just coming here to join a club that's celebrating things?' ""But he went on to play nine seasons for my beloved Scarlets; 223 games, didn't pull out of the hard cup games away to Pontypool and Neath etc and he endeared himself to the fans who loved him down here and, indeed, loved him all over Wales and it's very sad for John and his family, who worshipped him."" Williams played for Llanelli when they famously beat New Zealand 9-3 at Stradey Park in 1972. The club said: ""It is with great sadness that we hear of the passing of the great JJ Williams. ""We would like to extend our sincerest condolences to his family, friends and former team-mates."" One of Williams' former clubs, Bridgend, tweeted on Thursday morning: ""All at Bridgend Ravens are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of former player JJ Williams. ""Our thoughts are with JJ's family and friends at this tough time."" Former Wales second row Craig Quinnell, Williams' godson, was another to pay tribute, tweeting: ""It's with a heavy heart I write this. My godfather. My friend.

"Pizza Express will cut 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after sales dipped amid more coronavirus cases and restrictions. The losses come weeks after the firm said it would cut 1,100 jobs and close 73 restaurants. No further restaurants will close, it says, with this volley of losses split across the remaining sites. City centres are worst hit by the restrictions, it said, as diners stay at home or order food in. ""Our aim throughout these extremely challenging times has been to keep our team members and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible,"" Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director said. ""Unfortunately, the recent increase in Covid-19 cases is again causing footfall to decline across the UK."" The company didn't say which roles are likely to be cut, nor which locations will lose staff. Pizza Express went through a restructuring in the summer to cut its rental costs, which led to the first volley of job cuts and closed venues. The company, which began with one restaurant in London's SoHo district in 1965, is majority-owned by Chinese investor Hony Capital, which bought it for Â£900m in 2014.

"Gail says it's sad not being able to see family members, but people will make more effort When aleading medical expert urged peopleto prepare for a ""digital Christmas"" last week, the response was mixed. But amid the frustration and ""mistletoe and Zoom"" jokes, some people were already rearranging their plans. ""I imagine the iPad and FaceTime will be on pretty much the whole day on Christmas Day,"" says Gail Buckie, from Edinburgh. Gail's family live about 150 miles away on the Isle of Mull and she says ""there's no way we'll be able to see them over Christmas"" - especially with her mother considered vulnerable. But she says she's already putting ""a lot more effort"" into this year's festivities - and has even booked Santa to visit her children at her doorstep because they won't be able to go to a grotto like usual. Christmas guidance 'should be same across UK' Victoria Derbyshire sorry for Christmas comments ""We've already started to stock up on extra Christmas lights,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think I've probably, in the past, been a bit more 'less is more' type thing, but with the children spending so much time inside, we're going to decorate their bedroom. ""It will be just a wee small thing for us,"" she says. ""But we'll make it extra special trying to keep connected."" It's still too early to say what Christmas will be like for everyone. But current restrictions in Scotland ban people from visiting other households indoors, while in England, millions of people are living under tier two or three restrictions, which also ban visiting others at home. In Wales, there is currently a national lockdown requiring people to stay indoors, while in Northern Ireland indoor visits to other people's homes are also not allowed. What are the new rules across the UK? What are the rules in your area? That means Gail isn't alone in planning a digital Christmas Day. Mhairi Hamilton, from Larkhall, in South Lanarkshire, says she is ""ahead of the curve"" and has already cancelled her big family Christmas to avoid months of uncertainty. ""So I called it about six weeks ago and put a message round the family saying that I was not going to host in the house but I would host a Zoom Christmas,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I would preserve what we could of the family traditions and we would take it from there. And the response I got from the extended family was nothing but positive. You know, things like, 'you mean we can do this in our jammies? You mean we don't have to drive?'. I'm going, yes, yes, yes."" Mhairi is currently in the process of making gift bags for her relatives, which will be filled with drinks and nibbles, and the whole family will open their Secret Santa presents on a video call. ""I'm ahead of the game and I'm loving it,"" she says. ""I'm having a great time preparing. There are undoubtedly many, many positives to be taken from it."" Becky Goddard-Hill, a parenting blogger from Nottingham, is equally positive. ""I think we can still have that family gathering but just in a different way,"" she says. She's planning a carol concert with members of her family over video call, and a cook-a-long with her mother-in-law to bake a Christmas cake. ""I'll get my kids to open their advent calendar with their grandparents online each morning just so they're still very, very much a part of our Christmas and there's still a lot of fun and togetherness at the heart of it,"" she says. ""It will probably be absolute chaos but I think that's part of the fun, isn't it? It's that being together, throwing your enthusiasm behind it."" She also suggests watching a film together at the same time as relatives living elsewhere, or sending handmade cards and long handwritten letters. But for some, the prospect of a virtual Christmas is nothing but unappealing - especially if they will be on their own. ""This Christmas my husband, a serving soldier, will be at work on Christmas Day, and my brother, who I would normally spend Christmas Day with, died in August,"" says Helen Kemp, 56, who lives in the Yorkshire Dales. ""I don't have children and other than my cousin, who has invited me for Christmas Day to her house, I don't have any close relatives nearby anymore."" Helen says she will spend Christmas morning at work - at a charity that gives discounted holidays to vulnerable people, including the homeless. ""But after that, I really didn't want to have to spend the rest of the day, until my husband comes home at half six at night, on my own."" Her area is currently in tier one - medium alert - where household mixing is still allowed in groups of up to six. But ""who knows what we will be by Christmas"", she adds. ""It has been a tough year for all of us and we need to have some normality back into our lives. ""Spending Christmas Day with family, rather than alone, is a way of normalising our lives again. ""I don't think anyone wants to be alone on Christmas Day, let alone after the year we have all had."" Earlier this week,No 10 said it wasPrime Minister Boris Johnson's ""ambition"" for people to celebrate Christmas with their families. But many scientists and politicians have taken a different view. Scotland's national clinical directorJason Leitch said it was""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas - but it was ""not going to be normal"". ""People should get their digital Christmas ready,"" he said. Prof John Edmunds, who sits on Sage,said the ideathat people could ""carry on as we are"" and then have a normal Christmas with friends and family was ""wishful thinking in the extreme"". Andanother Sage scientist saidlast week that Christmas was unlikely to be the ""usual celebration"" of ""families coming together"".

Under tier three - also known as ""very high"" - restrictions, there can be no mixing of households indoors or ourdoors in private gardens. Pubs and bars that do not serve substantial food must close and people are advised to avoid travel out of the area. Overnight stays are banned and you cannot hold a wedding reception. In addition, casinos, soft play, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales must shut in West Yorkshire. Shisha cafes will not be allowed to serve shisha but may operate as cafe. Redcar could soon join tier three Local leaders in the Tees Valley area of the north-east of England say the government has informed them of its intention to put the region into tier three restrictions. A statement on behalf of the leaders of Redcar and Cleveland, Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool Councils, the mayor of Middlesbrough and the Tees Valley mayor, said further discussions would take place on Friday with nothing agreed as yet. Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council leader Mary Lanigan, speaking on behalf of he group, said: âThe government informed us late last night of their intention to take the Tees Valley into tier three restrictions. ""We have had an initial meeting with ministers this afternoon where they again stressed this intention due to the current infection rate and the increased number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19."" Nottinghamshire is expected to receive Â£23.1m in funding to support businesses and managing Covid-19 enforcement as it enters tier three restrictions. The funding will see a Â£16.5m business support scheme for firms in the county and Â£6.6m for managing systems like NHS test and trace locally. The figure excludes Nottingham city, which will receive its own funding. The news comes as the whole of the county enters the highest coronavirus restrictions in England on Friday. Under Nottinghamshire's tier three restrictions alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Deaths and hospital admissions related to coronavirus are continuing to rise across the UK, with the number of patients in hospital with Covid now around half of what it was at the peak in spring. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm People living in Stockholm and the Swedish regions of VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland and ÃstergÃ¶tland have been advised against going to gyms, museums, libraries, swimming pools and shopping centres until 19 November. They have also been told to avoid physical contact with people they do not live with. This follows similar restrictions introduced in the regions of Uppsala County and SkÃ¥ne last week, following an uptick of infections in these areas. All regions with tougher guidelines will keep the current limit of 50 people at public events. National guidelines are set to change on 1 November, allowing public gatherings of up to 300 people, as long as social distancing measures are in place. Social clubs in Lancashire say they are ""bitterly disappointed"" after the UK government closed an apparent loophole that allowed them to serve alcohol while in the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Under tier three rules,pubs and bars must closeunless they serve substantial meals. But some social clubs were continuing to serve alcohol without foodafter their local councils told them this was permitted. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde had all advised social clubs that the discrepancy existed because they held club premises certificates, rather than premises licences. But the government has since clarified that social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they also serve substantial meals. A club in Preston said its business would now ""slowly die"", although the treasurer of another club said the rule change was expected because someone had ""ticked the wrong box and not thought about us"".

Three Sinn FÃ©in offices received the payments, which have since been repaid. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"", saying the grant was lodged into a joint account of which she is a named signature with her husband.

That means, from this Sunday, people arriving from those countries will have to  self-isolate for two weeks. The decision comes after a rise in coronavirus cases in both countries. Lithuania's seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 people has reached 140, while Cyprus is on 112.

People are being urged not to travel into or out of council areas where there are level three restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people in hospital with Covid has risen to more than 10,000. This is half the level it was at the peak in spring and the highest number for nearly six months. It comes after a sustained rise in admissions since September. It means around one in 13 hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients. That may not sound a lot, but there are two things to remember. Firstly, hospital capacity has been affected by the need for social distancing and the segregation of wards, meaning not all beds can be used. Secondly, the admissions have not been evenly distributed. The north west of England is caring for nearly a quarter of the patients. That has left hospitals in places like Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool very close to capacity, although there are signs the rise in admissions may be levelling off. Pizza Express says it is cutting around 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after recent trading worsened due to tightened Covid restrictions. It comes two months after therestaurant chain revealed
plans to cut 1,100 roles and close 73 of its restaurants. No further restaurant sites will shut as a result of the latest cuts, it said. The chain said its city centre sites had been ""particularly hard-hit"" while some of its suburban and out-of-town locations had seen more resilient trading. Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director, said the chain's aim had been to keep staff and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible but the rise in coronavirus cases had caused footfall to decline across the UK and expected that to continue for ""some months"". The chain was doing ""what we can"" to support those affected, she said, adding that the cuts will ""give us more resilience through the next six months"" and enable it to continue serving customers in its restaurants and at home in the ""years ahead"". At least 175 people have tested positive for coronavirus at a meat processing factory in Norfolk. All 1,000 workers at Cranswick Country Foods in Watton are being tested after staff in the butchery section were found to have Covid-19. Breckland Council officials and NHS Test and Trace staff have been deployed to Watton for ""reassurance"". Four positive cases in the butchery department were confirmed on 15 October and testing was brought in five days later. Testing between 22 and 23 October found 175 cases. Norfolk's director of public health Dr Louise Smith said 350 workers had been tested so far. Read the full story here.

Wolverhampton is currently in tier two, with a ban on mixing indoors. Supt Simon Inglis said it was a ""reckless breach of Covid rules"" at a time when the virus was spreading. When police arrived at the home, the male organiser told them around 20 people were present but officers said they found more than 40 partygoers at the property. Told the party was a breach of Covid rules, the organiser told officers: ""Oh my god, I spent too much money on this party. Give me one hour."" The economy has reopened but full recovery remains out of reach, especially in cities such as New York The US economy emerged quickly from the depths of the crisis triggered by coronavirus lockdowns earlier this year, but full recovery remains out of reach, official figures show. The economy grew at a record 7.4% in the three months to 30 September from the previous quarter, when it suffered a severe decline. But output remained 2.9% lower compared to the same period a year ago and analysts warn the rebound may be running out of steam. ""Overall, the initial recovery in GDP after the first wave of lockdowns were lifted was stronger than we originally anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""But, with coronavirus infections hitting a record high in recent days and any additional fiscal stimulus unlikely to arrive until, at the earliest, the start of next year, further progress will be much slower.""

"John Rosenow (left) makes trips to Mexico to meet relatives of his workers like Roberto Ending illegal immigration was a signature promise when Donald Trump swept to power in 2016. But on the ground it's a more complex picture - and for one farmer in Wisconsin, undocumented workers have been a lifeline. And he's going to extraordinary lengths to repay them. The paved road suddenly ends and all the numbers and street signs disappear along with it, turning into a gravel path cutting through green and golden pastures. On one side of the path, there are small signs with slogans that are difficult to read from the vehicle. ""It is about the climate,"" one seems to say. ""It is about you,"" is written on the next one. Soon after, there is a much larger one, hanging on a fence: ""Vote November 3. Wisconsinites for Biden."" It is the first sign in several miles showing support for the Democratic presidential candidate. ""My wife is the one with the signs. I used to be that kind of guy. But now I just put them up,"" says farmer John Rosenow amidst laughter, at his house in Waumandee. Rosenow says he is an exception in this small community, one of the counties in Wisconsin that gave President Donald Trump his surprise victory in 2016. In Rosenow's neighbourhood, Biden signs are a rarity Wisconsin had not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since the 1980s but it went narrowly for Trump, in part because of strong support for him in rural enclaves like this one. Rosenow's family is well known in the area for being part of a project that helped knock down barriers between the US and Mexico. They call it Puentes [bridges]. ""This is Roberto driving by. You'll meet him sometime. Last night we went to play golf together. He's got the golf bug really badâ¦ so do I,"" Rosenow says, pointing to a man driving a loud vehicle down the road. Mexican immigrant Roberto Tecpile has worked for six years in this dairy farm. ""He's been here since 4am, feeding cows"", Rosenow says at around midday. A few hours after that, Tecpile will still be at the farm. Did Trump stop more people coming to the US? A really simple guide to the US election On a September morning, Rosenow's business, Rosenholm Dairy, seems to be operating with clockwork-like efficiency. But the situation now is drastically different to what they experienced in the 1990s, when nobody seemed to want to work here. ""It was 1998. We could no longer hire people locally so we decided reluctantly to hire immigrants. I hired the first one through a company out of Texas,"" the farmer remembers. ""He worked for two months and he was wonderful. But he was lonely because he was the only Mexican within 100 miles, so he left"". It was the beginning of an inflow of migrants, many of them undocumented. They ended up saving Rosenow's farm and that of many others in this corner of Wisconsin, during a time of acute labour shortages. The number of immigrants working in the dairy sector nowadays is difficult to establish. A national study, conducted five years ago for the National Milk Producers Federation, estimated they represented 51.2% of the labour force and that farms employing immigrants provided 79% of the US milk supply. Mexicans solved a crucial problem for the farmers in Waumandee - finding workers willing to perform hard physical tasks from 4am to 5pm or even later, in temperatures that can fall below -10C (14F) in winter. But their arrival presented a new challenge. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? ""I realised early on that not knowing the Spanish language or anything about the culture, it was a real negative for me. If I was going to be a good employer, I needed to know all that stuff,"" Rosenow remembers. He and other farmers approached the local high school Spanish teacher, Shaun Duvall, for help. And she proposed that they went on an ""immersion trip"" to Mexico. ""It was just an eye-opening experience,"" he recalls. Rosenow has travelled to Mexico 10 times Fifteen farmers joined on the first trip, which included classes in the morning and in the afternoon. On one of their free days, it occurred to one of the farmers that they could go meet the relatives of their Mexican workers - a visit their Latino employees can't risk. It was just the beginning of something bigger. Rosenow helped to raise money to help support the initiative and get more people to go. Up to 200 people, mostly farmers, have made the trip now. ""And I've been down there nine or 10 times,"" he says. What US farmers make of Trump's trade deal US-China trade war: A soy bean farmer's view A cheerful Mercedes Falk shows up in the farm, and many of the Latino workers turn up to say hello. ""Hola! Shall we meet later at English class?"" That same afternoon she was due to give a free class to interested workers at the farm's premises, another initiative spearheaded by Rosenow. ""I've been to Mexico four times now,"" says Falk. ""It is heart-breaking especially to hear moms talking about how much they miss their sons. One mom in particular she said 'It's been 15 years and I have not seen him in that long'. And you can just feel her heart breaking and that part sticks with you."" Mercedes Falk teaches English to farm workers in the area Falk took over Puentes, the NGO created to run this programme, in 2017, after falling in love with country life and leaving her birthplace in the Milwaukee area. The trips have changed substantially since they first started. The main objective is no longer to take Spanish classes but to visit their employees' families. ""We usually spend seven days, visiting families and doing some tourism in the area close to the rural villages where they live,"" Falk says. ""I do my best to arrange all the visits, butâ¦ it is Mexico, everything could change,"" she says laughing.  ""That also helps the farmers to understand the mentality of their Mexican workers, they live day by day"". Rosenow and Falk on a trip to Mexico The immigration controversies under President Trump have made the programme even more relevant in this community. Waumandee voted for Trump in 2016, choosing him over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 188 votes to 87. Several of Rosenow's neighbours have already placed Trump signs in the doors of their houses or businesses. But the social tensions felt in other parts of the country are not immediately apparent in this rural corner of America. ""I understand that Trump supporters are actually good people and I get along with them. If our cows got out in the middle of the night, they would be the first ones here to help us put them in,"" Rosenow says. Still, Trump's election in 2016 brought some nervousness to the area. Many migrant workers returned home soon after, leaving some Wisconsin farmers again facing labour shortages. Rosenow sees the deep political division in his own community ""They need workers. If Trump takes them awayâ¦ it will create problems,"" Roberto Tecpile says. The Trump administration has cracked down on illegal immigration because it believes it takes American jobs and drives down wages. As president he followed through on his campaign promises by deporting thousands - a move popular with many of his supporters. But there are still millions of undocumented immigrants, many of them working in industries like agriculture that rely on them. Roberto Tecpile first came to the US when he was single, risking his life by walking across the desert for two days and two nights. He kept returning, now as a married man. Last time he departed Mexico, he left behind an infant daughter and two other children. ""We can only live like this. When you have family, you have more responsibilities. There is no money there,"" he says about his home in Mexico's Veracruz state. Who will be the next US president? You decide Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate Why we might not get a result on election night Did Trump stop more people coming to US? Full coverage of the US election One of his colleagues, Moises, who is 27, says he is planning to return soon to Mexico after several years in this farm. ""I am leaving before the cold arrives. It is very hard,"" he says, nervously. He is not sure he will come back. Immigrants frequently take the hardest jobs in the dairy industry. A 2009 study from the University of Wisconsin found that they were often relegated to routine, lower-paid tasks, like milking the cows or cleaning manure in the barns, a report at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said. Dairy workers averaged 57 hours of work a week and fewer than five days off each month. Tecpile, from Veracruz, Mexico, has worked on the dairy farm for six years As Tecpile raises a fence in the field, under the blazing sun, his mobile phone rings and you can hear a voice speaking a language I can't understand. ""It is my wife, she is speaking in NÃ¡huatl [an indigenous language of Mexico],"" he says. ""Ãrale, are you with your boss or with who?"" his wife says, now in Spanish. She starts to share some of her concerns in a timid but sweet voice. ""Sometimes I am worried about my husband, and about Kevin, my son.""

"This video can not be played In comments before his suspension from Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism complaints numbers were ""exaggerated"" Labour has suspended Jeremy Corbyn from the party over his reaction to a highly critical report on anti-Semitism. The human rights watchdog found Labour responsible for ""unlawful"" harassment and discrimination during Mr Corbyn's four-and-a-half years as leader. But he later said the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated"" by opponents. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn was being suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Mr Corbyn reacted by calling the move ""political"" and promised to ""strongly contest"" it. The suspension will remain in place while the party carries out an investigation into his remarks. What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour's agony over anti-Semitism far from over Sir Keir Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, said the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's (EHRC) report had brought ""a day of shame"" for the party. It found Labour responsible forthree breaches of the Equality Act:,external Political interference in anti-Semitism complaints Failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints Harassment, including the use of anti-Semitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of anti-Semitism were fake or smears The EHRC found evidence of 23 instances of ""inappropriate involvement"" by Mr Corbyn's office. Sir Keir, who served under Mr Corbyn as shadow Brexit secretary, promised to implement the report's recommendations ""as soon as possible in the New Year"". This seems not to have been a deliberately designed collision between the current party boss and his predecessor. But this was an explosive political parting of ways, provoked in part by Mr Corbyn's trademark determination not to bend. This is an attribute admired by many of his devotees, a frustration abhorred by his detractors and a sadness to those in Labour who believe it coloured the party's handling of anti-Semitism. For Sir Keir, this episode does, perhaps by accident rather than design, prove beyond doubt his slogan - Labour is under new leadership - to be true. Read Laura's blog Responding to the EHRC's findings, Mr Corbyn said he was ""always determined to eliminate all forms of racism"". He claimed his team had ""acted to speed up, not hinder the process"" and that the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party"". Shortly afterwards Labour general secretary David Evans suspended Mr Corbyn. The party said this was ""in light of his comments"" and ""his failure to retract them subsequently"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer ""disappointed"" with Corbyn's response Mr Corbyn, Labour leader from 2015 until this year, reacted on Twitter, promising to ""strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me"". He said those who denied the party had an anti-Semitism problem were ""wrong"" and he would ""continue to support a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of racism"".

He added: ""I was very disappointed in Jeremy Corbyn's statement and appropriate action has been taken, which I fully support."" Sir Keir said would not ""interfere"" with the party's internal investigation into Mr Corbyn's statement. Labour has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since 2016, with a number of MPs quitting the party in protest while Mr Corbyn was leader. Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: ""[The suspension] is the right decision following Corbyn's shameful reaction to the EHRC report."" The party was ""finally saying enough is enough, anti-Semitism can never be tolerated"", she added. This video can not be played Speaking before he was suspended, Ex-Labour MP Luciana Berger accuses Mr Corbyn of anti-Semitism Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Jeremy is a thoroughly decent man, but he has an absolute blind spot and a denial when it comes to some of these issues."" But groups on the left of the Labour movement attacked the decision to suspend him. The Socialist Campaign Group said it ""firmly"" opposed the move, adding: ""We will work tirelessly for his reinstatement."" And Momentum, among Mr Corbyn's strongest backers, said: ""It is a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity."" For the Conservatives, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has written to Sir Keir, saying he ""seemingly found it much harder to find the moral character and backbone to do what was right"" while serving in the shadow cabinet under Mr Corbyn. The EHRC launched its investigation last year after receiving a number of complaints from organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism and the Jewish Labour Movement.

"This video can not be played Concerns were raised about a surge in infections and the economic impact on the region. West Yorkshire is to be placed under tier three Covid restrictions from Monday, the strictest level of rules. The area - home to an estimated 2.3 million people - includes the cities of Leeds and Bradford. The government has promised a further financial package of more than Â£59.3m for the region. Casinos, soft play, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales will be shut, as well as pubs and bars not serving substantial meals. Under the tier three - very high alert - rules, there can also be no mixing of households indoors or outdoors, including in private gardens. It comes asa major study of Covid-19 in Englandsuggested that Yorkshire and the Humber, where one in every 37 people has the virus and includes West Yorkshire, is the country's worst affected area, followed by the North West region. When West Yorkshire goes into tier three from 00:01 GMT on 2 November, 11 million people - nearly a fifth of all those living in England - will be under the tightest coronavirus restrictions. Tighter Covid restrictions for millions in England Sturgeon unveils Scotland's Covid alert levels Nearly 100,000 catching virus every day - study A statement from the Leaders of West Yorkshire Councils said they accepted the move into tier three ""with great reluctance"". ""The virus spread is now at a critical juncture. Not only are infections rising in our region, particularly amongst the elderly, but we already have evidence that the NHS is starting to struggle to deliver essential elective care,"" it continued. Bradford currently has the highest Covid rates in the county, with 483.5 cases per 100,000 of the population in the week to 24 October. Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of Bradford council and chair of the West Yorkshire combined authority, warned that ""further economic restrictions"" would be ""damaging"" for businesses and jobs. She accused the government of ""seriously underestimating the economic impact"" of restrictions and vowed that local leaders would ""challenge"" it to ""improve upon them"". This video can not be played The BBC's Fergus Walsh spoke to two volunteers who are taking part in the trial Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said Leeds hospitals had ""exceeded the peak position we were in earlier this year in April"". Hospitals in the city are currently treating 268 patients with Covid - up from 158 last week. The neighbouring areas of South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Lancashire are already under tier three restrictions, as well as the Liverpool City Region and Warrington.Nottinghamshire goes into tier three from Friday. The government's financial package is in addition to the business grant arrangements previously announced by the Chancellor when the area was place under tier two rules. Council leaders said the package could be broken down into two per-head figures: A one-off additional amount of Â£20 per head: for West Yorkshire - estimated to be worth Â£46.6m in additional funding A total of Â£8 per head to support enhanced test and trace and contain measures, resulting in an additional Â£12.7m They said they had been promised further conversations with government ministers to discuss local schemes ""to build on and continue to support the economic recovery of the region"". West Yorkshire is made up of five council areas - Calderdale, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield. Residents are advised to avoid travelling outside the area, unless for essential journeys, such as work or caring responsibilities. Gyms may continue to open, but the guidance is against indoor exercise classes taking place. THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Victoria Eaton, Director of Public Health for Leeds, said the rate of infection in Leeds was ""still growing in Leeds though not as steeply as the increase in other areas, both in West Yorkshire and in Yorkshire and Humber"". She said the latest daily rate was 416.7 per 100,000. The rate of infection is now highest among 30-44 year olds but ""most worryingly we are seeing increases among our over 65 age group, which as we know is an early warning of future hospital admissions"". Judith Blake, Leeds City Council leader, said: ""This is obviously a very difficult decision for anyone to take. We realise the significance of the economic impact that this will have but we're very mindful of the fact the virus is at a state where we need to take measures, particularly with regard to our hospital admissions."" In other key developments: The UK reported another 23,065 cases of coronavirus on Thursday, and a further 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955 Nearly 100,000 people are catching coronavirus every day in England, with the number of positive cases doubling every nine days, the React-1 study by Imperial College London suggests Millions more people in areas of Yorkshire and the Humber, parts of the West and East Midlands, as well as Luton and Oxford Citywill move to tier two restrictions from Saturday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier unveiledScotland's new five-tier Covid measures, which will come into force from 06:00 on Monday of next week, but has not ruled out another national lockdown The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus in Wales continues to increase- up nearly a quarter on last week.

"Social contacts in Germany will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of a long, hard winter ahead as she defended the reinstatement of a national lockdown. Mrs Merkel was heckled by right-wing MPs as she outlined the new measures in parliament. Rising coronavirus infections and deaths are triggering tougher restrictions across Europe. France restores a lockdown on Friday, ordering people to stay at home except for essential work or medical reasons. President Emmanuel Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Daily Covid deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Thursday, authorities reported 47,637 new cases compared to 36,437 a day earlier and 235 new deaths, nine fewer than on Wednesday. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? German health officials said on Thursday that another 89 people had died in the past 24 hours, with a record 16,774 infections. Germany's new measures, which come into force on Monday, are not as far-reaching as in France, but they include the closure of restaurants, bars, gyms and theatres, Mrs Merkel said. The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and an additional 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955. In England,a new study shows almost 100,000 people are catching the virus every day, putting pressure on the government to change policy from a regional approach. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the continent was ""deep in the second wave"". ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas,"" she said. This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November The first wave of the virus earlier this year hit some parts of Europe incredibly hard, while other areas were able to escape the worst. President Macron warned the second wave ""no doubt will be harder than the first"" Italy, Spain, France and the UK were among the worst-hit nations, with all imposing strict national lockdowns that over time brought cases, hospital admissions and deaths down to a very low level but ravaged economies. Restrictions started to lift in the early summer, with non-essential shops, bars and restaurants reopening, and travel restarting. But in August cases began to rise again, with a major acceleration in recent weeks that has alarmed policymakers. Countries that were not hit badly by the first wave - such as the Czech Republic and Poland - have not been spared this time, with experts warning of alarming infection rates across much of the continent. Addressing parliament on Thursday Mrs Merkel said that ""winter will be hard - four long, difficult months - but it will come to an end"". ""This pandemic brings the question of freedom to the fore. Freedom is not 'every man for himself', it is responsibility - for oneself, one's family, the workplace. It shows us we are part of a whole,"" she said. During her speech, Mrs Merkel was heckled by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party who oppose the restrictions. Leader Alexander Gauland accused the government of ""corona dictatorship"". In response, Mrs Merkel warned that disinformation and conspiracy theories undermined the fight against the pandemic. The AfD has staged protests against the government's coronavirus measures Germany, like other countries,has seen protests by people claiming restrictions are unwarranted. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed the government. Germany's partial lockdown will last until 30 November under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers. Bars and restaurants will close except for takeaway, but schools and kindergartens will remain open.

"Robyn Goldie was neglected during the last year of her life with mother Sharon A mother who left her dying 13-year-old daughter on the sofa while she went to the pub has been jailed for three years and six months. Robyn Goldie developed peritonitis and died in July 2018 after her mother Sharon Goldie failed to seek medical treatment for her. She suffered a perforated duodenal ulcer. The court heard the teenager had tried to get medical help the week before, but her mother had stopped her. Sharon Goldie, 45,pleaded guilty at a previous court hearingto wilful ill treatment and neglect of her daughter over the period of a year from July 2017 and July 2018. She admitted failing to provide her daughter with adequate food, clothing or heating, hitting her, and permitting her to smoke cannabis and drink alcohol. Mother went to pub while daughter lay dying Goldie, from Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty to exposing her to unhygienic living conditions including cat urine and cat faeces, which led to her getting fleas. Sentencing her in a High Court sitting at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday, Lord Beckett told Goldie she showed ""considerable cruelty over a prolonged period"" and said there was no alternative to a custodial sentence. Sharon Goldie was sentenced at Edinburgh Sheriff Court He said: ""Even if your daughter could sometimes be challenging and difficult, she was subjected to a terrible ordeal of neglect and ill treatment by you over a long period. ""You had enough money to provide food for your daughter but chose not to and purchased alcohol and cannabis, you gave this to your daughter instead of adequate nutrition."" The court heard Robyn was feeling unwell in the week before her death and by 24 July was pale and shivering, and said she needed an ambulance but her mother refused. She also refused a friend's offer to take Robyn to hospital in a taxi. On 25 July, Robyn was in the garden asking a neighbour to help her get an ambulance and saying she could not breathe but again Goldie intervened and took her back inside. Describing  26 July, the day Robyn died, Lord Beckett said: ""Your daughter was in pain that afternoon, you gave her a painkiller and went to the pub. ""By the time you came home she was slumped on the sofa but you and your friend went into the garden to have a drink because the weather was nice. ""She was dead an hour later."" Prosecutors accepted Goldie's not guilty plea to a charge of culpable homicide. The court heard Goldie suffered a serious traumatic brain injury when she was nine, which affected her cognitively and physically and had an impact on her ability to manage over the years Solicitor advocate Marco Guarino, representing Goldie said: ""This is a lady who clearly has difficulties both mentally and physically, impacting on her ability in how to view things and the consequences of actions or omissions and I think that lies at the root of her culpability in this case. ""There is no punishment this court can impose that will be greater than the one she is suffering just now as a result of her actions, the death of her child.""

"Pizza Express will cut 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after sales dipped amid more coronavirus cases and restrictions. The losses come weeks after the firm said it would cut 1,100 jobs and close 73 restaurants. No further restaurants will close, it says, with this volley of losses split across the remaining sites. City centres are worst hit by the restrictions, it said, as diners stay at home or order food in. ""Our aim throughout these extremely challenging times has been to keep our team members and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible,"" Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director said. ""Unfortunately, the recent increase in Covid-19 cases is again causing footfall to decline across the UK."" The company didn't say which roles are likely to be cut, nor which locations will lose staff. Pizza Express went through a restructuring in the summer to cut its rental costs, which led to the first volley of job cuts and closed venues. The company, which began with one restaurant in London's SoHo district in 1965, is majority-owned by Chinese investor Hony Capital, which bought it for Â£900m in 2014. Two weeks ago Mitchells & Butlers, the pubs and restaurants group, said it had begun redundancy consultations with a number of staff as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. M&B, whose chains include Harvester and All Bar One, has about 1,700 pubs and restaurants and 44,000 employees. It has not yet disclosed how many jobs are at risk. The cuts came amid warnings over large job cuts in large cities like London, where city centre bars and restaurants are particularly hard hit as diners stay at home. Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body UK Hospitality . Chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. British employers planned making redundancies at close to a record level last month, as the second wave of coronavirus took its toll on jobs. Some 1,734 employers notified the government of plans to cut 20 or more posts, close to the peak levels seen in June and July, according to data released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information request.

"The new rules come into force from Saturday Oxford is to be placed under tier 2 Covid-19 restrictions after a rise of cases in the city. Oxfordshire County Council said the central government decision followed ""intensive discussions"" between the local authorities and MPs. The number of cases in the city per 100,000 rose to 137.1 for the week ending 23 October. The new rules come into force from Saturday. The rest of the county will remain in tier 1. Council leaders have been pushing for a move to tier 2since last week. The number of cases in the city per 100,000 rose to 134.5 for the week ending 23 October Ian Hudspeth, leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said it was the ""appropriate moment"" for the tier change but expressed serious concerns the rest of the county had not followed suit. ""We are deeply disappointed that despite clear evidence showing the virus is now spreading to older and more vulnerable communities across the county, our request that Oxfordshire as a whole should move to tier 2 was not approved,"" he said. For Oxfordshire as a whole, the most recent rate was at 117.5 per 100,000 people. The authority said the virus was spreading ""to a much wider age range across the county and is no longer confined to younger people in urban areas"". All six Oxfordshire councils supported moving the entire county into tier 2. Bruno Holthof, chief executive officer at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""We have moved from a position of low and stable hospital admission rates over the summer to one in which admission rates are increasing. ""We know there is a time lag between rising cases and an increase in hospital admissions, and so we expect to see a further increase in hospitalisation rates over the coming weeks."" Susan Brown, leader of Oxford City Council, said the decision not to put the whole county into tier 2 was ""shocking"", adding ""the spread and case numbers outside the city are also of grave concern... when so many people commute into our city"". Anneliese Dodds, Labour MP for Oxford East, said: ""I am sure people in the city will take these new measures very seriously and I urge everyone to comply."" But she said she was ""concerned that evidence of the need for steps to be taken across Oxfordshire has not been taken on board"" by the Department of Health, which has been contacted for comment. In a joint statement the county's four Conservative MPs, Robert Courts, John Howell, David Johnston and Victoria Prentis, said: ""Public health is the priority and we hope this will stop the spread of the virus. ""We do not want to see the rest of Oxfordshire put into tier 2, as council leaders have been requesting, if it can be avoided and given the impact this would have on individuals, families and businesses. ""We therefore strongly urge everyone today to redouble their efforts... and help prevent the rest of the county needing to be placed into tier 2.""

"Social contacts in Germany will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of a long, hard winter ahead as she defended the reinstatement of a national lockdown. Mrs Merkel was heckled by right-wing MPs as she outlined the new measures in parliament. Rising coronavirus infections and deaths are triggering tougher restrictions across Europe. France restores a lockdown on Friday, ordering people to stay at home except for essential work or medical reasons. President Emmanuel Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Daily Covid deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Thursday, authorities reported 47,637 new cases compared to 36,437 a day earlier and 235 new deaths, nine fewer than on Wednesday. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? German health officials said on Thursday that another 89 people had died in the past 24 hours, with a record 16,774 infections. Germany's new measures, which come into force on Monday, are not as far-reaching as in France, but they include the closure of restaurants, bars, gyms and theatres, Mrs Merkel said. The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and an additional 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955. In England,a new study shows almost 100,000 people are catching the virus every day, putting pressure on the government to change policy from a regional approach. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the continent was ""deep in the second wave"". ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas,"" she said. This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November The first wave of the virus earlier this year hit some parts of Europe incredibly hard, while other areas were able to escape the worst. President Macron warned the second wave ""no doubt will be harder than the first"" Italy, Spain, France and the UK were among the worst-hit nations, with all imposing strict national lockdowns that over time brought cases, hospital admissions and deaths down to a very low level but ravaged economies. Restrictions started to lift in the early summer, with non-essential shops, bars and restaurants reopening, and travel restarting. But in August cases began to rise again, with a major acceleration in recent weeks that has alarmed policymakers. Countries that were not hit badly by the first wave - such as the Czech Republic and Poland - have not been spared this time, with experts warning of alarming infection rates across much of the continent. Addressing parliament on Thursday Mrs Merkel said that ""winter will be hard - four long, difficult months - but it will come to an end"". ""This pandemic brings the question of freedom to the fore. Freedom is not 'every man for himself', it is responsibility - for oneself, one's family, the workplace. It shows us we are part of a whole,"" she said. During her speech, Mrs Merkel was heckled by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party who oppose the restrictions. Leader Alexander Gauland accused the government of ""corona dictatorship"". In response, Mrs Merkel warned that disinformation and conspiracy theories undermined the fight against the pandemic. The AfD has staged protests against the government's coronavirus measures Germany, like other countries,has seen protests by people claiming restrictions are unwarranted. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed the government. Germany's partial lockdown will last until 30 November under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers. Bars and restaurants will close except for takeaway, but schools and kindergartens will remain open. Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted. In terms of economic help, smaller companies and the self-employed badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings.

Social gatherings are banned. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". ""Like all our neighbours, we are submerged by the sudden acceleration of the virus,"" said Mr Macron. Prime Minister Jean Castex told parliament on Thursday that all students aged six and over would have to wear face masks in class ""to protect all our children, teachers and parents"". Until now masks have only been mandatory for students aged 11 and older. Jean Castex said greater effort was needed to stop the spread of the coronavirus He said companies would be strongly urged to have their employees work from home ""five days a week"". ""We have to keep working as much as possible, but of course under strict sanitary conditions that stop the virus from spreading,"" he said, adding: ""Unemployment and poverty can also kill."" He later gave more details on what was permitted under the new rules, including going out for food shopping, going to work, going to a doctor or to a hospital or responding to a judicial or administrative summons. People are also allowed out for up to an hour for physical exercise or to take pets out - but only for a distance of 1km from their home. Ahead of All Saints Day on 1 November - an important day in France when families traditionally visit the graves of loved ones - the government said florists would be allowed to remain open until Sunday evening. Unlike the previous lockdown, markets, parks and gardens will be allowed to stay open. Sports halls and gyms are to close. Polandreported record daily infections and deaths on Thursday. Health officials said there were 20,156 new cases and 301 fatalities.The country has imposed a nationwide ""red zone"" lockdownthat includes the partial closure of primary schools and restaurants. Italy, which was the European epicentre at the start of the first wave of the virus, has already introduced new restrictions which will be in place for a month.  All bars and restaurants across the country have to close by 18:00, although they can provide takeaways later. Gyms, swimming pools, theatres and cinemas have to close, but museums can remain open. Gatherings for weddings, baptisms and funerals are banned. How the Czech Covid response went wrong Spainbegan its nationwide curfew on 25 October after the government declared a new state of emergency. People in all regions, with the exception of the Canary Islands, have to stay at home between 23:00 and 06:00. According tothe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external,the Czech Republichas the worst infection rate on the continent at 1,448 cases per 100,000 people over 14 days. It has imposed a partial lockdown. Belgium, which has Europe's second-worst infection rate per capita, has reported its highest number of hospital admissions for Covid-19 since a peak on 6 April. There are 5,924 patients in hospital with the virus, 993 of whom are in intensive care. In a national address on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo described the situations as ""critical"".

"An update to England and Wales' contact-tracing app is set to serve more self-isolation alerts. Gaby Appleton - who recently took over NHS Covid-19 - said this was being done to help tackle the spread of the coronavirus. The change coincides with a change to the app's algorithm to make its contact-matches more reliable. The Health Secretary previously voiced concern about people being told to stay at home because of false alerts. As a result, the app had required a higher risk score to be calculated before triggering a self-isolate command. The new director of product for Test and Trace said her team was so confident in the improvements made to distance estimates that it had moved the level at which notifications were triggered even lower than first planned. ""The update to the risk threshold is expected to increase the number of people asked to self-isolate by the app, having been in close contact with someone who tested positive,""Gaby Appleton blogged,external. ""We believe lowering the threshold is necessary to reduce the R rate and break the chain of transmission."" One risk is that if people start receiving more alerts they may become less willing to obey them. Privacy protections built into the software mean officials cannot see who it has told to self-isolate, and users cannot be fined for ignoring the app's guidance. Ms Appleton added that the app has proven to be more popular than any other European counterpart, despite having been one of the last to launch. She said more than 19 million people had downloaded it since 24 September, equating to about 40% of adults with access to a compatible smartphone. Officials believe the publicity campaign for the app had a good impact The BBC has learned that the Test and Trace team has gathered further data that indicates the app is out-performing other countries' efforts in terms of how many people have disclosed a positive test to trigger the automated contact-tracing process. However, it is not ready to publicly disclose the information at this time. Officials also declined to reveal whether they had logged the number of people who had uninstalled the app, which would give a better indication of the number of active users. Version 3.9 of NHS Covid-19 takes advantage of afiltering process called Unscented Kalman Smoother,external, to screen out suspect readings. The technique can be used for the first time as Apple and Google - which provide the underlying technology behind the app - have made it possible to scrutinise more of the Bluetooth data that is gathered to identify when two users are in close proximity. In simple terms, the app can now determine when the inferred distance between two handsets has rapidly fluctuated over a short timespan - for example being measured as being 2m, then 10m, then 3m, then 8m - within 15 minutes. This is not the way people normally interact with each other. However, such errant readings can be caused by Bluetooth signals bouncing off the metal fittings of a train, for example. The algorithm now takes this into account when calculating its risk score. Experts from the Alan Turing Institute - who have been helping improve the app - believe it is now close to, or perhaps even more accurate than, the original abandoned effort that did not rely on Apple and Google's framework. They believe further improvements can still be made. But the short-term consequence of the upgrade is that they believe the app will be able to confidently identify more high-risk cases, and thus trigger more notifications. That could prove controversial since users who are on low incomes can claim Â£500 from their local authority when ordered to self-isolate by a manual contact tracer, but there is no current way to get the payment if instructed to isolate by their handset. Covid-19 app users can't get isolation payment British apps plan to share data iPhone 12 launch causes NHS Covid-19 app confusion One other benefit of the upgrade is that it should end the problem of ""ghost notifications"", in which notifications popped up outside the app warning users they had been close to someone who had Covid-19, but the app itself did not recommend any action. From now on, users should only get such alerts for ""high-risk"" encounters that they need to act on. By one important measure, the number of downloads, the NHS Covid-19 app can be said to be a big success - even if it is hard to verify the claim that it's outpaced other European apps. The work done by experts from the Alan Turing Institute to improve the way it uses Bluetooth to measure one phone's proximity to another is also an impressive achievement, and one acknowledged by other technologists working in this field. But one question remains unanswered - does this or indeed any other contact-tracing app work in stopping the chain of infection? The anonymous nature of the Apple-Google toolkit, which is the foundation of the app, makes it hard to know much about how it is working. But the teams behind the Scottish and Northern Irish apps have released some data. The Scottish government says more than 10,000 people have been contacted via the Protect Scotland app to let them know they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app In Northern Ireland, more than 16,000 people have received notifications to self isolate after nearly 5,000 positive test results were entered into their app. The Department of Health says it wants to be absolutely sure that its data about the NHS Covid-19 app is accurate before releasing it. That is frustrating some on the app team, who say they have a good story to tell about the number of alerts being sent out. That number - whatever it is - will increase following the tweaking of the algorithms, which determine what is a risky contact. With reports from Ireland and Germany that their previously successful manual contact-tracing operations are struggling to cope, apps which automate the process may become more important. But a report in theTimes says no data is being collected from the manual,externalNHS Test and Trace service about how many people comply with orders to self-isolate. With a privacy-focused app such data will never be available - after all, if you don't even know the identity of the people receiving alerts you can hardly check up on them.

"A study by Imperial College London suggests nearly 100,000 people are catching Covid-19 every day in England The authors say current measures to curb infections are not sufficient and ""something has to change"" More than a dozen areas will move to England's ""high alert"" level, with its additional restrictions, from Saturday West Yorkshire will become the latest area to enter the top level of measures, joining tier three on Monday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set out Scotland's new five-tier Covid measures, but has not ruled out another national lockdown In Wales, the exams regulator is recommending GCSEs be scrapped in favour of assessments next summer The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and a further 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955 France and Germany are both reinstating some form of national lockdown, as Europe confronts a surge in cases and deaths Globally there have been more than 44.4 million coronavirus cases and more than 1.1 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay That's all from us today, thanks for joining our live coverage. Here's a recap of the day's top stories: The leader of Leeds City Council has said it was a ""very difficult decision""to move West Yorkshire into tier threeand a ""significant moment"" for Leeds and the region. Leeds City Council's chief executive Tom Riordan said a financial support package of Â£46.6m had been negotiated with the government for the region in addition to the tier two funding - with an further Â£12.7m for testing and tracing Casinos, car boot sales, adult gaming centres and soft-play areas will have to close under the new restrictions. Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals, said the number of Covid patients in hospitals had increased to 268 today - higher than in the first wave. An experimental drug that could prevent Covid-19 patients from becoming seriously ill is being trialled in England. The BBC's Fergus Walsh spoke to two volunteers who are taking part in the trial at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. This video can not be played Coronavirus treatment: Experimental drug in trial phase West Yorkshire is to become the latest area to join the top level of restrictions in England when it enters tier three at 00:01 GMT on Monday. Under tier three - also known as ""very high"" - restrictions, there can be no mixing of households indoors or ourdoors in private gardens. Pubs and bars that do not serve substantial food must close and people are advised to avoid travel out of the area. Overnight stays are banned and you cannot hold a wedding reception. In addition, casinos, soft play, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales must shut in West Yorkshire. Shisha cafes will not be allowed to serve shisha but may operate as cafe. Redcar could soon join tier three Local leaders in the Tees Valley area of the north-east of England say the government has informed them of its intention to put the region into tier three restrictions. A statement on behalf of the leaders of Redcar and Cleveland, Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool Councils, the mayor of Middlesbrough and the Tees Valley mayor, said further discussions would take place on Friday with nothing agreed as yet. Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council leader Mary Lanigan, speaking on behalf of he group, said: âThe government informed us late last night of their intention to take the Tees Valley into tier three restrictions. ""We have had an initial meeting with ministers this afternoon where they again stressed this intention due to the current infection rate and the increased number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19."" Nottinghamshire is expected to receive Â£23.1m in funding to support businesses and managing Covid-19 enforcement as it enters tier three restrictions. The funding will see a Â£16.5m business support scheme for firms in the county and Â£6.6m for managing systems like NHS test and trace locally. The figure excludes Nottingham city, which will receive its own funding. The news comes as the whole of the county enters the highest coronavirus restrictions in England on Friday. Under Nottinghamshire's tier three restrictions alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Deaths and hospital admissions related to coronavirus are continuing to rise across the UK, with the number of patients in hospital with Covid now around half of what it was at the peak in spring. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm People living in Stockholm and the Swedish regions of VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland and ÃstergÃ¶tland have been advised against going to gyms, museums, libraries, swimming pools and shopping centres until 19 November. They have also been told to avoid physical contact with people they do not live with. This follows similar restrictions introduced in the regions of Uppsala County and SkÃ¥ne last week, following an uptick of infections in these areas. All regions with tougher guidelines will keep the current limit of 50 people at public events. National guidelines are set to change on 1 November, allowing public gatherings of up to 300 people, as long as social distancing measures are in place. Social clubs in Lancashire say they are ""bitterly disappointed"" after the UK government closed an apparent loophole that allowed them to serve alcohol while in the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Under tier three rules,pubs and bars must closeunless they serve substantial meals. But some social clubs were continuing to serve alcohol without foodafter their local councils told them this was permitted. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde had all advised social clubs that the discrepancy existed because they held club premises certificates, rather than premises licences. But the government has since clarified that social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they also serve substantial meals. A club in Preston said its business would now ""slowly die"", although the treasurer of another club said the rule change was expected because someone had ""ticked the wrong box and not thought about us"".

It is part of Â£687m of Covid-19 funding from the Treasury in London. A further Â£100m has been redistributed by ministers between departments as part of the normal budgeting process. Hospices will get Â£7m, as well as Â£15m for sport and Â£25m for the taxi and coach industry, while councils are to get an extra Â£15m and the Department for Infrastructure is getting Â£10m. It was also confirmed by ministers that NI schools will reopen on Monday, with extra measures in place to allow pupils to return to classrooms safely. Read the full story here. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"" on Thursday afternoon A former MP in Northern Ireland and two other Sinn FÃ©in officials have resigned over a failure to return grants of Â£10,000 paid by a Stormont emergency Covid fund despite MP and MLA constituency offices being ineligible for the scheme. Three Sinn FÃ©in offices received the payments, which have since been repaid. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"", saying the grant was lodged into a joint account of which she is a named signature with her husband. ""I fully accept that as a named signature on the account that I should have taken extra steps to verify this situation before it was brought to my attention on Tuesday."" She has resigned as a senator in the Seanad (Irish Senate). Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald has accepted McCallion's resignation, as well as those of two other Sinn FÃ©in officials. She apologised for their ""failures"". Cyprus and Lithuania have been removed from England's travel corridor list, the Department for Transport has announced. That means, from this Sunday, people arriving from those countries will have to  self-isolate for two weeks. The decision comes after a rise in coronavirus cases in both countries. Lithuania's seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 people has reached 140, while Cyprus is on 112.

People are being urged not to travel into or out of council areas where there are level three restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people in hospital with Covid has risen to more than 10,000. This is half the level it was at the peak in spring and the highest number for nearly six months. It comes after a sustained rise in admissions since September. It means around one in 13 hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients. That may not sound a lot, but there are two things to remember. Firstly, hospital capacity has been affected by the need for social distancing and the segregation of wards, meaning not all beds can be used. Secondly, the admissions have not been evenly distributed. The north west of England is caring for nearly a quarter of the patients. That has left hospitals in places like Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool very close to capacity, although there are signs the rise in admissions may be levelling off. Pizza Express says it is cutting around 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after recent trading worsened due to tightened Covid restrictions. It comes two months after therestaurant chain revealed
plans to cut 1,100 roles and close 73 of its restaurants. No further restaurant sites will shut as a result of the latest cuts, it said. The chain said its city centre sites had been ""particularly hard-hit"" while some of its suburban and out-of-town locations had seen more resilient trading. Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director, said the chain's aim had been to keep staff and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible but the rise in coronavirus cases had caused footfall to decline across the UK and expected that to continue for ""some months"". The chain was doing ""what we can"" to support those affected, she said, adding that the cuts will ""give us more resilience through the next six months"" and enable it to continue serving customers in its restaurants and at home in the ""years ahead"". At least 175 people have tested positive for coronavirus at a meat processing factory in Norfolk. All 1,000 workers at Cranswick Country Foods in Watton are being tested after staff in the butchery section were found to have Covid-19. Breckland Council officials and NHS Test and Trace staff have been deployed to Watton for ""reassurance"". Four positive cases in the butchery department were confirmed on 15 October and testing was brought in five days later. Testing between 22 and 23 October found 175 cases. Norfolk's director of public health Dr Louise Smith said 350 workers had been tested so far. Read the full story here. The party included a hired marquee, DJ decks and live entertainers The organiser ofa christening party attended by up to 50 peoplehas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching Covid-19 rules. Some guests had travelled from London to the gathering in the Blakenhall area of Wolverhampton on Saturday, which included a hired marquee, DJ decks and live entertainers, West Midlands Police said. Wolverhampton is currently in tier two, with a ban on mixing indoors. Supt Simon Inglis said it was a ""reckless breach of Covid rules"" at a time when the virus was spreading. When police arrived at the home, the male organiser told them around 20 people were present but officers said they found more than 40 partygoers at the property. Told the party was a breach of Covid rules, the organiser told officers: ""Oh my god, I spent too much money on this party. Give me one hour."" The economy has reopened but full recovery remains out of reach, especially in cities such as New York The US economy emerged quickly from the depths of the crisis triggered by coronavirus lockdowns earlier this year, but full recovery remains out of reach, official figures show. The economy grew at a record 7.4% in the three months to 30 September from the previous quarter, when it suffered a severe decline. But output remained 2.9% lower compared to the same period a year ago and analysts warn the rebound may be running out of steam. ""Overall, the initial recovery in GDP after the first wave of lockdowns were lifted was stronger than we originally anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""But, with coronavirus infections hitting a record high in recent days and any additional fiscal stimulus unlikely to arrive until, at the earliest, the start of next year, further progress will be much slower.""

"This video can not be played JJ Williams: One of the most talented sportsmen Wales has produced Legendary Wales, British and Irish Lions and Llanelli wing JJ Williams has died at the age of 72. He scored 12 tries in 30 Tests as Wales won four Five Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, during the 1970s. A former sprinter who represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games, Williams also scored five tries in seven Tests for the Lions across two tours. He sparkled on their unbeaten tour of South Africa in 1974, scoring two tries in each of the second and third Tests. Obituary: JJ Williams Huge success with Wales followed, as Williams helped his country win the Five Nations Championship four times between 1975 and 1979. That included Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978 as Williams and his team-mates rubber-stamped their status as greats of not only Welsh rugby but the sport at large. After retiring, Williams made a name for himself as an outspoken pundit, co-commentating on international and club rugby for BBC Wales. Allow Twitter content?

Wales players will wear black armbands for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland. Wales head coach Wayne Pivac said: ""On behalf of the national squad, management and team, our thoughts and condolences go out to JJ's family and friends. ""It always is poignant when you have a player of that ilk passing away. We'll show our respects by wearing the black armbands. ""He's a well known figure and familiar face, you can't mistake him. He was around the place quite a lot. He was always a friendly face who would come and say hello. ""Personally, he was very good to have rugby conversations with. He'll be sadly missed and the guys are well aware of what he's achieved in the game."" The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) offered its condolences, saying: ""All our thoughts are with JJ's family and friends at this sad time."" Williams' former Wales and Lions team-mate, scrum-half legend Sir Gareth Edwards, said: ""A lot of people thought that JJ Williams was just a sprinter and out and out runner, but he had far more than that. ""Having been the outside-half for the Welsh schoolboys he had the ability to read the game and the knack to be in the right place at the right time. ""I spent many an our preparing for international matches and loathe to say training with him because I used to pull his leg quite often and say when we were half way through a session 'that's enough John, I'm ready'.

""He'd say 'oh, no no we're not' - typical athlete; wanted more, wanted to give more. ""But I was fortunate to be in a Welsh side when we had some very capable players and John epitomised the mood of that time. ""We had Gerald Davies on one wing as elusive as anybody, as slippery as an eel and JJ, an out-and-out sprinter, but very, very talented and capable of turning games in a moment. ""And indeed [I was lucky] to have toured with the British and Irish Lions with him. ""So over the years I've been very fortunate to sit back and admire his talents."" Edwards' former Wales and Lions half-back partner - another legend of the game - Phil Bennett played alongside Williams for Llanelli. ""I've had so many colleagues and old friends and rugby players phoning me; some of the great names from the past and everybody devastated by the news that JJ has gone and left us,"" said Bennett. ""A wonderful rugby player, great friend andâ¦ it only seemed like yesterday he was tearing up South Africa, ripping them apart and scoring tries for fun - a truly remarkable player. ""I can remember him joining Llanelli in 1972 and it was our centenary year and the great Carwyn James was coaching and we had a few star players come in - Tommy David, Chico Hopkins - and he said 'I've got the one man I wanted to join us, JJ Williams. He's a flier on the wing, we've got a good back division, let's get him the ball and he'll score the tries for us'. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""But he went on to play nine seasons for my beloved Scarlets; 223 games, didn't pull out of the hard cup games away to Pontypool and Neath etc and he endeared himself to the fans who loved him down here and, indeed, loved him all over Wales and it's very sad for John and his family, who worshipped him."" Williams played for Llanelli when they famously beat New Zealand 9-3 at Stradey Park in 1972. The club said: ""It is with great sadness that we hear of the passing of the great JJ Williams.

"Hornby is best known for its model railways Model railway maker Hornby has seen its sales surge by 33% in the six months to the end of September, as more people took up hobbies in lockdown. The firm, which also makes Corgi cars and Scalextric racing kits, said it had benefitted from families spending more time at home. Not along ago, Hornby was ""a company in chaos"", losing up to Â£10m a year, according to boss Lyndon Davies. He hailed the firm's return to profit in a ""time of adversity"". ""We have observed hitherto successful and profitable companies worldwide crumbling under the pressure [of the pandemic], with losses, closures and tumbling share values. ""Yet we have not only weathered this shattering storm, our sales have increased by 33% in the first half of 2020, moving Hornby back into profitability."" The 'chaos' that nearly derailed Hornby Parts of the Hornby business that performed strongly over the past six months included Airfix, its model aeroplane brand, and Humbrol, which makes specialist paints for modelling. Mr Davies said the company had seen a big jump in online sales, as customers sought comfort from uncertainty in products ""they know and love"". He said boredom was another driver: ""People want to do things, they don't want to sit there watching the TV for the day."" Hornby also makes Scalextric racing sets He said the firm entered the year with ""no idea"" how the business would be impacted by the pandemic. All of the firm's offices had to close at various points, and it lost several weeks of shipments due to supply chain issues. Despite this, sales climbed to Â£21.1m in the period from Â£15.9m last year. That's given Hornby a net profit of Â£200,000, turning around a Â£2.5m loss in 2019. Shares in the firm surged almost 30% on the back of the strong results. Lockdown isn't the only reason behind Hornby's changing fortunes. After a complete restructuring of the management team in 2017, the company widened its range, introducing train sets tied to well-known brands such as Harry Potter and Paddington Bear. Back to the Future-themed cars have been ""the biggest selling Scalextric cars for 10 years"", Mr Davies added. The firm has also embraced new technologies. A century after its first clockwork locomotive was introduced in 1920, the company's model trains and racing cars can now be controlled by mobile phone apps using bluetooth. ""These brands have been misunderstood for the past 5-10 years, but in the last year we've brought them alive again,"" Mr Davies said.

"This video can not be played JJ Williams: One of the most talented sportsmen Wales has produced Legendary Wales, British and Irish Lions and Llanelli wing JJ Williams has died at the age of 72. He scored 12 tries in 30 Tests as Wales won four Five Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, during the 1970s. A former sprinter who represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games, Williams also scored five tries in seven Tests for the Lions across two tours. He sparkled on their unbeaten tour of South Africa in 1974, scoring two tries in each of the second and third Tests. Obituary: JJ Williams Huge success with Wales followed, as Williams helped his country win the Five Nations Championship four times between 1975 and 1979. That included Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978 as Williams and his team-mates rubber-stamped their status as greats of not only Welsh rugby but the sport at large. After retiring, Williams made a name for himself as an outspoken pundit, co-commentating on international and club rugby for BBC Wales. Allow Twitter content?

Wales players will wear black armbands for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland. Wales head coach Wayne Pivac said: ""On behalf of the national squad, management and team, our thoughts and condolences go out to JJ's family and friends. ""It always is poignant when you have a player of that ilk passing away. We'll show our respects by wearing the black armbands. ""He's a well known figure and familiar face, you can't mistake him. He was around the place quite a lot. He was always a friendly face who would come and say hello. ""Personally, he was very good to have rugby conversations with. He'll be sadly missed and the guys are well aware of what he's achieved in the game."" The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) offered its condolences, saying: ""All our thoughts are with JJ's family and friends at this sad time."" Williams' former Wales and Lions team-mate, scrum-half legend Sir Gareth Edwards, said: ""A lot of people thought that JJ Williams was just a sprinter and out and out runner, but he had far more than that. ""Having been the outside-half for the Welsh schoolboys he had the ability to read the game and the knack to be in the right place at the right time. ""I spent many an our preparing for international matches and loathe to say training with him because I used to pull his leg quite often and say when we were half way through a session 'that's enough John, I'm ready'.

""He'd say 'oh, no no we're not' - typical athlete; wanted more, wanted to give more. ""But I was fortunate to be in a Welsh side when we had some very capable players and John epitomised the mood of that time. ""We had Gerald Davies on one wing as elusive as anybody, as slippery as an eel and JJ, an out-and-out sprinter, but very, very talented and capable of turning games in a moment. ""And indeed [I was lucky] to have toured with the British and Irish Lions with him. ""So over the years I've been very fortunate to sit back and admire his talents."" Edwards' former Wales and Lions half-back partner - another legend of the game - Phil Bennett played alongside Williams for Llanelli. ""I've had so many colleagues and old friends and rugby players phoning me; some of the great names from the past and everybody devastated by the news that JJ has gone and left us,"" said Bennett. ""A wonderful rugby player, great friend andâ¦ it only seemed like yesterday he was tearing up South Africa, ripping them apart and scoring tries for fun - a truly remarkable player. ""I can remember him joining Llanelli in 1972 and it was our centenary year and the great Carwyn James was coaching and we had a few star players come in - Tommy David, Chico Hopkins - and he said 'I've got the one man I wanted to join us, JJ Williams. He's a flier on the wing, we've got a good back division, let's get him the ball and he'll score the tries for us'. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""What took him to my heart, when he joined Llanelli I though 'hang on, is he coming here because it's our centenary year - is he just coming here to join a club that's celebrating things?' ""But he went on to play nine seasons for my beloved Scarlets; 223 games, didn't pull out of the hard cup games away to Pontypool and Neath etc and he endeared himself to the fans who loved him down here and, indeed, loved him all over Wales and it's very sad for John and his family, who worshipped him."" Williams played for Llanelli when they famously beat New Zealand 9-3 at Stradey Park in 1972. The club said: ""It is with great sadness that we hear of the passing of the great JJ Williams. ""We would like to extend our sincerest condolences to his family, friends and former team-mates."" One of Williams' former clubs, Bridgend, tweeted on Thursday morning: ""All at Bridgend Ravens are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of former player JJ Williams. ""Our thoughts are with JJ's family and friends at this tough time."" Former Wales second row Craig Quinnell, Williams' godson, was another to pay tribute, tweeting: ""It's with a heavy heart I write this. My godfather. My friend.

"This video can not be played In comments before his suspension from Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism complaints numbers were ""exaggerated"" Labour has suspended Jeremy Corbyn from the party over his reaction to a highly critical report on anti-Semitism. The human rights watchdog found Labour responsible for ""unlawful"" harassment and discrimination during Mr Corbyn's four-and-a-half years as leader. But he later said the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated"" by opponents. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn was being suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Mr Corbyn reacted by calling the move ""political"" and promised to ""strongly contest"" it. The suspension will remain in place while the party carries out an investigation into his remarks. What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour's agony over anti-Semitism far from over Sir Keir Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, said the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's (EHRC) report had brought ""a day of shame"" for the party. It found Labour responsible forthree breaches of the Equality Act:,external Political interference in anti-Semitism complaints Failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints Harassment, including the use of anti-Semitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of anti-Semitism were fake or smears The EHRC found evidence of 23 instances of ""inappropriate involvement"" by Mr Corbyn's office. Sir Keir, who served under Mr Corbyn as shadow Brexit secretary, promised to implement the report's recommendations ""as soon as possible in the New Year"". This seems not to have been a deliberately designed collision between the current party boss and his predecessor. But this was an explosive political parting of ways, provoked in part by Mr Corbyn's trademark determination not to bend. This is an attribute admired by many of his devotees, a frustration abhorred by his detractors and a sadness to those in Labour who believe it coloured the party's handling of anti-Semitism. For Sir Keir, this episode does, perhaps by accident rather than design, prove beyond doubt his slogan - Labour is under new leadership - to be true. Read Laura's blog Responding to the EHRC's findings, Mr Corbyn said he was ""always determined to eliminate all forms of racism"". He claimed his team had ""acted to speed up, not hinder the process"" and that the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party"". Shortly afterwards Labour general secretary David Evans suspended Mr Corbyn. The party said this was ""in light of his comments"" and ""his failure to retract them subsequently"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer ""disappointed"" with Corbyn's response Mr Corbyn, Labour leader from 2015 until this year, reacted on Twitter, promising to ""strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me"". He said those who denied the party had an anti-Semitism problem were ""wrong"" and he would ""continue to support a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of racism"". In an interview, Mr Corbyn did not retract his earlier comments and said: ""I'll be appealing to the party and those who made the decision to kindly think again."" 10:00 GMTThe EHRC releases its report saying Labour acted unlawfully over anti-Semitism 10:36Jeremy Corbyn says there was an anti-Semitism problem in the party, but it was ""dramatically overstated"" 11:07Sir Keir Starmer says those who think anti-Semitism is ""exaggerated or a factional attack"" are ""part of the problem"" 11:15Sir Keir is repeatedly asked if he will expel Mr Corbyn for ""exaggerated"" comments - he says the report did not name individuals and repeats his previous statement 12:15Mr Corbyn records an interview, to be released at 13:00, disagreeing with a number of the report's points and repeating that the number of anti-Semitism cases is ""exaggerated"" 13:06Labour announces it has suspended Mr Corbyn Sir Keir defended the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn, saying: ""We cannot say 'zero tolerance' and then turn a blind eye."" He added: ""I was very disappointed in Jeremy Corbyn's statement and appropriate action has been taken, which I fully support."" Sir Keir said would not ""interfere"" with the party's internal investigation into Mr Corbyn's statement. Labour has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since 2016, with a number of MPs quitting the party in protest while Mr Corbyn was leader. Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: ""[The suspension] is the right decision following Corbyn's shameful reaction to the EHRC report."" The party was ""finally saying enough is enough, anti-Semitism can never be tolerated"", she added. This video can not be played Speaking before he was suspended, Ex-Labour MP Luciana Berger accuses Mr Corbyn of anti-Semitism Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Jeremy is a thoroughly decent man, but he has an absolute blind spot and a denial when it comes to some of these issues."" But groups on the left of the Labour movement attacked the decision to suspend him. The Socialist Campaign Group said it ""firmly"" opposed the move, adding: ""We will work tirelessly for his reinstatement."" And Momentum, among Mr Corbyn's strongest backers, said: ""It is a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity."" For the Conservatives, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has written to Sir Keir, saying he ""seemingly found it much harder to find the moral character and backbone to do what was right"" while serving in the shadow cabinet under Mr Corbyn. The EHRC launched its investigation last year after receiving a number of complaints from organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism and the Jewish Labour Movement.

"Taxi drivers say their businesses have been severely disrupted by the pandemic Financial support for taxi drivers and coach and bus operators affected by Covid-19 restrictions has been approved by the executive. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said a Â£14m package would go directly to taxi drivers. She confirmed it would be a one-off cash payment of Â£1,500 to each taxi driver. Some drivers havecriticised this amount, describing it as ""a go-away payment"". They said this would not go far enough to cover lost earnings during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ms Mallon said she did not agree it was a ""go-away payment"". ""I've been very honest with people, as the minister for infrastructure I don't have the power to create schemes,"" she said. ""I was given these powers at the weekend, I've delivered a scheme to the executive today and I'm clearly saying I want it up and running as quickly as possible"". She said she recognised taxi drivers were struggling and she was doing what she could in difficult circumstances. She said her intention was to open the online application process on 9 November. Coach and bus operators will get a bespoke financial scheme worth a total of Â£5m that will be based on the number of buses in a firm's fleet. She said it would be capped at up to Â£100,000 for each operator. Speaking before the Â£14m package was confirmed, taxi driver Pat Meghan told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster a Â£1,500 one-off payment was ""very disappointing"". ""We've went through this process for the last seven months of talking to this department and trying to get somebody to take ownership of us and, finally on Tuesday, Nichola Mallon broke this big news to us that she's putting a bespoke scheme in place,"" he said. Taxi drivers welcome financial support package plans Support for taxi, coach and bus firms 'brought forward' Mr Meghan said some drivers have cars worth Â£52,000, which incur high monthly costs. ""Â£1,500 for the last seven months - we don't know what we're looking into in the future. Is it a payment to get us to go away?"" ""Our night time economy has gone, there's nothing out there, there's no one in the city centre, no offices,"" said Mr Meghan. ""We're down to 10-15% of the work we used to have. ""I haven't been out of the house this last fortnight, I haven't taken the car out because it costs money, money that I don't have to put fuel in my car.""

"Finance Minister Conor Murphy has announced a package worth Â£560m to help NI's health service tackle Covid-19. It is part of Â£687m of Covid-19 funding from the Treasury in London. A further Â£100m has been redistributed by ministers between departments as part of the normal budgeting process. Hospices will get Â£7m, as well as Â£15m for sport and Â£25m for the taxi and coach industry, while councils are to get an extra Â£15m and the Department for Infrastructure is getting Â£10m. It was also confirmed by ministers that NI schools will reopen on Monday, with extra measures in place to allow pupils to return to classrooms safely. That will include the mandatory wearing of face coverings for post-primary pupils on school transport. Schools closed on 19 October as part of tighter Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the NI Executive. Speaking at Stormont's press briefing on Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said it is ""the activity and mingling outside school gates that is of particular concern"", not what occurs within classroom settings. ""Messaging will be rolled out in the coming days,"" she added. On Thursday, ministers also discussed the effect of the latest restrictions on transmission rates in Northern Ireland. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported eight further Covid-19 related deaths on Thursday, bringing its total to 688. There were 822 further positive cases, with the total number of cases now 37,216. The Republic of Ireland reported six further Covid-related deaths and 866 new cases on Thursday. There are 43 people in ICU, an increase of two from Wednesday. There are now 330 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals in the country. The first minister said NI's R-rate - or reproduction rate - for case numbers had dropped below one for the first time since the early summer. ""There are green shoots of hope"", she added. Mrs Foster also said about 4,500 staff in the health service are off work on sick leave. She said 1,100 of those absences were Covid-related. The rest were ""standard sickness for this time of year,"" she added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said everyone in Northern Ireland ""needs to keep at this and do our part to stop this virus spreading"". She said the recent decrease in transmission of the virus in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area, which previously had the highest rate across the UK, was down to efforts of the public. Mr Murphy said some of the extra health money will be spent on enhancing the test, trace and isolate systems. He said there was also an extra Â£61m to meet increased education pressures. ""This covers costs with restarting schools including; funding to provide a safe learning environment for children and young people, staff costs, free school meals and uniform grants. ""This also includes, nearly Â£12 million for Education Authority pressures including special educational needs."" Mr Murphy said the Â£15m for sport was to help organisations which have lost income as a result of reduced spectators at their events, club membership and running competitions. Ministers have also approved extra financial support for taxi drivers and coach operators affected during the pandemic. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said a Â£14m package would go directly to taxi drivers. Some drivers havecriticised reports they will each be offereda one-off payment of Â£1,500. Coach and bus operators will receive a package worth Â£5m.

"North and South Lanarkshire could have the toughest restrictions imposed - although the first minister has said she hopes this will not be the case The levels of coronavirus restrictions to be placed on each of Scotland's 32 local council areas are to be confirmed later. Provisional tierspublished earlier this weeksuggested North and South Lanarkshire could both be placed in the highest level four category. If that recommendation is confirmed, it would impose restrictions close to full lockdown on the two council areas. Much of the rest of the country will be placed in either level two or three. But rural areas including the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and Moray, which have far fewer cases of the virus, are likely to be moved down to level one. What level might your area be heading into? How are the Covid restriction levels decided? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? This could eventually allow groups of up to six people from two households to meet in each other's homes again - although it will not happen immediately as an ""extra precaution"" while the country transitions to the new system. People will still be banned from meeting in other homes in levels two, three and four. But the aim is for schools across the country to remain open, even in any areas that have the strictest restrictions imposed. Full details of the new five-tier system - which will also have a ""level zero"" at the bottom that will allow life to return almost to normal - will be outlined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at about 12:20 GMT. The new rules will come into force from Monday. The Scottish government hasalready published the ""indicators""it will use when deciding which of the five levels of Covid restrictions each local authority area will be put into, which include levels of infection and transmission as well as hospital capacity. It is expected that most of the central belt - which includes Glasgow and Edinburgh and already has tighter restrictions than the rest of the country - will be placed in level three, as could Dundee. The exceptions could be North and South Lanarkshire, which may go into the highest level four category due to concerns about their high number of cases and hospital admissions - although Ms Sturgeon has stressed that this will not necessarily happen. If the area is placed in level four, bars and restaurants would remain closed while non-essential shops would also have to shut, along with hairdressers, gyms, libraries and visitor attractions. Ms Sturgeon will make the announcement in the Scottish Parliament ahead of first minister's questions The leaders of both councils have warned that the move would have a ""catastrophic"" impact on local businesses were it to happen, and argued that level three would be more appropriate. In a joint letter, which was also signed by local NHS and police chiefs, they said that there was ""emerging clear evidence in Lanarkshire that the very steep rise has been halted and that there is an indication that cases are falling to some extent"". Placing Lanarkshire in Level 4 would have ""considerable implications"" for the area and beyond, they warned, with ""significant impacts on health and wellbeing, public services, and business and the economy"". Their letter added: ""We are very concerned that businesses - who, as noted, have already complied with all the regulation and guidance in place - will suffer potentially catastrophic impacts."" They also accused the Scottish government of being ""silent"" on whether additional financial support would be put in place for businesses that were required to close by level four restrictions. Ms Sturgeon said on Wednesday that she did not want to put any part of the country under the most severe restrictions unless it was ""absolutely necessary"". And she said that she ""very much hoped"" that she would not be putting Lanarkshire into level four. Pubs and restaurants across much of the central belt are likely to be allowed to reopen - but will not be able to serve alcohol Bars and restaurants across Scotland's central belthad to close on 9 Octoberas part of a ""short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infections"", while tight restrictions were placed on those in the rest of the country. The new system will allow pubs and restaurants in level two areas to serve alcohol indoors again - but only with a meal and until 20:00. In level three areas they can reopen until 18:00 but cannot serve alcohol, while at level four they will remain closed. Industry leaders have said that the slight easing of the restrictions on licensed premises does not go far enough, and would do little to improve the chances of businesses surviving. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said it would do ""nothing at all to relive the worries, tension and anger that is felt by hospitality businesses and staff throughout the country."" He also argued that ""a couple of opening hours here and there under the new system will make no difference"" to the vast majority of businesses. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce have said there was a ""clear lack of evidence"" for continuing to impose such tight restrictions on the hospitality sector.

"Janette Ritson says she is recovering well after the surgery to remove a sarcoma tumour Warning: An image from the procedure appears in this report A cancer patient is recovering after part of her leg was removed and transported to a different hospital for radiation treatment. Janette Ritson remained at the NHS Golden Jubilee in Clydebank when her left tibia (shin bone) was sent on a 20-minute journey to Glasgow. It was treated with radiation at the Beatson Cancer Centre before being returned to Clydebank and reattached. Doctors say the procedure saved Janette from having her leg amputated. The whole procedure took about 12 hours. Surgery of this kind would normally have been performed at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. But the sarcoma service was transferred to the Golden Jubilee in April to ensure continuity during the Covid pandemic. The procedure took about 12 hours Janette Ritson, 71, said she has had cancer diagnoses twice in the past and knew ""something needed to be done"". ""It was a little bit daunting, I have to say, knowing that if the operation hadn't worked out that it would mean an amputation,"" she said. ""That really worried me, but I got my head round it and accepted that's what it was going to be. ""It's absolutely mind-blowing what they have achieved."" Janette added: ""Everything is healing well and going according to plan. ""Before the operation I hadn't been able to do much like gardening or anything so just getting back to normal life and not being wheeled about in a chair would be just magic."" Janette's surgery was led by consultant orthopaedic surgeon Ashish Mahendra. The affected bone was driven 20 miles to be treated with radiation before being re-attached Mr Mahendra said: ""This really was one big team effort by everyone involved and we could not have done this without the teamwork and collaboration when the sarcoma service transferred over to the Golden Jubilee. ""The patient is doing really well so far and is very grateful the cancer is out. She is healing well but has a long road ahead and remains under regular follow-up."" Golden Jubilee director of national elective services Claire MacArthur said: ""We have been collaborating with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde since April 2020 to support the continuation of surgery for cancer patients who require urgent treatment during the pandemic. ""A major benefit for both the patients and the service is that the Golden Jubilee has dedicated clinical capacity and has developed green patient pathways to support the continuation of urgent and life critical surgery, minimising risk for cancer patients and minimising delays to their surgery."" She said everyone involved deserved ""immense credit"". ""The professionalism and collaboration shown by all staff from both health boards is exceptional and is an exemplary example of first class person-centred care,"" she added.

"An update to England and Wales' contact-tracing app is set to serve more self-isolation alerts. Gaby Appleton - who recently took over NHS Covid-19 - said this was being done to help tackle the spread of the coronavirus. The change coincides with a change to the app's algorithm to make its contact-matches more reliable. The Health Secretary previously voiced concern about people being told to stay at home because of false alerts. As a result, the app had required a higher risk score to be calculated before triggering a self-isolate command. The new director of product for Test and Trace said her team was so confident in the improvements made to distance estimates that it had moved the level at which notifications were triggered even lower than first planned. ""The update to the risk threshold is expected to increase the number of people asked to self-isolate by the app, having been in close contact with someone who tested positive,""Gaby Appleton blogged,external. ""We believe lowering the threshold is necessary to reduce the R rate and break the chain of transmission."" One risk is that if people start receiving more alerts they may become less willing to obey them. Privacy protections built into the software mean officials cannot see who it has told to self-isolate, and users cannot be fined for ignoring the app's guidance. Ms Appleton added that the app has proven to be more popular than any other European counterpart, despite having been one of the last to launch. She said more than 19 million people had downloaded it since 24 September, equating to about 40% of adults with access to a compatible smartphone. Officials believe the publicity campaign for the app had a good impact The BBC has learned that the Test and Trace team has gathered further data that indicates the app is out-performing other countries' efforts in terms of how many people have disclosed a positive test to trigger the automated contact-tracing process. However, it is not ready to publicly disclose the information at this time. Officials also declined to reveal whether they had logged the number of people who had uninstalled the app, which would give a better indication of the number of active users. Version 3.9 of NHS Covid-19 takes advantage of afiltering process called Unscented Kalman Smoother,external, to screen out suspect readings. The technique can be used for the first time as Apple and Google - which provide the underlying technology behind the app - have made it possible to scrutinise more of the Bluetooth data that is gathered to identify when two users are in close proximity. In simple terms, the app can now determine when the inferred distance between two handsets has rapidly fluctuated over a short timespan - for example being measured as being 2m, then 10m, then 3m, then 8m - within 15 minutes. This is not the way people normally interact with each other. However, such errant readings can be caused by Bluetooth signals bouncing off the metal fittings of a train, for example. The algorithm now takes this into account when calculating its risk score. Experts from the Alan Turing Institute - who have been helping improve the app - believe it is now close to, or perhaps even more accurate than, the original abandoned effort that did not rely on Apple and Google's framework. They believe further improvements can still be made. But the short-term consequence of the upgrade is that they believe the app will be able to confidently identify more high-risk cases, and thus trigger more notifications. That could prove controversial since users who are on low incomes can claim Â£500 from their local authority when ordered to self-isolate by a manual contact tracer, but there is no current way to get the payment if instructed to isolate by their handset. Covid-19 app users can't get isolation payment British apps plan to share data iPhone 12 launch causes NHS Covid-19 app confusion One other benefit of the upgrade is that it should end the problem of ""ghost notifications"", in which notifications popped up outside the app warning users they had been close to someone who had Covid-19, but the app itself did not recommend any action. From now on, users should only get such alerts for ""high-risk"" encounters that they need to act on. By one important measure, the number of downloads, the NHS Covid-19 app can be said to be a big success - even if it is hard to verify the claim that it's outpaced other European apps. The work done by experts from the Alan Turing Institute to improve the way it uses Bluetooth to measure one phone's proximity to another is also an impressive achievement, and one acknowledged by other technologists working in this field. But one question remains unanswered - does this or indeed any other contact-tracing app work in stopping the chain of infection? The anonymous nature of the Apple-Google toolkit, which is the foundation of the app, makes it hard to know much about how it is working. But the teams behind the Scottish and Northern Irish apps have released some data. The Scottish government says more than 10,000 people have been contacted via the Protect Scotland app to let them know they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.

That is frustrating some on the app team, who say they have a good story to tell about the number of alerts being sent out.

"Social contacts in Germany will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of a long, hard winter ahead as she defended the reinstatement of a national lockdown. Mrs Merkel was heckled by right-wing MPs as she outlined the new measures in parliament. Rising coronavirus infections and deaths are triggering tougher restrictions across Europe. France restores a lockdown on Friday, ordering people to stay at home except for essential work or medical reasons. President Emmanuel Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Daily Covid deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Thursday, authorities reported 47,637 new cases compared to 36,437 a day earlier and 235 new deaths, nine fewer than on Wednesday. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? German health officials said on Thursday that another 89 people had died in the past 24 hours, with a record 16,774 infections. Germany's new measures, which come into force on Monday, are not as far-reaching as in France, but they include the closure of restaurants, bars, gyms and theatres, Mrs Merkel said. The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and an additional 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955. In England,a new study shows almost 100,000 people are catching the virus every day, putting pressure on the government to change policy from a regional approach. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the continent was ""deep in the second wave"". ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas,"" she said. This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November The first wave of the virus earlier this year hit some parts of Europe incredibly hard, while other areas were able to escape the worst. President Macron warned the second wave ""no doubt will be harder than the first"" Italy, Spain, France and the UK were among the worst-hit nations, with all imposing strict national lockdowns that over time brought cases, hospital admissions and deaths down to a very low level but ravaged economies. Restrictions started to lift in the early summer, with non-essential shops, bars and restaurants reopening, and travel restarting. But in August cases began to rise again, with a major acceleration in recent weeks that has alarmed policymakers. Countries that were not hit badly by the first wave - such as the Czech Republic and Poland - have not been spared this time, with experts warning of alarming infection rates across much of the continent. Addressing parliament on Thursday Mrs Merkel said that ""winter will be hard - four long, difficult months - but it will come to an end"". ""This pandemic brings the question of freedom to the fore. Freedom is not 'every man for himself', it is responsibility - for oneself, one's family, the workplace. It shows us we are part of a whole,"" she said. During her speech, Mrs Merkel was heckled by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party who oppose the restrictions. Leader Alexander Gauland accused the government of ""corona dictatorship"". In response, Mrs Merkel warned that disinformation and conspiracy theories undermined the fight against the pandemic. The AfD has staged protests against the government's coronavirus measures Germany, like other countries,has seen protests by people claiming restrictions are unwarranted. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed the government. Germany's partial lockdown will last until 30 November under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers. Bars and restaurants will close except for takeaway, but schools and kindergartens will remain open. Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted. In terms of economic help, smaller companies and the self-employed badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty Meanwhile in France, Mr Macron said that under the new rules, people would need to fill in a form to justify leaving their homes, as had been required in the initial lockdown in March. Social gatherings are banned. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". ""Like all our neighbours, we are submerged by the sudden acceleration of the virus,"" said Mr Macron. Prime Minister Jean Castex told parliament on Thursday that all students aged six and over would have to wear face masks in class ""to protect all our children, teachers and parents"".

"Social contacts in Germany will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of a long, hard winter ahead as she defended the reinstatement of a national lockdown. Mrs Merkel was heckled by right-wing MPs as she outlined the new measures in parliament. Rising coronavirus infections and deaths are triggering tougher restrictions across Europe. France restores a lockdown on Friday, ordering people to stay at home except for essential work or medical reasons. President Emmanuel Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Daily Covid deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Thursday, authorities reported 47,637 new cases compared to 36,437 a day earlier and 235 new deaths, nine fewer than on Wednesday. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? German health officials said on Thursday that another 89 people had died in the past 24 hours, with a record 16,774 infections. Germany's new measures, which come into force on Monday, are not as far-reaching as in France, but they include the closure of restaurants, bars, gyms and theatres, Mrs Merkel said. The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and an additional 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955. In England,a new study shows almost 100,000 people are catching the virus every day, putting pressure on the government to change policy from a regional approach. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the continent was ""deep in the second wave"". ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas,"" she said. This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November The first wave of the virus earlier this year hit some parts of Europe incredibly hard, while other areas were able to escape the worst. President Macron warned the second wave ""no doubt will be harder than the first"" Italy, Spain, France and the UK were among the worst-hit nations, with all imposing strict national lockdowns that over time brought cases, hospital admissions and deaths down to a very low level but ravaged economies. Restrictions started to lift in the early summer, with non-essential shops, bars and restaurants reopening, and travel restarting. But in August cases began to rise again, with a major acceleration in recent weeks that has alarmed policymakers. Countries that were not hit badly by the first wave - such as the Czech Republic and Poland - have not been spared this time, with experts warning of alarming infection rates across much of the continent. Addressing parliament on Thursday Mrs Merkel said that ""winter will be hard - four long, difficult months - but it will come to an end"". ""This pandemic brings the question of freedom to the fore. Freedom is not 'every man for himself', it is responsibility - for oneself, one's family, the workplace. It shows us we are part of a whole,"" she said. During her speech, Mrs Merkel was heckled by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party who oppose the restrictions. Leader Alexander Gauland accused the government of ""corona dictatorship"". In response, Mrs Merkel warned that disinformation and conspiracy theories undermined the fight against the pandemic. The AfD has staged protests against the government's coronavirus measures Germany, like other countries,has seen protests by people claiming restrictions are unwarranted. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed the government. Germany's partial lockdown will last until 30 November under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers. Bars and restaurants will close except for takeaway, but schools and kindergartens will remain open. Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted. In terms of economic help, smaller companies and the self-employed badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty Meanwhile in France, Mr Macron said that under the new rules, people would need to fill in a form to justify leaving their homes, as had been required in the initial lockdown in March. Social gatherings are banned. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". ""Like all our neighbours, we are submerged by the sudden acceleration of the virus,"" said Mr Macron. Prime Minister Jean Castex told parliament on Thursday that all students aged six and over would have to wear face masks in class ""to protect all our children, teachers and parents"". Until now masks have only been mandatory for students aged 11 and older. Jean Castex said greater effort was needed to stop the spread of the coronavirus He said companies would be strongly urged to have their employees work from home ""five days a week"".

"First since the 1960s to open with degree awarding powers already in place A new higher education institution is opening in London next autumn which will not teach traditional separate subjects - but will be able to award its own degrees. The London Interdisciplinary School is opening in Whitechapel, east London. It is claimed as the first institution since the 1960s to start from scratch with full UK degree awarding powers. The private college will be partly owned by the UK government, which is part-funding the project. Students will all take a combined arts and science course aimed at teaching problem-solving skills. Rather than offering conventional degree subjects, such as history or physics, there will be a single three-year degree course focusing on global issues, such as climate change, with the aim of ""cutting across disciplines"". The London Interdisciplinary School (LIS), which will have 100 students in its first cohort paying Â£9,000 per year, is claimed as the first entirely new provider for a generation that will be able to issue its own degrees from the outset. The new institution will move straight to being able to award its own degrees when it opens This is expected to be formally announced later this week. Other new institutions have gained degree awarding powers after a number of years and transitions in status. For instance the Dyson Institute set up in 2017 will get degree awarding powers from next year. Ed Fidoe, one of the founders, says the idea of the new institution is to provide something different, rather than replicate the traditional model of university education. ""It has to be genuinely different, or otherwise what's the point?"" says Mr Fidoe, who previously helped to set up the School 21 free school in east London. Dyson Institute to tackle skills shortages England's education secretary against 50% university target The 'taboo' about who doesn't go to university There will be no specific A-level requirements for entry. Instead, applicants would be interviewed to see if they would be suitable for a course that would cut across different subject areas, and have strong links with employers. Mr Fidoe believes that an approach based on tackling real-world problems will be more engaging for students - and will produce graduates who will be attractive to employers. He says there has been a ""paradox"" in higher education, that universities produce highly innovative research, but there has been much less change in what they offer and how they teach students. Mary Curnock Cook, former head of the Ucas admissions service, said that the experiment with crossing disciplines and subject areas would be a ""superb and rigorous innovation"". Government financial backing is from the Future Fund, supported by the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which has offered matched funding to support ventures during the Covid pandemic. Along with Mr Fidoe, the LIS is being founded by academic Carl Gombrich and online entrepreneur Chris Persson. The new college is aiming to become a fully-fledged university, with a university title, in the next few years.

"President Trump mocked mask-wearing mandates at a rally in Arizona on Wednesday President Donald Trump has urged states to shun lockdowns as his Democratic rival Joe Biden said the pandemic could not be stopped by ""flipping a switch"". Continuing a whirlwind schedule of rallies in battleground states, Mr Trump also mocked mask mandates. Mr Biden said Mr Trump's handling of America's worsening coronavirus crisis was an ""insult"" to its victims. The Democrat has a solid national lead over the Republican president six days before the 3 November election. But Mr Biden's advantage is narrower in the handful of US states that could vote either way and ultimately decide who wins the White House. This video can not be played ""Well, we just voted"": Joe Biden has cast his ballot early in Delaware More than 75 million Americans have voted early, nearly 50 million of them by post, in a record-breaking voting surge driven by the pandemic. Virus deaths are rising in 39 US states and an average of about 800 people are dying daily nationwide. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? A really simple guide to the US election The other US election that's hugely important White House coronavirus task force expert Dr Anthony Fauci told the BBC on Wednesday that Mr Trump's political rallies were bound to spread Covid-19. He said gatherings of people not wearing masks or socially distancing were potentially superspreading events. This video can not be played Can we believe the polls this time? Infection rates are alsorising sharply across Europe, including in the UK, France and Germany. Global stock markets plunged on Wednesdayamid fears that the pandemic could reverse tepid economic recoveries. The two presidential rivals' divisions over the coronavirus were on stark display once again on Wednesday. Speaking from his home of Wilmington, Delaware, Democrat Joe Biden said he would not campaign ""on the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch"". Mr Biden - who has not ruled out further lockdowns - pledged instead to ""let science drive our decisions"". ""Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,"" he said. ""I do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things."" This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins He also railed against Mr Trump's attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in the midst of a pandemic. The Democrat and his wife Jill Biden cast their early ballots soon afterwards. Mr Trump voted early on Saturday in Florida. At a rally in Goodyear, Arizona, Mr Trump warned that a Biden presidency would lead to more lockdowns and economic misery for Americans. ""If you vote for Joe Biden it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no thanksgivings, no Christmas, and no Fourth of July together. ""Other than that you'll have a wonderful life. Can't see anybody, but that's alright."" This video can not be played Nigel Farage praises Trump at Arizona rally, calling him the ""bravest person I have ever met"" He cast the election as ""a choice between a Trump super-recovery and a Biden depression"". At an earlier rally in Bullhead City, also in Arizona, a state where looser rules on social distancing make staging crowded events easier, Mr Trump poked fun at mask mandates in Democratic-run states. An F-16 fighter jet was scrambled during the rally to ward off an aircraft that entered the air space without authorisation. The warplane fired flares to get the pilot's attention and the smaller aircraft was escorted out of the area without further incident, according to the North American Aerospace Command. The mid-air interception caught the notice of the president, who looked up at the roaring jet and said: ""I love that sound."" At every rally stop on this multi-state, cross-country campaign swing, Donald Trump - in his words and in his actions - is trying to convince the country that the coronavirus pandemic is on the verge of being ""vanquished"". At times, he warns that the cure - aggressive mitigation efforts - cannot be worse than the disease. At others, he downplays the severity of the pandemic. ""I caught it,"" he told the crowd at one of his Arizona rallies. ""And then you get better. And then you get immune."" Sometimes he boasts about the effectiveness of his response and how, if he hadn't acted, two million Americans would have died (this is a number experts say would have been approached only if the government had done nothing at all). Donald Trump is reaching for a way to address a cold truth - that opinion polls indicate the public believes the coronavirus pandemic is the most pressing issue facing the nation, and the president is not doing a good enough job in handling it. With only five days before the election, and with 75 million Americans having voted so far, time is running out for the president to change minds. But in a relentless string of rallies, by dint of sheer determination and endurance, he seems determined to try. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election The US Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that voting officials in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, two key battleground states, could accept postal ballots for several days after the general election in an outcome that cheered Democrats. In the North Carolina case, the justices allowed lower court decisions to stand that permitted the state board of elections to extend the deadline for accepting ballots to nine days after the vote. The highest US court also declined to decide before election day whether Pennsylvania election officials can continue receiving votes for three days after the vote. The court's new justice, Amy Coney Barrett, did not take part in either case. Meanwhile, a study by the US Center for Responsive Politics projected the total cost of this US general election would hit $14bn (Â£10.7bn), double the cost of the last one.

"This video can not be played In comments before his suspension from Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism complaints numbers were ""exaggerated"" Labour has suspended Jeremy Corbyn from the party over his reaction to a highly critical report on anti-Semitism. The human rights watchdog found Labour responsible for ""unlawful"" harassment and discrimination during Mr Corbyn's four-and-a-half years as leader. But he later said the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated"" by opponents. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn was being suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Mr Corbyn reacted by calling the move ""political"" and promised to ""strongly contest"" it. The suspension will remain in place while the party carries out an investigation into his remarks. What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour's agony over anti-Semitism far from over Sir Keir Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, said the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's (EHRC) report had brought ""a day of shame"" for the party. It found Labour responsible forthree breaches of the Equality Act:,external Political interference in anti-Semitism complaints Failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints Harassment, including the use of anti-Semitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of anti-Semitism were fake or smears The EHRC found evidence of 23 instances of ""inappropriate involvement"" by Mr Corbyn's office. Sir Keir, who served under Mr Corbyn as shadow Brexit secretary, promised to implement the report's recommendations ""as soon as possible in the New Year"". This seems not to have been a deliberately designed collision between the current party boss and his predecessor. But this was an explosive political parting of ways, provoked in part by Mr Corbyn's trademark determination not to bend. This is an attribute admired by many of his devotees, a frustration abhorred by his detractors and a sadness to those in Labour who believe it coloured the party's handling of anti-Semitism. For Sir Keir, this episode does, perhaps by accident rather than design, prove beyond doubt his slogan - Labour is under new leadership - to be true. Read Laura's blog Responding to the EHRC's findings, Mr Corbyn said he was ""always determined to eliminate all forms of racism"". He claimed his team had ""acted to speed up, not hinder the process"" and that the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party"". Shortly afterwards Labour general secretary David Evans suspended Mr Corbyn. The party said this was ""in light of his comments"" and ""his failure to retract them subsequently"". This video can not be played Keir Starmer ""disappointed"" with Corbyn's response Mr Corbyn, Labour leader from 2015 until this year, reacted on Twitter, promising to ""strongly contest the political intervention to suspend me"". He said those who denied the party had an anti-Semitism problem were ""wrong"" and he would ""continue to support a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of racism"". In an interview, Mr Corbyn did not retract his earlier comments and said: ""I'll be appealing to the party and those who made the decision to kindly think again."" 10:00 GMTThe EHRC releases its report saying Labour acted unlawfully over anti-Semitism 10:36Jeremy Corbyn says there was an anti-Semitism problem in the party, but it was ""dramatically overstated"" 11:07Sir Keir Starmer says those who think anti-Semitism is ""exaggerated or a factional attack"" are ""part of the problem"" 11:15Sir Keir is repeatedly asked if he will expel Mr Corbyn for ""exaggerated"" comments - he says the report did not name individuals and repeats his previous statement 12:15Mr Corbyn records an interview, to be released at 13:00, disagreeing with a number of the report's points and repeating that the number of anti-Semitism cases is ""exaggerated"" 13:06Labour announces it has suspended Mr Corbyn Sir Keir defended the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn, saying: ""We cannot say 'zero tolerance' and then turn a blind eye."" He added: ""I was very disappointed in Jeremy Corbyn's statement and appropriate action has been taken, which I fully support."" Sir Keir said would not ""interfere"" with the party's internal investigation into Mr Corbyn's statement. Labour has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism since 2016, with a number of MPs quitting the party in protest while Mr Corbyn was leader. Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: ""[The suspension] is the right decision following Corbyn's shameful reaction to the EHRC report."" The party was ""finally saying enough is enough, anti-Semitism can never be tolerated"", she added. This video can not be played Speaking before he was suspended, Ex-Labour MP Luciana Berger accuses Mr Corbyn of anti-Semitism Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Jeremy is a thoroughly decent man, but he has an absolute blind spot and a denial when it comes to some of these issues."" But groups on the left of the Labour movement attacked the decision to suspend him. The Socialist Campaign Group said it ""firmly"" opposed the move, adding: ""We will work tirelessly for his reinstatement."" And Momentum, among Mr Corbyn's strongest backers, said: ""It is a massive attack on the left by the new leadership and should be immediately lifted in the interests of party unity."" For the Conservatives, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has written to Sir Keir, saying he ""seemingly found it much harder to find the moral character and backbone to do what was right"" while serving in the shadow cabinet under Mr Corbyn. The EHRC launched its investigation last year after receiving a number of complaints from organisations and individuals, including the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism and the Jewish Labour Movement.

"British employers planned making redundancies at close to a record level in September, as the second wave of coronavirus took its toll on jobs. Some 1,734 employers notified the government of plans to cut 20 or more posts, close to the peak levels seen in June and July. Those were the highest levels seen since 2006, the earliest date for which figures have been published. The data was released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information request. September saw an increased number of restrictions introduced around the UK as a second wave of Covid-19 infections took hold. A number of big businesses, including Lloyds Bank, Shell, Virgin Atlantic and the Premier Inn owner Whitbread were among those announcing plans to cut staff. The total number of positions notified as at risk in September was 82,000 - down on the peak in the summer, but three times the level of the previous September. ""What we may be seeing is firms who were intending to bring people back deciding that they can no longer do it because of the worsening economic climate,"" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. In September, employers were asked to pay a greater proportion of the costs of staff members on furlough, with the scheme due to end completely on 31 October. On 24 September, Chancellor Rishi Sunakunveiled a new scheme to support jobshit by the crisis, and in early October he announcedfurther measures to support employmentat businesses in areas hit with new local restrictions. A government spokesperson said: ""Protecting jobs is an absolute priority and our Plan for Jobs will help more businesses safeguard them as we head into winter. Our updated Job Support Scheme makes it easier to keep staff on and further adds to our Â£200bn Covid-19 response to protect jobs, incomes and businesses."" October's redundancy figures will be the first to cover a full month when employers have known what will replace the furlough scheme. ""If the new job support scheme goes down well, we might see some of these redundancies not being completed. But if employers don't take it up, we might see another uptick in October,"" said Mr Wilson. Sarah Burridge Early this year, business was picking up at Sarah Burridge's company in Leicester. She worked in administration at a specialist asbestos removal company. 2019 had been tough, but orders were coming in again. Then the pandemic struck, business dried up, and Sarah was put on furlough. While the rest of the country saw restrictions lifted in the summer, Leicester went into a second lockdown. Sarah's bosses told her they couldn't afford to keep her on, and she was made redundant at the end of August. She has some modest savings from an inheritance. ""That's meant to be my pension,"" she says. ""My youngest son was disabled, I had to stay at home longer and look after him, and therefore I have a very small pension pot."" It means she can't claim universal credit while she's out of work - and she fears she may have to draw on her savings to make ends meet. Sarah is looking for new jobs, even considering parcel delivery and courier work, though it's not ideal to start such a physically demanding job in her mid-fifties. ""The jobs market is pretty dire at the moment,"" she says. ""There's very little out there, and what is out there, there are so many applicants for it."" Employers are obliged to notify government when they plan to make 20 or more staff redundant in any single ""establishment"" using an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy form. This data picks up an increase in redundancy plans long before the Office for National Statistics' redundancy figures, which appear with a lag of several months. ONS numbers showed 227,000 redundancies between June and August, a record increase of 113,000 on the previous three-month period, confirming the surge in HR1 redundanciesreported by the BBC in the summer. Firms often make fewer job cuts than they initially plan. However, any redundancy process involving fewer than 20 people doesn't need to be reported, so in the past the ONS redundancy figures havemostly been higher than the HR1 numbers. Employers in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and they are not included in these figures. Are you coming to the end of your furlough?

"First since the 1960s to open with degree awarding powers already in place A new higher education institution is opening in London next autumn which will not teach traditional separate subjects - but will be able to award its own degrees. The London Interdisciplinary School is opening in Whitechapel, east London. It is claimed as the first institution since the 1960s to start from scratch with full UK degree awarding powers. The private college will be partly owned by the UK government, which is part-funding the project. Students will all take a combined arts and science course aimed at teaching problem-solving skills. Rather than offering conventional degree subjects, such as history or physics, there will be a single three-year degree course focusing on global issues, such as climate change, with the aim of ""cutting across disciplines"". The London Interdisciplinary School (LIS), which will have 100 students in its first cohort paying Â£9,000 per year, is claimed as the first entirely new provider for a generation that will be able to issue its own degrees from the outset. The new institution will move straight to being able to award its own degrees when it opens This is expected to be formally announced later this week. Other new institutions have gained degree awarding powers after a number of years and transitions in status. For instance the Dyson Institute set up in 2017 will get degree awarding powers from next year. Ed Fidoe, one of the founders, says the idea of the new institution is to provide something different, rather than replicate the traditional model of university education. ""It has to be genuinely different, or otherwise what's the point?"" says Mr Fidoe, who previously helped to set up the School 21 free school in east London. Dyson Institute to tackle skills shortages England's education secretary against 50% university target The 'taboo' about who doesn't go to university There will be no specific A-level requirements for entry. Instead, applicants would be interviewed to see if they would be suitable for a course that would cut across different subject areas, and have strong links with employers. Mr Fidoe believes that an approach based on tackling real-world problems will be more engaging for students - and will produce graduates who will be attractive to employers. He says there has been a ""paradox"" in higher education, that universities produce highly innovative research, but there has been much less change in what they offer and how they teach students. Mary Curnock Cook, former head of the Ucas admissions service, said that the experiment with crossing disciplines and subject areas would be a ""superb and rigorous innovation"". Government financial backing is from the Future Fund, supported by the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which has offered matched funding to support ventures during the Covid pandemic. Along with Mr Fidoe, the LIS is being founded by academic Carl Gombrich and online entrepreneur Chris Persson. The new college is aiming to become a fully-fledged university, with a university title, in the next few years.

"A study by Imperial College London suggests nearly 100,000 people are catching Covid-19 every day in England The authors say current measures to curb infections are not sufficient and ""something has to change"" More than a dozen areas will move to England's ""high alert"" level, with its additional restrictions, from Saturday West Yorkshire will become the latest area to enter the top level of measures, joining tier three on Monday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set out Scotland's new five-tier Covid measures, but has not ruled out another national lockdown In Wales, the exams regulator is recommending GCSEs be scrapped in favour of assessments next summer The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and a further 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955 France and Germany are both reinstating some form of national lockdown, as Europe confronts a surge in cases and deaths Globally there have been more than 44.4 million coronavirus cases and more than 1.1 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay That's all from us today, thanks for joining our live coverage. Here's a recap of the day's top stories: The leader of Leeds City Council has said it was a ""very difficult decision""to move West Yorkshire into tier threeand a ""significant moment"" for Leeds and the region. Leeds City Council's chief executive Tom Riordan said a financial support package of Â£46.6m had been negotiated with the government for the region in addition to the tier two funding - with an further Â£12.7m for testing and tracing Casinos, car boot sales, adult gaming centres and soft-play areas will have to close under the new restrictions. Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals, said the number of Covid patients in hospitals had increased to 268 today - higher than in the first wave. An experimental drug that could prevent Covid-19 patients from becoming seriously ill is being trialled in England. The BBC's Fergus Walsh spoke to two volunteers who are taking part in the trial at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. This video can not be played Coronavirus treatment: Experimental drug in trial phase West Yorkshire is to become the latest area to join the top level of restrictions in England when it enters tier three at 00:01 GMT on Monday. Under tier three - also known as ""very high"" - restrictions, there can be no mixing of households indoors or ourdoors in private gardens. Pubs and bars that do not serve substantial food must close and people are advised to avoid travel out of the area. Overnight stays are banned and you cannot hold a wedding reception. In addition, casinos, soft play, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales must shut in West Yorkshire. Shisha cafes will not be allowed to serve shisha but may operate as cafe. Redcar could soon join tier three Local leaders in the Tees Valley area of the north-east of England say the government has informed them of its intention to put the region into tier three restrictions. A statement on behalf of the leaders of Redcar and Cleveland, Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool Councils, the mayor of Middlesbrough and the Tees Valley mayor, said further discussions would take place on Friday with nothing agreed as yet. Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council leader Mary Lanigan, speaking on behalf of he group, said: âThe government informed us late last night of their intention to take the Tees Valley into tier three restrictions. ""We have had an initial meeting with ministers this afternoon where they again stressed this intention due to the current infection rate and the increased number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19."" Nottinghamshire is expected to receive Â£23.1m in funding to support businesses and managing Covid-19 enforcement as it enters tier three restrictions. The funding will see a Â£16.5m business support scheme for firms in the county and Â£6.6m for managing systems like NHS test and trace locally. The figure excludes Nottingham city, which will receive its own funding. The news comes as the whole of the county enters the highest coronavirus restrictions in England on Friday. Under Nottinghamshire's tier three restrictions alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Deaths and hospital admissions related to coronavirus are continuing to rise across the UK, with the number of patients in hospital with Covid now around half of what it was at the peak in spring. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm People living in Stockholm and the Swedish regions of VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland and ÃstergÃ¶tland have been advised against going to gyms, museums, libraries, swimming pools and shopping centres until 19 November. They have also been told to avoid physical contact with people they do not live with. This follows similar restrictions introduced in the regions of Uppsala County and SkÃ¥ne last week, following an uptick of infections in these areas. All regions with tougher guidelines will keep the current limit of 50 people at public events. National guidelines are set to change on 1 November, allowing public gatherings of up to 300 people, as long as social distancing measures are in place. Social clubs in Lancashire say they are ""bitterly disappointed"" after the UK government closed an apparent loophole that allowed them to serve alcohol while in the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Under tier three rules,pubs and bars must closeunless they serve substantial meals. But some social clubs were continuing to serve alcohol without foodafter their local councils told them this was permitted. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde had all advised social clubs that the discrepancy existed because they held club premises certificates, rather than premises licences. But the government has since clarified that social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they also serve substantial meals. A club in Preston said its business would now ""slowly die"", although the treasurer of another club said the rule change was expected because someone had ""ticked the wrong box and not thought about us"".

It is part of Â£687m of Covid-19 funding from the Treasury in London. A further Â£100m has been redistributed by ministers between departments as part of the normal budgeting process. Hospices will get Â£7m, as well as Â£15m for sport and Â£25m for the taxi and coach industry, while councils are to get an extra Â£15m and the Department for Infrastructure is getting Â£10m. It was also confirmed by ministers that NI schools will reopen on Monday, with extra measures in place to allow pupils to return to classrooms safely. Read the full story here. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"" on Thursday afternoon A former MP in Northern Ireland and two other Sinn FÃ©in officials have resigned over a failure to return grants of Â£10,000 paid by a Stormont emergency Covid fund despite MP and MLA constituency offices being ineligible for the scheme. Three Sinn FÃ©in offices received the payments, which have since been repaid. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"", saying the grant was lodged into a joint account of which she is a named signature with her husband. ""I fully accept that as a named signature on the account that I should have taken extra steps to verify this situation before it was brought to my attention on Tuesday."" She has resigned as a senator in the Seanad (Irish Senate). Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald has accepted McCallion's resignation, as well as those of two other Sinn FÃ©in officials. She apologised for their ""failures"". Cyprus and Lithuania have been removed from England's travel corridor list, the Department for Transport has announced. That means, from this Sunday, people arriving from those countries will have to  self-isolate for two weeks. The decision comes after a rise in coronavirus cases in both countries. Lithuania's seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 people has reached 140, while Cyprus is on 112. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: ""We are not adding any countries to the list of travel corridoors this week."" You can read more about the UK's travel quarantine rules here.

People are being urged not to travel into or out of council areas where there are level three restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people in hospital with Covid has risen to more than 10,000. This is half the level it was at the peak in spring and the highest number for nearly six months. It comes after a sustained rise in admissions since September. It means around one in 13 hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients. That may not sound a lot, but there are two things to remember. Firstly, hospital capacity has been affected by the need for social distancing and the segregation of wards, meaning not all beds can be used. Secondly, the admissions have not been evenly distributed. The north west of England is caring for nearly a quarter of the patients. That has left hospitals in places like Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool very close to capacity, although there are signs the rise in admissions may be levelling off. Pizza Express says it is cutting around 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after recent trading worsened due to tightened Covid restrictions. It comes two months after therestaurant chain revealed
plans to cut 1,100 roles and close 73 of its restaurants. No further restaurant sites will shut as a result of the latest cuts, it said. The chain said its city centre sites had been ""particularly hard-hit"" while some of its suburban and out-of-town locations had seen more resilient trading. Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director, said the chain's aim had been to keep staff and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible but the rise in coronavirus cases had caused footfall to decline across the UK and expected that to continue for ""some months"". The chain was doing ""what we can"" to support those affected, she said, adding that the cuts will ""give us more resilience through the next six months"" and enable it to continue serving customers in its restaurants and at home in the ""years ahead"". At least 175 people have tested positive for coronavirus at a meat processing factory in Norfolk. All 1,000 workers at Cranswick Country Foods in Watton are being tested after staff in the butchery section were found to have Covid-19. Breckland Council officials and NHS Test and Trace staff have been deployed to Watton for ""reassurance"". Four positive cases in the butchery department were confirmed on 15 October and testing was brought in five days later. Testing between 22 and 23 October found 175 cases. Norfolk's director of public health Dr Louise Smith said 350 workers had been tested so far. Read the full story here. The party included a hired marquee, DJ decks and live entertainers The organiser ofa christening party attended by up to 50 peoplehas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching Covid-19 rules. Some guests had travelled from London to the gathering in the Blakenhall area of Wolverhampton on Saturday, which included a hired marquee, DJ decks and live entertainers, West Midlands Police said. Wolverhampton is currently in tier two, with a ban on mixing indoors. Supt Simon Inglis said it was a ""reckless breach of Covid rules"" at a time when the virus was spreading. When police arrived at the home, the male organiser told them around 20 people were present but officers said they found more than 40 partygoers at the property. Told the party was a breach of Covid rules, the organiser told officers: ""Oh my god, I spent too much money on this party. Give me one hour."" The economy has reopened but full recovery remains out of reach, especially in cities such as New York The US economy emerged quickly from the depths of the crisis triggered by coronavirus lockdowns earlier this year, but full recovery remains out of reach, official figures show. The economy grew at a record 7.4% in the three months to 30 September from the previous quarter, when it suffered a severe decline. But output remained 2.9% lower compared to the same period a year ago and analysts warn the rebound may be running out of steam. ""Overall, the initial recovery in GDP after the first wave of lockdowns were lifted was stronger than we originally anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""But, with coronavirus infections hitting a record high in recent days and any additional fiscal stimulus unlikely to arrive until, at the earliest, the start of next year, further progress will be much slower.""

"A study by Imperial College London suggests nearly 100,000 people are catching Covid-19 every day in England The authors say current measures to curb infections are not sufficient and ""something has to change"" More than a dozen areas will move to England's ""high alert"" level, with its additional restrictions, from Saturday West Yorkshire will become the latest area to enter the top level of measures, joining tier three on Monday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set out Scotland's new five-tier Covid measures, but has not ruled out another national lockdown In Wales, the exams regulator is recommending GCSEs be scrapped in favour of assessments next summer The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and a further 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955 France and Germany are both reinstating some form of national lockdown, as Europe confronts a surge in cases and deaths Globally there have been more than 44.4 million coronavirus cases and more than 1.1 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hamish Mackay That's all from us today, thanks for joining our live coverage. Here's a recap of the day's top stories: The leader of Leeds City Council has said it was a ""very difficult decision""to move West Yorkshire into tier threeand a ""significant moment"" for Leeds and the region. Leeds City Council's chief executive Tom Riordan said a financial support package of Â£46.6m had been negotiated with the government for the region in addition to the tier two funding - with an further Â£12.7m for testing and tracing Casinos, car boot sales, adult gaming centres and soft-play areas will have to close under the new restrictions. Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals, said the number of Covid patients in hospitals had increased to 268 today - higher than in the first wave. An experimental drug that could prevent Covid-19 patients from becoming seriously ill is being trialled in England. The BBC's Fergus Walsh spoke to two volunteers who are taking part in the trial at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. This video can not be played Coronavirus treatment: Experimental drug in trial phase West Yorkshire is to become the latest area to join the top level of restrictions in England when it enters tier three at 00:01 GMT on Monday. Under tier three - also known as ""very high"" - restrictions, there can be no mixing of households indoors or ourdoors in private gardens. Pubs and bars that do not serve substantial food must close and people are advised to avoid travel out of the area. Overnight stays are banned and you cannot hold a wedding reception. In addition, casinos, soft play, adult gaming centres, betting shops and car boot sales must shut in West Yorkshire. Shisha cafes will not be allowed to serve shisha but may operate as cafe. Redcar could soon join tier three Local leaders in the Tees Valley area of the north-east of England say the government has informed them of its intention to put the region into tier three restrictions. A statement on behalf of the leaders of Redcar and Cleveland, Darlington, Stockton and Hartlepool Councils, the mayor of Middlesbrough and the Tees Valley mayor, said further discussions would take place on Friday with nothing agreed as yet. Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council leader Mary Lanigan, speaking on behalf of he group, said: âThe government informed us late last night of their intention to take the Tees Valley into tier three restrictions. ""We have had an initial meeting with ministers this afternoon where they again stressed this intention due to the current infection rate and the increased number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19."" Nottinghamshire is expected to receive Â£23.1m in funding to support businesses and managing Covid-19 enforcement as it enters tier three restrictions. The funding will see a Â£16.5m business support scheme for firms in the county and Â£6.6m for managing systems like NHS test and trace locally. The figure excludes Nottingham city, which will receive its own funding. The news comes as the whole of the county enters the highest coronavirus restrictions in England on Friday. Under Nottinghamshire's tier three restrictions alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Deaths and hospital admissions related to coronavirus are continuing to rise across the UK, with the number of patients in hospital with Covid now around half of what it was at the peak in spring. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm People living in Stockholm and the Swedish regions of VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland and ÃstergÃ¶tland have been advised against going to gyms, museums, libraries, swimming pools and shopping centres until 19 November. They have also been told to avoid physical contact with people they do not live with. This follows similar restrictions introduced in the regions of Uppsala County and SkÃ¥ne last week, following an uptick of infections in these areas. All regions with tougher guidelines will keep the current limit of 50 people at public events. National guidelines are set to change on 1 November, allowing public gatherings of up to 300 people, as long as social distancing measures are in place. Social clubs in Lancashire say they are ""bitterly disappointed"" after the UK government closed an apparent loophole that allowed them to serve alcohol while in the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions. Under tier three rules,pubs and bars must closeunless they serve substantial meals. But some social clubs were continuing to serve alcohol without foodafter their local councils told them this was permitted. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde had all advised social clubs that the discrepancy existed because they held club premises certificates, rather than premises licences. But the government has since clarified that social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they also serve substantial meals. A club in Preston said its business would now ""slowly die"", although the treasurer of another club said the rule change was expected because someone had ""ticked the wrong box and not thought about us"".

It is part of Â£687m of Covid-19 funding from the Treasury in London. A further Â£100m has been redistributed by ministers between departments as part of the normal budgeting process. Hospices will get Â£7m, as well as Â£15m for sport and Â£25m for the taxi and coach industry, while councils are to get an extra Â£15m and the Department for Infrastructure is getting Â£10m. It was also confirmed by ministers that NI schools will reopen on Monday, with extra measures in place to allow pupils to return to classrooms safely. Read the full story here. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"" on Thursday afternoon A former MP in Northern Ireland and two other Sinn FÃ©in officials have resigned over a failure to return grants of Â£10,000 paid by a Stormont emergency Covid fund despite MP and MLA constituency offices being ineligible for the scheme. Three Sinn FÃ©in offices received the payments, which have since been repaid. Elisha McCallion apologised ""unreservedly"", saying the grant was lodged into a joint account of which she is a named signature with her husband. ""I fully accept that as a named signature on the account that I should have taken extra steps to verify this situation before it was brought to my attention on Tuesday."" She has resigned as a senator in the Seanad (Irish Senate). Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald has accepted McCallion's resignation, as well as those of two other Sinn FÃ©in officials. She apologised for their ""failures"". Cyprus and Lithuania have been removed from England's travel corridor list, the Department for Transport has announced. That means, from this Sunday, people arriving from those countries will have to  self-isolate for two weeks. The decision comes after a rise in coronavirus cases in both countries. Lithuania's seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 people has reached 140, while Cyprus is on 112. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: ""We are not adding any countries to the list of travel corridoors this week."" You can read more about the UK's travel quarantine rules here.

People are being urged not to travel into or out of council areas where there are level three restrictions. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of people in hospital with Covid has risen to more than 10,000. This is half the level it was at the peak in spring and the highest number for nearly six months. It comes after a sustained rise in admissions since September. It means around one in 13 hospital beds are occupied by Covid patients. That may not sound a lot, but there are two things to remember. Firstly, hospital capacity has been affected by the need for social distancing and the segregation of wards, meaning not all beds can be used. Secondly, the admissions have not been evenly distributed. The north west of England is caring for nearly a quarter of the patients. That has left hospitals in places like Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool very close to capacity, although there are signs the rise in admissions may be levelling off. Pizza Express says it is cutting around 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after recent trading worsened due to tightened Covid restrictions. It comes two months after therestaurant chain revealed
plans to cut 1,100 roles and close 73 of its restaurants. No further restaurant sites will shut as a result of the latest cuts, it said. The chain said its city centre sites had been ""particularly hard-hit"" while some of its suburban and out-of-town locations had seen more resilient trading. Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director, said the chain's aim had been to keep staff and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible but the rise in coronavirus cases had caused footfall to decline across the UK and expected that to continue for ""some months"". The chain was doing ""what we can"" to support those affected, she said, adding that the cuts will ""give us more resilience through the next six months"" and enable it to continue serving customers in its restaurants and at home in the ""years ahead"". At least 175 people have tested positive for coronavirus at a meat processing factory in Norfolk. All 1,000 workers at Cranswick Country Foods in Watton are being tested after staff in the butchery section were found to have Covid-19. Breckland Council officials and NHS Test and Trace staff have been deployed to Watton for ""reassurance"". Four positive cases in the butchery department were confirmed on 15 October and testing was brought in five days later. Testing between 22 and 23 October found 175 cases. Norfolk's director of public health Dr Louise Smith said 350 workers had been tested so far. Read the full story here. The party included a hired marquee, DJ decks and live entertainers The organiser ofa christening party attended by up to 50 peoplehas been fined Â£10,000 for breaching Covid-19 rules. Some guests had travelled from London to the gathering in the Blakenhall area of Wolverhampton on Saturday, which included a hired marquee, DJ decks and live entertainers, West Midlands Police said. Wolverhampton is currently in tier two, with a ban on mixing indoors. Supt Simon Inglis said it was a ""reckless breach of Covid rules"" at a time when the virus was spreading. When police arrived at the home, the male organiser told them around 20 people were present but officers said they found more than 40 partygoers at the property. Told the party was a breach of Covid rules, the organiser told officers: ""Oh my god, I spent too much money on this party. Give me one hour."" The economy has reopened but full recovery remains out of reach, especially in cities such as New York The US economy emerged quickly from the depths of the crisis triggered by coronavirus lockdowns earlier this year, but full recovery remains out of reach, official figures show. The economy grew at a record 7.4% in the three months to 30 September from the previous quarter, when it suffered a severe decline. But output remained 2.9% lower compared to the same period a year ago and analysts warn the rebound may be running out of steam. ""Overall, the initial recovery in GDP after the first wave of lockdowns were lifted was stronger than we originally anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""But, with coronavirus infections hitting a record high in recent days and any additional fiscal stimulus unlikely to arrive until, at the earliest, the start of next year, further progress will be much slower.""

"Social contacts in Germany will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of a long, hard winter ahead as she defended the reinstatement of a national lockdown. Mrs Merkel was heckled by right-wing MPs as she outlined the new measures in parliament. Rising coronavirus infections and deaths are triggering tougher restrictions across Europe. France restores a lockdown on Friday, ordering people to stay at home except for essential work or medical reasons. President Emmanuel Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Daily Covid deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Thursday, authorities reported 47,637 new cases compared to 36,437 a day earlier and 235 new deaths, nine fewer than on Wednesday. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? German health officials said on Thursday that another 89 people had died in the past 24 hours, with a record 16,774 infections. Germany's new measures, which come into force on Monday, are not as far-reaching as in France, but they include the closure of restaurants, bars, gyms and theatres, Mrs Merkel said. The UK reported a further 23,065 cases on Thursday, and an additional 280 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 45,955. In England,a new study shows almost 100,000 people are catching the virus every day, putting pressure on the government to change policy from a regional approach. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the continent was ""deep in the second wave"". ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas,"" she said. This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November The first wave of the virus earlier this year hit some parts of Europe incredibly hard, while other areas were able to escape the worst. President Macron warned the second wave ""no doubt will be harder than the first"" Italy, Spain, France and the UK were among the worst-hit nations, with all imposing strict national lockdowns that over time brought cases, hospital admissions and deaths down to a very low level but ravaged economies. Restrictions started to lift in the early summer, with non-essential shops, bars and restaurants reopening, and travel restarting. But in August cases began to rise again, with a major acceleration in recent weeks that has alarmed policymakers. Countries that were not hit badly by the first wave - such as the Czech Republic and Poland - have not been spared this time, with experts warning of alarming infection rates across much of the continent. Addressing parliament on Thursday Mrs Merkel said that ""winter will be hard - four long, difficult months - but it will come to an end"". ""This pandemic brings the question of freedom to the fore. Freedom is not 'every man for himself', it is responsibility - for oneself, one's family, the workplace. It shows us we are part of a whole,"" she said. During her speech, Mrs Merkel was heckled by members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party who oppose the restrictions. Leader Alexander Gauland accused the government of ""corona dictatorship"". In response, Mrs Merkel warned that disinformation and conspiracy theories undermined the fight against the pandemic. The AfD has staged protests against the government's coronavirus measures Germany, like other countries,has seen protests by people claiming restrictions are unwarranted. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed the government. Germany's partial lockdown will last until 30 November under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers. Bars and restaurants will close except for takeaway, but schools and kindergartens will remain open. Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted. In terms of economic help, smaller companies and the self-employed badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty Meanwhile in France, Mr Macron said that under the new rules, people would need to fill in a form to justify leaving their homes, as had been required in the initial lockdown in March. Social gatherings are banned. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". ""Like all our neighbours, we are submerged by the sudden acceleration of the virus,"" said Mr Macron. Prime Minister Jean Castex told parliament on Thursday that all students aged six and over would have to wear face masks in class ""to protect all our children, teachers and parents"". Until now masks have only been mandatory for students aged 11 and older. Jean Castex said greater effort was needed to stop the spread of the coronavirus He said companies would be strongly urged to have their employees work from home ""five days a week"". ""We have to keep working as much as possible, but of course under strict sanitary conditions that stop the virus from spreading,"" he said, adding: ""Unemployment and poverty can also kill."" He later gave more details on what was permitted under the new rules, including going out for food shopping, going to work, going to a doctor or to a hospital or responding to a judicial or administrative summons. People are also allowed out for up to an hour for physical exercise or to take pets out - but only for a distance of 1km from their home. Ahead of All Saints Day on 1 November - an important day in France when families traditionally visit the graves of loved ones - the government said florists would be allowed to remain open until Sunday evening. Unlike the previous lockdown, markets, parks and gardens will be allowed to stay open. Sports halls and gyms are to close. Polandreported record daily infections and deaths on Thursday. Health officials said there were 20,156 new cases and 301 fatalities.The country has imposed a nationwide ""red zone"" lockdownthat includes the partial closure of primary schools and restaurants. Italy, which was the European epicentre at the start of the first wave of the virus, has already introduced new restrictions which will be in place for a month.  All bars and restaurants across the country have to close by 18:00, although they can provide takeaways later. Gyms, swimming pools, theatres and cinemas have to close, but museums can remain open. Gatherings for weddings, baptisms and funerals are banned. How the Czech Covid response went wrong Spainbegan its nationwide curfew on 25 October after the government declared a new state of emergency. People in all regions, with the exception of the Canary Islands, have to stay at home between 23:00 and 06:00. According tothe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,external,the Czech Republichas the worst infection rate on the continent at 1,448 cases per 100,000 people over 14 days. It has imposed a partial lockdown. Belgium, which has Europe's second-worst infection rate per capita, has reported its highest number of hospital admissions for Covid-19 since a peak on 6 April. There are 5,924 patients in hospital with the virus, 993 of whom are in intensive care.

"A recent report called interference by Russian President Vladimir Putin's government ""the new normal"" A group of MPs and peers has filed legal proceedings against the government for failing to ""protect"" UK democracy from Russian interference. They want judges to demand an independent inquiry, following claims relating to the 2016 EU referendum and the 2014 Scottish independence vote. They argue votes must be held under conditions ensuring free expression, under Europe's human rights convention. But the government said it had ""robust systems"" to deal with hostile states. It added that it was bringing forward legislation to deal with activities carried out by them. UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab In July, a report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said the UK government had not looked for evidence of whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 EU referendum. It called such actions by Moscow the ""new normal"", adding that ministers were ""playing catch-up"" and needed to take ""immediate action"". This summer's Russia Report was expected to answer the question over whether Russia interfered in political life. But instead it raised more questions leading to this latest salvo. The Intelligence and Security Committee said the government had failed to direct the intelligence services to look at evidence of any meddling from Moscow and so now others are trying to use a legal route to force the issue. But the government is unlikely to want to look backwards - especially when it comes to Brexit - and instead wants to focus on what it is planning in order to counter future foreign interference. Now a group - made up of Liberal Democrat peer Lord Strasburger, Labour MPs Ben Bradshaw and Chris Bryant, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, SNP MP Alyn Smith and ex-Conservative Baroness Wheatcroft - is calling for action to protect ""free and fair elections"". It is seeking a judicial review of what it calls the government's ""inaction"" over Russian interference, claiming it has breached its obligation under Article 3, Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Judges, the group says, should rule in favour of an independent investigation or public inquiry into Moscow's activities. Lord Strasburger said: ""For some reason the prime minister seems determined to keep us in the dark about these repeated Russian attacks on our democracy. ""Moscow's blizzard of cleverly disguised disinformation undermines our freedom as a sovereign state to choose our own leaders and set our country's direction."" Lord Ricketts, who was national security adviser from 2010 to 2012, is supporting the group. In a statement, he said: ""Given the importance of knowing the extent of past Russian interference in assessing the risk for future elections, I do not understand why the government would choose not to investigate."" A government spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on ongoing legal proceedings. ""Safeguarding our democracy will always be an absolute priority and the UK has robust systems in place to protect our elections and institutions from interference."" They added that the government was ""developing an online media literacy strategy to help empower the public to question the information they read online"". The ISC's report over the summer criticised intelligence agencies for not taking action during the 2016 EU referendum, despite ""credible open-source commentary"" suggesting ""influence campaigns"" from the Russians during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. But the government said it had ""seen no evidence of successful interference"" in the EU vote. Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin?

"Finance Minister Conor Murphy has announced a package worth Â£560m to help NI's health service tackle Covid-19. It is part of Â£687m of Covid-19 funding from the Treasury in London. A further Â£100m has been redistributed by ministers between departments as part of the normal budgeting process. Hospices will get Â£7m, as well as Â£15m for sport and Â£25m for the taxi and coach industry, while councils are to get an extra Â£15m and the Department for Infrastructure is getting Â£10m. It was also confirmed by ministers that NI schools will reopen on Monday, with extra measures in place to allow pupils to return to classrooms safely. That will include the mandatory wearing of face coverings for post-primary pupils on school transport. Schools closed on 19 October as part of tighter Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the NI Executive. Speaking at Stormont's press briefing on Thursday, First Minister Arlene Foster said it is ""the activity and mingling outside school gates that is of particular concern"", not what occurs within classroom settings. ""Messaging will be rolled out in the coming days,"" she added. On Thursday, ministers also discussed the effect of the latest restrictions on transmission rates in Northern Ireland. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported eight further Covid-19 related deaths on Thursday, bringing its total to 688. There were 822 further positive cases, with the total number of cases now 37,216. The Republic of Ireland reported six further Covid-related deaths and 866 new cases on Thursday. There are 43 people in ICU, an increase of two from Wednesday. There are now 330 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals in the country. The first minister said NI's R-rate - or reproduction rate - for case numbers had dropped below one for the first time since the early summer. ""There are green shoots of hope"", she added. Mrs Foster also said about 4,500 staff in the health service are off work on sick leave. She said 1,100 of those absences were Covid-related. The rest were ""standard sickness for this time of year,"" she added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said everyone in Northern Ireland ""needs to keep at this and do our part to stop this virus spreading"". She said the recent decrease in transmission of the virus in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area, which previously had the highest rate across the UK, was down to efforts of the public. Mr Murphy said some of the extra health money will be spent on enhancing the test, trace and isolate systems. He said there was also an extra Â£61m to meet increased education pressures. ""This covers costs with restarting schools including; funding to provide a safe learning environment for children and young people, staff costs, free school meals and uniform grants. ""This also includes, nearly Â£12 million for Education Authority pressures including special educational needs."" Mr Murphy said the Â£15m for sport was to help organisations which have lost income as a result of reduced spectators at their events, club membership and running competitions. Ministers have also approved extra financial support for taxi drivers and coach operators affected during the pandemic. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said a Â£14m package would go directly to taxi drivers. Some drivers havecriticised reports they will each be offereda one-off payment of Â£1,500. Coach and bus operators will receive a package worth Â£5m. NI records youngest Covid-19 related death NI Executive to approve reopening of schools Meanwhile Health Minister Robin Swann has instructed Trusts to provide free car parking to HSC staff until 31 March 2021. Mr Swann said: ""As our valued staff enter into a most challenging and pressurised time, I hope that this provides some welcome news.""

"British employers planned making redundancies at close to a record level in September, as the second wave of coronavirus took its toll on jobs. Some 1,734 employers notified the government of plans to cut 20 or more posts, close to the peak levels seen in June and July. Those were the highest levels seen since 2006, the earliest date for which figures have been published. The data was released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information request. September saw an increased number of restrictions introduced around the UK as a second wave of Covid-19 infections took hold. A number of big businesses, including Lloyds Bank, Shell, Virgin Atlantic and the Premier Inn owner Whitbread were among those announcing plans to cut staff. The total number of positions notified as at risk in September was 82,000 - down on the peak in the summer, but three times the level of the previous September. ""What we may be seeing is firms who were intending to bring people back deciding that they can no longer do it because of the worsening economic climate,"" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. In September, employers were asked to pay a greater proportion of the costs of staff members on furlough, with the scheme due to end completely on 31 October. On 24 September, Chancellor Rishi Sunakunveiled a new scheme to support jobshit by the crisis, and in early October he announcedfurther measures to support employmentat businesses in areas hit with new local restrictions. A government spokesperson said: ""Protecting jobs is an absolute priority and our Plan for Jobs will help more businesses safeguard them as we head into winter. Our updated Job Support Scheme makes it easier to keep staff on and further adds to our Â£200bn Covid-19 response to protect jobs, incomes and businesses."" October's redundancy figures will be the first to cover a full month when employers have known what will replace the furlough scheme. ""If the new job support scheme goes down well, we might see some of these redundancies not being completed. But if employers don't take it up, we might see another uptick in October,"" said Mr Wilson. Sarah Burridge Early this year, business was picking up at Sarah Burridge's company in Leicester. She worked in administration at a specialist asbestos removal company. 2019 had been tough, but orders were coming in again. Then the pandemic struck, business dried up, and Sarah was put on furlough. While the rest of the country saw restrictions lifted in the summer, Leicester went into a second lockdown. Sarah's bosses told her they couldn't afford to keep her on, and she was made redundant at the end of August. She has some modest savings from an inheritance. ""That's meant to be my pension,"" she says. ""My youngest son was disabled, I had to stay at home longer and look after him, and therefore I have a very small pension pot."" It means she can't claim universal credit while she's out of work - and she fears she may have to draw on her savings to make ends meet. Sarah is looking for new jobs, even considering parcel delivery and courier work, though it's not ideal to start such a physically demanding job in her mid-fifties. ""The jobs market is pretty dire at the moment,"" she says. ""There's very little out there, and what is out there, there are so many applicants for it."" Employers are obliged to notify government when they plan to make 20 or more staff redundant in any single ""establishment"" using an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy form. This data picks up an increase in redundancy plans long before the Office for National Statistics' redundancy figures, which appear with a lag of several months. ONS numbers showed 227,000 redundancies between June and August, a record increase of 113,000 on the previous three-month period, confirming the surge in HR1 redundanciesreported by the BBC in the summer. Firms often make fewer job cuts than they initially plan. However, any redundancy process involving fewer than 20 people doesn't need to be reported, so in the past the ONS redundancy figures havemostly been higher than the HR1 numbers. Employers in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and they are not included in these figures. Are you coming to the end of your furlough?

"Little Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock recently spoke out about sexism and racism in the industry There has been a significant increase in the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic staff in the music industry since 2016, a new report says. The proportion of minority ethnic employees has risen from 15.6% in 2016 to 22.3% this year, according to trade body UK Music. The report noted that representation is worse in higher-paid jobs. Among those earning more than Â£100,000 per year, just 27% were women and 12.2% were not white. In low-paid jobs - where salaries are less than Â£15,000 - the figures were 59.4% and 33.6% respectively. Overall, female representation was at 49.6% in 2020 - roughly the same as in 2016. UK music industry urged to drop 'offensive' BAME Drake and Ariana's label drops the term 'urban' Grammys drop 'urban' from major award category UK Music, which represents the recorded and live music industry, has conducted a diversity study every two years since 2016. The latest report follows moves in the industry to better support the black community, with initiatives such as #BlackoutTuesday, prompted by George Floyd's death and the Black Lives Matter campaign. Since then, artists includingLittle Mix's Leigh-Anne Pinnockhave come forward to discuss their experiences of racism in the industry. UK Music said more still needed to be done, and its latest report was accompanied by a 10-point plan to improve diversity. Among its commitments are: Removing the word ""urban"" to describe music of black origin, using genre-specific terms like R&B or soul instead Ending the use of the ""offensive and outdated"" term BAME in official communications Maintaining a database of people responsible for promoting diversity across UK Music UK Music members will commit to spending a portion of their annual recruitment budget to ensure a diverse candidate pool Members will pledge to increase diversity in middle and senior management UK Music chief executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin said: ""As an industry, we are united in our determination to lead the way on improving diversity and inclusion in our sector and across society. ""It's relevant not just to the music industry, but to organisations everywhere. If our music industry is to tell the story of modern-day Britain, then it needs to look like modern-day Britain too."" There has been increased scrutiny of diversity in the music industry as in all areas of society following the Black Lives Matter protests. In September, the newly-formed Black Music Coalition (BMC) set out its mission to ""protect, promote and advance the interests and views of black professionals within the UK music industry"". Its chair Sheryl Nwosu told the BBC last week that the new organisation ""fully supports"" the end of the term BAME. ""Far too often, BAME initiatives have fallen short of understanding the specific needs or support that each ethnic group require,"" said Miss Nwosu. ""In fact, it has served to amalgamate those needs as if a blanket approach will suffice. ""We implore all companies to dig deeper and listen to the varied underrepresented groups within their business so that bespoke support and programs can be devised in order to truly establish equity for all across the industry.""

"A recent report called interference by Russian President Vladimir Putin's government ""the new normal"" A group of MPs and peers has filed legal proceedings against the government for failing to ""protect"" UK democracy from Russian interference. They want judges to demand an independent inquiry, following claims relating to the 2016 EU referendum and the 2014 Scottish independence vote. They argue votes must be held under conditions ensuring free expression, under Europe's human rights convention. But the government said it had ""robust systems"" to deal with hostile states. It added that it was bringing forward legislation to deal with activities carried out by them. UK 'badly underestimated' Russian threat Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab In July, a report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said the UK government had not looked for evidence of whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 EU referendum. It called such actions by Moscow the ""new normal"", adding that ministers were ""playing catch-up"" and needed to take ""immediate action"". This summer's Russia Report was expected to answer the question over whether Russia interfered in political life. But instead it raised more questions leading to this latest salvo. The Intelligence and Security Committee said the government had failed to direct the intelligence services to look at evidence of any meddling from Moscow and so now others are trying to use a legal route to force the issue. But the government is unlikely to want to look backwards - especially when it comes to Brexit - and instead wants to focus on what it is planning in order to counter future foreign interference. Now a group - made up of Liberal Democrat peer Lord Strasburger, Labour MPs Ben Bradshaw and Chris Bryant, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, SNP MP Alyn Smith and ex-Conservative Baroness Wheatcroft - is calling for action to protect ""free and fair elections"". It is seeking a judicial review of what it calls the government's ""inaction"" over Russian interference, claiming it has breached its obligation under Article 3, Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Judges, the group says, should rule in favour of an independent investigation or public inquiry into Moscow's activities. Lord Strasburger said: ""For some reason the prime minister seems determined to keep us in the dark about these repeated Russian attacks on our democracy. ""Moscow's blizzard of cleverly disguised disinformation undermines our freedom as a sovereign state to choose our own leaders and set our country's direction."" Lord Ricketts, who was national security adviser from 2010 to 2012, is supporting the group. In a statement, he said: ""Given the importance of knowing the extent of past Russian interference in assessing the risk for future elections, I do not understand why the government would choose not to investigate."" A government spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on ongoing legal proceedings. ""Safeguarding our democracy will always be an absolute priority and the UK has robust systems in place to protect our elections and institutions from interference."" They added that the government was ""developing an online media literacy strategy to help empower the public to question the information they read online"". The ISC's report over the summer criticised intelligence agencies for not taking action during the 2016 EU referendum, despite ""credible open-source commentary"" suggesting ""influence campaigns"" from the Russians during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. But the government said it had ""seen no evidence of successful interference"" in the EU vote. Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin?

"Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, was Nigeria's first female finance and foreign minister The appointment of Nigeria's ex-finance minister to lead the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been thrown into doubt after the US opposed the move. On Wednesday, a WTO nominations committee recommended the group's 164 members appoint Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. She would be the first woman and first African to lead the WTO. But the US, critical of the WTO's handling of global trade, wants another woman, South Korea's Yoo Myung-hee, saying she could reform the body. Ms Okonjo-Iweala said she was ""immensely humbled"" to be nominated. But the four-month selection process to find the next WTO director-general hit a road block when Washington said it would continue to back South Korea's trade minister. In a statement critical of the WTO, the Office of the US Trade Representative, which advises President Donald Trump on trade policy, said the organisation ""must be led by someone with real, hands-on experience in the field"". Ms Yoo had ""distinguished herself"" as a trade expert and ""has all the skills necessary to be an effective leader of the organisation"", the statement said. It added: ""This is a very difficult time for the WTO and international trade. There have been no multilateral tariff negotiations in 25 years, the dispute settlement system has gotten out of control, and too few members fulfill basic transparency obligations. The WTO is badly in need of major reform."" The statement did not mention Ms Okonjo-Iweala. Earlier on Wednesday, after a WTO delegates meeting to discuss the appointment, spokesman Keith Rockwell said just one member country did not support Ms Okonjo-Iweala. ""All of the delegations that expressed their views today expressed very strong support for the process... for the outcome. Except for one,"" he said. Mr Trump has described the WTO as ""horrible"" and biased towards China, and some appointments to key roles in the organisation have already been blocked. WTO to name first female boss as shortlist narrows EU gets $4bn bargaining chip in US trade row Liam Fox out of WTO leader race as field narrows The WTO has called a meeting for 9 November - after the US presidential election - to discuss the issue. US opposition does not mean the Nigerian cannot be appointed, but Washington could nevertheless wield considerable influence over the final decision. Mr Rockwell told reporters there was likely to be ""frenzied activity"" to secure a consensus for Ms Okonjo-Iweala's appointment. She has the support of the European Union. The leadership void was created after outgoing WTO chief Roberto Azevedo stepped down a year early in August. The WTO is currently being steered by four deputies. Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, served as her country's first female finance and foreign minister and has a 25-year career behind her as a development economist at the World Bank.. She also serves on Twitter's board of directors, as chair of the GAVI vaccine alliance and as a special envoy for the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fight. If Ms Okonjo-Iweala is eventually appointed she will have a full in-tray. The WTO is already grappling with stalled trade talks and tensions between the US and China. Earlier this month she said that her broad experience in championing reform made her the right person to help put the WTO back on track.

"This video can not be played 'We will all get there together': President Macron places France into lockdown for November French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a second national lockdown until at least the end of November. Mr Macron said that under the new measures, starting on Friday, people would only be allowed to leave home for essential work or medical reasons. Non-essential businesses, such as restaurants and bars, will close, but schools and factories will remain open. Covid daily deaths in France are at the highest level since April. On Tuesday, 33,000 new cases were confirmed. Mr Macron said the country risked being ""overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first"". Meanwhile, Germany will impose an emergency lockdown that is less severe but includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres. Covid deaths in Europe rise sharply Tracking the pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Infections are rising sharply across Europe, including the UK which on Wednesday announced 310 new deaths and 24,701 new officially-recorded cases. In England, a new study estimatesalmost 100,000 people are actually catching the virus every day, with researchers warning that ""something has to change"". Night curfews are in force in several countries, including for 46 million people in France. News of the new restrictions being introduced in Europe's biggest economies led tosharp falls in the financial marketson Wednesday. The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. Major US indexes also sank 3.4% or more. ""We are deep in the second wave,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""I think that this year's Christmas will be a different Christmas."" In a televised address on Wednesday, Mr Macron said that France must now ""brutally apply the brakes"" to avoid being ""submerged by the acceleration of the epidemic"". ""The virus is circulating at a speed that not even the most pessimistic forecasts had anticipated,"" he said, adding that half of all intensive care beds at French hospitals were being occupied by Covid patients. The president said that under the new rules, people would need to fill in a form to justify leaving their homes, as was required in the initial lockdown in March. Social gatherings are banned. ""Like in the spring, you will be able to leave your house only to work, for a medical appointment, to provide assistance to a relative, to shop for essential goods or to go for a walk near your house,"" Mr Macron said. But he made clear that public services and factories would remain open, adding that the economy ""must not stop or collapse"". Mr Macron added that visits to care homes - which were banned during the two-month lockdown declared in March - would be permitted under the latest measures. The curbs will apply until 1 December and will be reassessed every two weeks. The president said he retained ""hope that families will be able to be reunited for Christmas"". The French government has been taken by surprise by the virulence of this second Covid wave. Some 50,000 new cases a day are being reported and that's probably a big underestimate. The proportion of critical beds occupied by Covid patients is now 70% in Paris. The new restrictions announced by President Macron on Wednesday are similar to measures introduced in March, but with some key differences. For business, it's going to be another massive blow - especially for sectors like entertainment and events. The president promised help for French firms, but did not provide details. After the economy picked up in the third quarter, it now looks inevitable that it'll contract again between now and the end of the year, and for the whole of 2020 the government's predicting a 10% fall in GDP. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country had to ""act now"" and called for a ""major national effort"" to fight the spread of coronavirus. While Germany has a lower infection rate than many other parts of Europe, the speed with which the virus has been spreading in recent weeks has alarmed Berlin. ""Our health system can still cope with this challenge today, but at this speed of infection it will reach the limits of its capacity within weeks,"" Mrs Merkel said. This video can not be played Europe's streets empty A partial lockdown will now begin in Germany on 2 November, under terms agreed by Mrs Merkel and the 16 state premiers: Schools and kindergartens will remain open Social contacts will be limited to two households with a maximum of 10 people and tourism will be halted Bars will close and restaurants will be limited to takeaways Tattoo and massage parlours will shut Smaller companies badly hit by the lockdown will be reimbursed with up to 75% of their November 2019 takings Mrs Merkel and the state premiers are expected to reconvene by video conference on 11 November to reassess the situation The chancellor said the measures were necessary to avoid a national emergency. The German government is keen to enable families and friends to meet at Christmas, but daily infections have soared to a new high of 14,964, with 85 more deaths reported in the latest 24-hour period.

"President Trump mocked mask-wearing mandates at a rally in Arizona on Wednesday President Donald Trump has urged states to shun lockdowns as his Democratic rival Joe Biden said the pandemic could not be stopped by ""flipping a switch"". Continuing a whirlwind schedule of rallies in battleground states, Mr Trump also mocked mask mandates. Mr Biden said Mr Trump's handling of America's worsening coronavirus crisis was an ""insult"" to its victims. The Democrat has a solid national lead over the Republican president six days before the 3 November election. But Mr Biden's advantage is narrower in the handful of US states that could vote either way and ultimately decide who wins the White House. This video can not be played ""Well, we just voted"": Joe Biden has cast his ballot early in Delaware More than 75 million Americans have voted early, nearly 50 million of them by post, in a record-breaking voting surge driven by the pandemic. Virus deaths are rising in 39 US states and an average of about 800 people are dying daily nationwide. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? A really simple guide to the US election The other US election that's hugely important White House coronavirus task force expert Dr Anthony Fauci told the BBC on Wednesday that Mr Trump's political rallies were bound to spread Covid-19. He said gatherings of people not wearing masks or socially distancing were potentially superspreading events. This video can not be played Can we believe the polls this time? Infection rates are alsorising sharply across Europe, including in the UK, France and Germany. Global stock markets plunged on Wednesdayamid fears that the pandemic could reverse tepid economic recoveries. The two presidential rivals' divisions over the coronavirus were on stark display once again on Wednesday. Speaking from his home of Wilmington, Delaware, Democrat Joe Biden said he would not campaign ""on the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch"". Mr Biden - who has not ruled out further lockdowns - pledged instead to ""let science drive our decisions"". ""Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,"" he said. ""I do promise this: We will start on day one doing the right things."" This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins He also railed against Mr Trump's attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in the midst of a pandemic. The Democrat and his wife Jill Biden cast their early ballots soon afterwards. Mr Trump voted early on Saturday in Florida. At a rally in Goodyear, Arizona, Mr Trump warned that a Biden presidency would lead to more lockdowns and economic misery for Americans. ""If you vote for Joe Biden it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no thanksgivings, no Christmas, and no Fourth of July together. ""Other than that you'll have a wonderful life. Can't see anybody, but that's alright."" This video can not be played Nigel Farage praises Trump at Arizona rally, calling him the ""bravest person I have ever met"" He cast the election as ""a choice between a Trump super-recovery and a Biden depression"". At an earlier rally in Bullhead City, also in Arizona, a state where looser rules on social distancing make staging crowded events easier, Mr Trump poked fun at mask mandates in Democratic-run states. An F-16 fighter jet was scrambled during the rally to ward off an aircraft that entered the air space without authorisation. The warplane fired flares to get the pilot's attention and the smaller aircraft was escorted out of the area without further incident, according to the North American Aerospace Command. The mid-air interception caught the notice of the president, who looked up at the roaring jet and said: ""I love that sound."" At every rally stop on this multi-state, cross-country campaign swing, Donald Trump - in his words and in his actions - is trying to convince the country that the coronavirus pandemic is on the verge of being ""vanquished"". At times, he warns that the cure - aggressive mitigation efforts - cannot be worse than the disease. At others, he downplays the severity of the pandemic. ""I caught it,"" he told the crowd at one of his Arizona rallies. ""And then you get better. And then you get immune."" Sometimes he boasts about the effectiveness of his response and how, if he hadn't acted, two million Americans would have died (this is a number experts say would have been approached only if the government had done nothing at all). Donald Trump is reaching for a way to address a cold truth - that opinion polls indicate the public believes the coronavirus pandemic is the most pressing issue facing the nation, and the president is not doing a good enough job in handling it. With only five days before the election, and with 75 million Americans having voted so far, time is running out for the president to change minds. But in a relentless string of rallies, by dint of sheer determination and endurance, he seems determined to try. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election The US Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that voting officials in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, two key battleground states, could accept postal ballots for several days after the general election in an outcome that cheered Democrats. In the North Carolina case, the justices allowed lower court decisions to stand that permitted the state board of elections to extend the deadline for accepting ballots to nine days after the vote. The highest US court also declined to decide before election day whether Pennsylvania election officials can continue receiving votes for three days after the vote. The court's new justice, Amy Coney Barrett, did not take part in either case. Meanwhile, a study by the US Center for Responsive Politics projected the total cost of this US general election would hit $14bn (Â£10.7bn), double the cost of the last one.

Nottingham had thehighest figures in the UKearlier this month, but its seven-day rate of infection has dropped again, according to the latest data. The city had the 23rd highest rate of infection per 100,000 people in England, at 451.5, in the week to 25 October - down from 611 the previous week. Mansfield's seven-day infection rate is currently at 349.5 cases per 100,000 people. Mansfield's Conservative MP Ben Bradley, who previously opposed his constituency moving into tier three, said ""big rises in cases in the north of the county"" meant it was hard to argue with the tightening of restrictions.

The measures were revealed as it was confirmed the whole county would move into tier three at 00:01 on Friday. Alcohol cannot be sold after 21:00 GMT in shops, but can be sold until 22:00 if bought ""in hospitality venues where accompanying a substantial meal"". Hotels can remain open, as can gyms and leisure centres. Nottingham, Rushcliffe, Gedling and Broxtowehad been expected to move into the top tier of Covid restrictions on Thursday. While the tier three status has been delayed for 24 hours, it will now include the entire county. Other tier three rules include: Fitness and dance studios, sports courts and swimming pools can also remain open, although it is ""strongly advised"" group indoor classes do not take place Public buildings such as community centres, libraries and town halls are allowed to remain open to run activities such as childcare and support groups, but not for private hire, birthday parties and other social events ""Indoor entertainment and tourism venues"" have to close, but cinemas, concert halls, ice rinks and theatres are not affected by the new rules.

"Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have advised local social clubs they can serve alcohol without food An apparent loophole in government rules has caused confusion over whether social clubs are subject to tier three Covid restrictions on serving alcohol. Pubs and barsin tier threemust close unless they serve substantial meals. But some social clubs are continuing to serve alcohol to members without a substantial meal after their local councils told them it was permitted. The government said social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they serve substantial meals. There are thousands of members clubs across England, including Conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde have all advised social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. The tier three regulations,external, which came into effect earlier this month, appeared not to include private members clubs because they operate under a different law which means, in effect, the members own the drink already. Preston Council posted advice,externalstating membership based social clubs ""do not sell alcohol, instead they supply alcohol to their members"". ""Therefore the requirement to close does not apply to these premises and nor do these premises need to provide a substantial meal to club members or their guests when they are drinking"". The British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive Emma McClarkin said the organisation was ""aware of this inconsistency and are raising it with government to get clarity"". ""Given the circumstances they find themselves in, it is vital, more than ever, that pubs have a level-playing field with clear guidance,"" she added. Mill Hill Working Men's Club in Blackburnposted on Facebook,externalthat it is planning to reopen on Friday, prompting some to celebrate and others to condemn the move. Blackburn with Darwen has the highest rate of new cases of Covid-19 in England, with 1,176 new cases recorded in the seven days to October 23 - the equivalent of 785.6 cases per 100,000 people. What are the social distancing rules? Halloween: Can we go trick or treating or not? What Covid tier is your area in? 'I'll be hosting my Christmas over Zoom' One person commented on the post, saying: ""Surely can't be able to open without selling substantial meals. If this is allowed it will without doubt open a can of worms. If clubs can open then why not pubs?"" Another said: ""Out of respect for other publicans you should stay shut"". Club owners responded to one of the comments, saying: ""Please read the statement! We contacted the Council!"" Blackburn with Darwen Council said it is ""awaiting urgent clarification"" from government ""and will provide an update as soon as possible"". Wallasey Conservative Club treasurer Charlie White, 75, said he was ""happy to re-open"" and ""didn't agree with being locked down in the first place"". He said the Wirral club has all the Covid measures in place and is safe but that he thinks the loophole is ""likely to be closed soon"". The Association of Conservative Clubs (ACC) noted the confusion,externalon its website but said it does not consider this interpretation of the rules to be ""the government's intention"". The ACC, which represents more than 800 clubs, said ""the legislation could be amended in the future to close this 'loop hole'"". It is unclear whether social clubs choosing to remain closed will receive the enhanced tier three financial support packages. The ACC said it ""will be heavily pushing"" for such clubs to get the enhanced support ""even if the actual legislation has become muddled"" about whether it had to close. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are asking everybody to play their part to reduce potential periods of exposure in an indoor environment. ""For areas in very high local alert levels, any pub, bar or other business, including social or members clubs, cannot sell alcohol for consumption on the premises unless it is served alongside a substantial meal."" On Saturday, South Yorkshire joined Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Liverpool City Region in the highest level. Warrington moved into tier three on Tuesday and will be followed by Nottinghamshire on Friday. THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"Financial markets have tumbled around the world for a second day this week amid concerns that a rise in coronavirus cases will hurt still tentative economic recoveries. Major US indexes sank 3.4% or more, while European bourses also saw steep falls. The UK's FTSE 100 ended almost 2.6% lower, and Germany's Dax dropped 4.2%. The declines were widespread, as investors sold-off shares in favour of less risky assets like the US dollar. In the US, travel and energy firms, which are sensitive to concerns about the pandemic, suffered some of the steepest losses. Tech companies were also hit. Shares in Google, Facebook and Twitter all slid more than 5%, as their bosses were grilled by senators in Washington about how the firms should moderate speech on their platforms. The negative sentiment spilled over into Asian markets on Thursday with Australia's ASX 200 down 1.6% while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index slipped 1.2%. However, these falls were modest compared to US and European bourses. In the UK, mining companies on the FTSE 100 took a hit, while on France's CAC 40 index, which dropped 3.4%, carmaker Renault was the biggest loser with an 8% drop. The declines mark a second day of steep falls this week, which has seen many countries report record numbers of new coronavirus cases, leading to strains in health systems and fresh lockdown restrictions in France and Germany. Coronavirus: Macron declares second national lockdown in France The Dow closed 3.4% lower, shedding more than 900 points to end at a level last seen in late July. The wider S&P 500 and Nasdaq retreated to September levels, falling 3.5% and 3.7% respectively. By contrast, financial markets in Asia, where the virus is seen as being under better control, have fared better. On Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng indexes closed down about 0.3%. In the US, investors are also on edge ahead of a close US presidential election. A defeat of current President Donald Trump could lead to tougher regulation for some sectors, including technology and oil and gas.

"Claire Parry died in hospital after being strangled, the court heard A police officer who strangled a mother of two after she exposed their affair to his wife has been jailed. Timothy Brehmer killed nurse Claire Parry, 41, after they met in a pub car park in Dorset on 9 May. The two had been involved in a secret relationship for more than 10 years, a trial at Salisbury Crown Court heard. Brehmer, 41, who admitted manslaughter andwas acquitted of murder by a jury on Tuesday, has been jailed for 10 and a half years. The trial heard Mrs Parry, who was married to another Dorset Police officer, met the defendant outside the Horns Inn in West Parley to confront him about another of his extra-marital affairs. Mrs Parry took hold of his phone before sending a text to his wife, saying: ""I am cheating on you."" Brehmer, of Hordle, Hampshire, said he had strangled Mrs Parry by accident during a ""kerfuffle"" in his car and that his arm ""must have slipped in all the melee"". Mrs Parry, from Bournemouth, died in hospital the following day from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck. Timothy Brehmer admitted killing Claire Parry but told the court it was an accident Mr Justice Jacobs told Brehmer he was sentencing him ""on the basis you lost your self-control following the sending of the text message to your wife where the affair was revealed, rather than on the basis that you had no intention to kill or cause really serious harm"". ""I am sure that you did deliberately take Claire Parry by the neck applying significant force with your forearm or the crook of your elbow for a period of time while she struggled against you, thereby causing...severe neck injuries,"" the judge added. ""The evidence from the pathologist was that those injuries which she described as 'severe' on a scale of mild, moderate or severe resulted from the application of significant force to the neck for a period of a minimum 10 to 30 seconds and possibly longer. ""She said it was difficult to envisage a situation where a struggle in the car imparted the necessary degree of force or could explain the extent and severity of the neck injuries."" This video can not be played Police body-worn video showed Brehmer ""crying hysterically"" after killing his lover Brehmer told the trial he had left the car without realising Mrs Parry was ""poorly"". However, the judge said as a trained police officer ""it must have been obvious"" that Mrs Parry was not breathing. ""Yet you did nothing to try to help Claire Parry,"" Mr Justice Jacobs added. ""You did not ask her how she was. That was because you knew how she was. ""You could not possibly have thought, as you said in your police interview, that she was simply taking a breath. ""You must have known that her body had gone limp after your assault on her. ""Before you walked to the car park entrance you must have seen how she was - hanging half out of the car."" Mrs Parry's husband, Andrew, said he was ""incredibly disappointed"" with the verdict and branded Brehmer a ""well-practised liar"". ""He has shown himself - as the trial exposed - to be consistently dishonest, deceitful and devious,"" he added. ""Claire was a caring nurse practitioner who helped many people in a career of over 20 years. She was a loving family member and a doting mother who leaves behind two young children. ""Her energy and enthusiasm for life were infectious and our lives are poorer without her in them."" Mr Parry previously told the court Brehmer was the ""worst kind of thief"" anddescribed the pain of telling their children that their mother was dead. ""It was like a physical weight crushing down on my chest,"" he said. Dorset Police said Brehmer had been sacked at a misconduct meeting held on 16 September. He was also placed on the national police barred list. Chief Constable James Vaughan said for a serving officer ""to take the life of another in this way is incomprehensible"".
