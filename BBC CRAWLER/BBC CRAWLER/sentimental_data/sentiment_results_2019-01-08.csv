"US President Donald Trump is set to argue that an immigration ""crisis"" requires his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. Mr Trump will make his case in his first speech from the Oval Office at 21:00EST (0200 GMT Wednesday), ahead of a trip to the border on Thursday. A partial government shutdown has been in effect for 17 days after lawmakers failed to break a budget impasse. The president is insisting that $5bn (Â£4bn) be included for the border wall. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? The impact of the government shutdown Shutdown 'embarrassing' to US tech industry White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a tweet that Mr Trump would use his visit to the border on Thursday to ""meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis"". Ahead of the speech on Tuesday, Vice-President Mike Pence said Mr Trump's decision to address the nation ""comes from this president's deep desire to do his job to protect the American people"". Donald Trump says there is a growing crisis along the US-Mexico border that demands immediate and drastic action. The challenge for Mr Trump is that he has been calling for a wall - a bigger, longer one - since he announced his presidential bid in 2015. That has made it hard for his opponents to believe there is a new situation that requires the same solution, except smaller and shorter. What's more, administration officials have been vague - perhaps intentionally - on the numbers supporting their claims. They say 4,000 ""terrorists"" have been caught entering the US, but it turns out most stops happen at airports. There have been only a handful apprehended at the Mexican border (fewer than at the border with Canada). The White House has recently painted this as a humanitarian problem - and Central American families are, in fact, fleeing poverty and violence. But can he make the case that a wall is the humanitarian answer, and not just a way of making refugee suffering less visible to Americans? The president must convince a sceptical public that his wall is worth the pain the shutdown is causing government workers and the nation at large. He has eight minutes on Tuesday to do it. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall The decision by the major US TV networks to set aside at least eight minutes of airtime for the speech has sparked controversy and fuelled debate on social media. Critics pointed out that the networks aired President George W Bush's prime-time address on immigration in 2006, but did not air one by President Barack Obama in 2014. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on Tuesday that they would deliver a joint rebuttal from the halls of Congress after Mr Trump has spoken. Some reporters have called on the White House to provide the text of his remarks in advance to be fact-checked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, living former US presidents disputed Mr Trump's claim that some of them had privately told him they regretted not building a border wall during their administrations. ""I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue,"" former President Jimmy Carter said in a statement issued by the Carter Center on Monday. A spokesman for George W Bush said he had never discussed the border wall with Mr Trump. A representative for Bill Clinton denied it and said that the two men had not spoken since Mr Trump took office, according to CBS. Mr Obama has not explicitly denied Mr Trump's claim, but has extensively campaigned against the president on the issue. In Mr Pence's interview with NBC on Tuesday,external, he sought to clarify the president's original claim, saying ""that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents"". ""I know I've seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security, the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration,"" he added. Mr Trump will visit the US-Mexico border on Thursday The White House has been under fire amid a partial government shutdown, which began on 22 December and affects a quarter of the government. Some 800,000 federal employees have been temporarily laid off - or are working without pay. Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior and the Treasury. US media are reporting that Mr Trump will not declare a national emergency on Tuesday evening, in a bid to launch construction of a wall by circumventing Congress. US law allows the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from defence department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes,the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says. Such a move would prompt members of Congress who are tasked with allocating tax money - including some Republicans - to push back, he says. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president in 2016. During the campaign for the mid-term elections in November 2018, he repeatedly warned of a ""caravan"" of Central American migrants making its way towards the US-Mexico border. In a reaction that many saw as a political ploy during a campaign season, he deployed 5,800 US troops to the border due to what he described as an ""invasion"". Last month, Mr Trump suggested that the US military could be used to build the wall. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Departures at Heathrow were temporarily stopped after a drone was reported to have been sighted. Flights from the west London airport resumed about an hour after police said a drone had been seen. A Heathrow spokeswoman had said it was a ""precautionary measure"" to ""prevent any threat to operational safety"". It comes after last month's disruption at Gatwick Airport which saw thousands of people stranded when drones were sighted. How can a drone cause so much chaos? New powers to tackle illegal drone use The spokeswoman said Heathrow was working with Air Traffic Control and the Metropolitan Police following the incident. ""We continue to monitor this situation and apologise to any passengers that were affected by this disruption,"" she said. British Airways aircraft were among those sitting on the tarmac waiting to depart The Metropolitan Police said they received reports of a drone sighting near Heathrow at about 17:05 GMT. Before the confirmation that flights had resumed,Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said,externalhe was in contact with the airport about the drone sighting, and had spoken to the home secretary and defence secretary. BBC cameraman Martin Roberts said he was driving on the M25 past Heathrow airport at about 17:45 GMT when he saw what he believes was a drone. ""I could see, I'd say around 300 feet up, very bright, stationary flashing red and green lights, over the Harmondsworth area,"" he said. ""I could tell it was a drone - these things have got quite distinctive lights - not a helicopter. ""The lights were very close together. It was a very clear night and the object was stationary, it was turning very, very slightly. I could see it very clearly, I'd say for about four to five minutes."" by Alice Evans, BBC London A couple of hours after the first reports of a drone in the skies above Heathrow, it was business as usual in the Terminal 5 departure lounge - in a low blow to Gatwick, one member of staff told me it's because ""we're a good airport"". Although flights were up and running again pretty quickly, there are still plenty of passengers who have faced disruption tonight. One of those is Catriona Walsh, who was on a flight from Basel. Ms Walsh, who was doing a couple of days of work despite being on maternity leave, said she won't get to her final stop in Wales for another couple of hours now that she has missed her train. Her flight was held on the runway for about 50 minutes as staff told passengers about the drone. ""It was all calm - frustrating rather than worrying,"" she said. Michael, a fellow passenger on the flight who did not want to provide his surname, was less optimistic. ""I was worried I might have to camp here,"" he said. He said the problems here and at Gatwick have shown ""exactly how to shut a country - this country - down"", adding that police need to ""just shoot drones down"" as soon as they are sighted. Passengers stuck at Heathrow expressed their frustration at having to wait to depart while the airport responded to the sighting. Jack Whittle, whose flight to Manchester was grounded, said the aircraft was ""freezing"" and ""babies were screaming everywhere"". ""Elderly people are getting blankets, but nobody else,"" he told BBC News at the time. Travel expert Simon Calder said the temporary halting of departures would have a knock-on effect. ""They will now be able to start getting away, but all that time you have had arrivals coming in and gates not being available because departing planes haven't gone. It's going to be messy for the rest of the evening,"" he told the BBC. Mr Calder said Heathrow had measures in place intended to prevent this kind of incident. ""Heathrow told me that they had actually provided equipment and personnel to help their big rival Gatwick out during the drone event,"" he said. More than 140,000 passengers at Gatwick were affected during 36 hours of chaos between 19 and 21 December. About 1,000 flights were cancelled there over three days due to the drone sightings. Gatwick said last weekthat it had spent Â£5m to prevent future attacks. Heathrow also confirmed it would be buying systems to guard against drones. Andit was announced this weekthat police would be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones. John Grant, industry advisor to air travel data specialists OAG, told the BBC it was ""almost inevitable"" after what happened at Gatwick that there would be ""a heightened state of awareness and these types of incidents could possibly reoccur"".

"The military is helping police after sightings of a drone temporarily halted flights at Heathrow airport on Tuesday. Scotland Yard said a ""full criminal investigation"" had been launched into the incident - and that officers were among those to see the drone. Departures from the west London airport were suspended for about an hour. It comes after thousands of passengers were caught up in disruption at Gatwick Airport last month following reports of drone sightings. Heathrow airport, which is also working with the Met Police, said it was monitoring the situation and apologised to passengers affected by the disruption. Speaking on Wednesday morning, the airport said ""business was back to normal"". How can a drone cause so much chaos? New powers to tackle illegal drone use The Met's Commander Stuart Cundy confirmed military assistance had been brought in but would not discuss tactics in detail. He said the drone sighting was reported just after 17:00 GMT, with departing flights stopped as a precaution while initial inquiries were made. ""We are carrying out extensive searches around the Heathrow area to identify any people who may be responsible for the operation of the drone,"" he said. ""The illegal operation of drones at an airfield is extremely dangerous."" Heathrow is one of the busiest airports in the world Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said,externalduring the incident that he was in contact with the airport about the drone sighting, and had spoken to the home secretary and defence secretary. BBC cameraman Martin Roberts, who works with drones, said he was driving on the M25 past Heathrow airport at about 17:45 GMT when he saw what he believes was a drone.

Heathrow also confirmed it would be buying systems to guard against drones. Andit was announced this weekthat police would be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones. In light of the Heathrow incident, British Airline Pilots' Association general secretary Brian Strutton called on ministers to further strengthen drone legislation and to ensure airports invested in protection technology. ""It's time to act swiftly and decisively,"" he added. Speaking to ITV, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said: ""Clearly, the government is looking at the law to see whether there are ways in which it could be strengthened."" He added that airports also needed to ""step up"" investment in technology to detect and stop drones from flying. BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said while the ""significant"" incident did not cause the same disruption as at Gatwick, it raised the question of how UK airports can deal with drones. While they are looking at the latest technology, it is clear they are ""playing catch-up"" he said - adding that the aviation industry had been calling for ""drastic action on this for months"".

"The novel tool produces more finely-grained weather reports A weather forecasting system that can provide hourly updates for any location on the planet has been announced by technology giant IBM. Currently in many African, Asian and South American countries, weather reports may be available only every six to 12 hours and only for broad patches of land up to 15km (9.3 miles) wide. But IBM's new tool provides reports down to more specific, 3km-wide areas. The company says it can even predict individual thunderstorms. The tool, announced at the CES tech show in Las Vegas and launched in partnership with The Weather Channel, uses supercomputers to crunch data from hundreds of millions of sensors around the globe. ""The scale is almost incomprehensible to people - from a compute and complexity point of view,"" Cameron Clayton, at IBM, told BBC News. ""A farmer in Kansas has really good weather [forecasts] today but a farmer in Kenya only gets a weather forecast once, maybe twice, a day - they'll now get it hourly."" More from CES 2019: Samsung adds rival Apple's iTunes to smart TVs The backseat VR that moves with the car CES 2019: Preparing for take-off Mr Clayton said the Global High-Resolution Atmospheric Forecasting System (Graf) had been designed to gather data from a wide variety of sensors - including millions of smartphones equipped with atmospheric pressure sensors. Graf relies on data from around the world - much of it supplied by individuals whose smartphones measure atmospheric pressure Tracking changes in pressure is crucial in meteorology, the study of weather processes and forecasting. But besides this crowdsourced data from members of the public, Graf will also analyse information from thousands of commercial flights. Instruments on planes measure weather conditions and phenomena such as turbulence. In the future, as weather sensors crop up in additional devices and vehicles, manufacturers will have the option of sharing yet more data with IBM to improve Graf. IBM is clearly interested in consolidating its position within the weather forecasting industry, according to Brandon Purcell, an analyst at market research company Forrester. IBM acquired The Weather Company, which runs The Weather Channel, in 2016. ""They really haven't made the best use of their acquisition of The Weather Company until now - this seems like a step in the right direction,"" he said. Farmers in many parts of the world have long had to rely on infrequently updated weather reports Mr Purcell pointed out that gaining access to lots of data could greatly improve the accuracy of forecasts and might put IBM ahead of its rivals in the space. He added that, having served as aPeace Corps,externalvolunteer in sub-Saharan Africa, he could personally vouch for the fact that more frequent weather updates could be transformative in the region. ""That would resonate to me - the fact that you could get really high-resolution data to farmers who haven't had access to good weather forecasts. That's potentially huge,"" he said.

"MPs continue debate on the governmentâs Brexit deal They will vote on whether to approve the deal next Tuesday MPs usually debate private members' bills on a Friday Richard Morris, Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says the PM should strike 29 March as Brexit day from UK law if her deal is voted down. House of CommonsParliament With the completion of the debate on Brexit, the Commons adjourns until next week. On Monday, the Brexit debate continues after questions and any urgent questions or statements. Then, on Tuesday, it's the final day of debate followed by the big vote on whether or not Parliament approves the agreement reached between the UK and EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that the government ""has made it clear"" that EU citizens rights will be protected whether or not the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he thinks that he agrees with Julia Lopez, who said that people will no longer trust politicians if Brexit is not delivered. He urges Labour MPs to ""stop playing games"" and reminds them that leave-voting Labour members will ""never forgive them"" if they try to stop Brexit. He adds that there will be no limit on the number of international students who can study in the UK. He concludes by saying that ""we are now in the final stages"" of leaving an organisation which ""has been central to our national life for 46 years"". ""Let us rise to the moment,"" he finishes. With that, the Commons moves on to the adjournment debate. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says that maybe it's the flu she's suffering, but the debate seems to have a remarkable air of ""deja vu"" about it. She says that the prime minister is ""running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit"" and she says there is ""nothing new"" to this document that has changed since 5 December. ""This deal jeopardises all the co-operation we've come to rely with the EU,"" she states. She says that the deal ""cedes control to Europe"" on many areas of UK law. ""Nothing has been achieved from five weeks of delay,"" she adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mike Gapes says it was the Labour government of Tony Blair which made ""such an impact"" on the development of the European Union. In 1975 he says he was putting out anti-Common Market leaflets the day before a Cambridge final exam, ""the Labour Party is in a bizarre position...we are going for a sensible Brexit,"" but he adds, ""there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage"". He says he doesn't believe that any government would be able to negotiate anything different to what has been proposed. He'll be voting to stay in the European Union if the Commons gets the chance, he adds. 'Rebelling with a heavy heart' Conservative Michael Tomlinson says his constituents have been saying for ""a number of months"" that they just want ""to get on with it"". He adds that the proposal ""does not get on with it"". He says that it is not ""taking back control"". He states that while the UK will not be subject to the CJEU, it will still have ""leverage"" in the UK, and he describes the court as ""highly political"". ""The proposal threatens the integrity"" of the UK, he continues. ""I have never rebelled against the government...and I do so with a heavy heart, but with a clear head,"" he adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Julia Lopez says that the political class ""could soon find itself despised"" if it does not do what has been requested in the referendum. The agreement will lead to another ""two years"" of ""discord and indecision"" from warring factions. The UK will ""have given up all our negotiating leverage"", she adds. Labour's Martin Whitfield says ""the big problem is"" that there is no plan for where the country is going. ""Once upon a time were told we'd hold all the cards, and it would be easy,"" he states. He says that ""there is no disrespect in re-evaluating"" a decision when the facts become known. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Another Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones says he will also be supporting the prime minister's deal, saying it best represents the desire of the people he represents. He says he and his constituents want to ""get on with it"". Labour's Thangam Debbonaire says she wants an immigration system that Remain and Leave voters can trust. She says she does not believe anyone will be satisfied with the government's proposed immigration system. ""I want to talk about immigration,"" she says. ""I want to see an improved response to refugees...but I don't think I've come across anyone who thinks our current system is working well."" EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning says he will not ""Vote for anything that doesn't protect the union"". He calls on the PM to return to the EU to ""sort the backstop out"". Next is Labour MP Ian Murray, who says there are 77 days to go and ""the stakes could not be higher"". He calls on the government to rule out a no-deal scenario. He says the prime minister has united Leavers and Remainers against the deal, by sticking to the red lines she set down. He calls for a 'People's Vote' on the deal. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative Kemi Badenoch says she will be supporting the prime minister's deal. She says the guarantees it gives on citizens' rights are important, and asks how MPs could vote against the deal, opening the possibility of no-deal and therefore the loss of citizens' rights. Labour MP Stephen Pound says he was ""seduced"" by Margaret Thatcher and voted to join the European Union. He says the EU set global standards for decency, human rights, freedom and environmental legislation. If we leave the EU on 29 March this year, we must make sure our European brothers and sisters know that we will work with them. ""We will not stop being Europeans,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative James Duddridge says in voting against the deal he feels he is representing his constituents. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick says the issue has become toxic, as shown by what has been happening outside and inside Parliament this week. Conservative MP Anna Soubry wassubjected to abusefrom protesters as she did broadcast interviews this week, and other MPs have been on the receiving end of abuse and harassment. He says he is talking himself into talking Theresa May's deal, because of the danger of a no-deal. We're covering today's debate in the Commons - unusually it's being held on a Friday - and we'll have live page coverage of Monday and Tuesday's debates too. If you want to know more about Parliament, and look at every day's order paper, you should visitParliament's website,external. And, of course, the official record of parliamentary proceedings arerecorded in Hansard,external. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to stop a no-deal Brexit by backing another referendum. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Rosindell says that his constituents voted 70% to leave, and that nothing has changed their minds. ""I truly believe that our nation is up for this,"" he says. Labour's Matt Western says he ""cannot vote for any deal that will lead to people being worse off"". He says that Parliament is ""seeing the work of an autocratic tendency"" in the prime minister, ""this is not a debate, it is neither leadership,"" he states, referring to how Mrs May says that it is either her deal or no deal. But Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to ""stop people committing national suicide"". EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says that she was elected to try to stop Brexit. She says she is regularly stopped in the street by constituents who tell her they ""want an end to this mess"". ""We have to be honest with them,"" she says. ""Brexit isn't going to solve"" any of the issues that caused people to vote for it. ""Poll after poll shows that the will of the people has changed since 2016,"" she says, adding that there was breaking of electoral law. ""People should be allowed to change their mind,"" she adds. She says that MPs must ask themselves if this new deal is better than the deal we already have from the EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir David Amess says he is ""heartily sick of the word Brexit"" and is ""less than pleased"" on how the UK has gone about trying to leave the EU. ""There are a number of reasons why I cannot support this agreement,"" one of them being ""because it threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom"", he says. Labour's Jo Stevens says she will be voting against the deal with the ""overwhelming support"" of her constituents. She says that in the past month nothing has changed, like over the past two years of negotiations. ""The referendum was drenched in illegality by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns,"" she adds. The result of the referendum does not apply ""in perpetuity"", she says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Mark Francois says that anyone who would call Remain-supporting MP Sir Nicholas Soames ""a traitor"" ""has clearly never met him"". Anyone who calls him that should ""go away and shut up"", he says. He states that he has been ""fairly consistent"" on European matters during his parliamentary career, in speaking against the EU. He says that the ""political declaration"" is ""legally completely meaningless"", and he adds that it is the ""legal equivalent of 'I promise I will respect you in the morning'"". He adds that he is ""utterly determined to vote against"" the deal. Having just been through ""considerable austerity"" it is wrong to pay Â£39bn to the EU for a deal with ""no guarantees"", he states. The UK is also not ""taking back control of our laws"" as the UK still has to ""obey EU laws"" but has lost the ability to influence them, under the deal, he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Luciana Berger says that few of the debates in the Commons have ever had ""such an impact"" on all constituents across the country. She accuses the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" of no deal or May's deal. ""It is beyond reproach that this [no deal] option has not been ruled out,"" she criticises the government for spending money on no deal preparations. Constituents will no longer be covered by EU Health Insurance Cards when they go abroad, she states. The NHS ""will suffer as we are are unable to properly recruit from EU countries"", she adds. A no-deal Brexit would ""isolate and hobble Britain's universities"", she says. There are 1.4m young people who are eligible to vote today who weren't before, 74% of her constituents wants a People's Vote, she states. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The crashes happened 90 minutes apart on the same carriageway A 14-year-old boy and a woman have died in a motorway crash. The collision between junctions 3 and 4 of the M58 in Lancashire involved seven vehicles, including an HGV and a minibus. A man in his 60s suffered serious injuries and a second teenager is also being treated in hospital. The HGV's driver, a 31-year-old man from Chorley, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A woman in her 90s and two men were also seriously hurt in a second crash on the same road 90 minutes later. Nine people were injured in both crashes, police said. 'Crumpled up' Motorist Andy Unsworth, who drove past the site of the first crash about a minute after the crash, described the scene as ""carnage"". He reported seeing ""tyre burns on the road"" and one vehicle ""off the road in the ditch"". ""It was only as the traffic passed that you could see the other vehicles and the full extent of the accident,"" he said. ""What presumably used to be some sort of people carrier was crumpled up. Both ends of the vehicle were gone. The scene was carnage. ""It looked like a dozen people or so were standing along damaged vehicles facing different directions on the hard shoulder. ""There was debris everywhere and the scale of it made you instantly know how serious it was."" Highways England said both carriageways will be closed for several hours Ch Insp Damian Kitchen of Lancashire Police said that the cause of the first crash had not yet been established but stressed that ""driving conditions were fine"". Dog walker Helen Green Purnell, a pharmacy assistant from Skelmersdale, saw the aftermath of the crash. ""There was a white van that had fallen down in to the ditch. The air ambulances were flying around,"" said the 48-year-old. ""It looked very serious."" A spokesman for Allied Scaffolding, which owns a truck visible in pictures from the scene of the fatal crash, said: ""We are fully aware of the situation and it is related to our company. ""We are in full co-operation with the police and authorities and will give them our full support. ""Our main concern at this stage is for those involved in the crash."" Allied Scaffolding said it was co-operating with police The second crash, also on the westbound carriageway, happened just before 10:15 GMT and involved an HGV, a van and a car. In a tweet, Aintree Hospital said its Accident and Emergency department was ""dealing with patients involved in a serious road traffic accident"" and advised people to expect longer waiting times.

"Jaden Moodie lived in the area with his mother, police said A 14-year-old boy has been stabbed to death by attackers who knocked him off a moped, in what police believe was a targeted attack. Jaden Moodie was found wounded in Bickley Road, Waltham Forest, at 18:30 GMT on Tuesday. Detectives believe the moped had been involved in a crash with a car, after which three men got out the vehicle, stabbed the teenager and drove off. He died at the scene. No arrests have been made and a cordon is in place. Jaden, who police said lived in the area with his mother, is believed to be the youngest victim to die on London's streets in the past year. There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008. There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008 Jaden's godmother described him as ""full of life, fun loving and a ray of sunshine"". Zoe Grant, from Nottingham, said the teenager and his mother had recently moved to London from the East Midlands to be closer to some of his family. ""He was a beautiful boy, so intelligent and had everything to live for,"" she said. ""He went to London and then this happens, it's just so unfair. The violence in London is out of hand, it's not right."" Marcellus Baz, who was Jaden's youth worker when he lived in Nottingham, said he found the news of the schoolboy's death ""absolutely shocking"". ""He was a polite kid, he was really respectful. He's a good kid,"" he said. Police are appealing for witnesses The minimum age to drive a moped in the UK is 16 Det Ch Insp Larry Smith, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""Everything that we have learned about this attack so far indicates it was targeted and intent on lethal force from the outset. ""We are doing everything we can to catch those who carried out this cowardly attack and bring them to justice."" A section 60 order has been put in place, allowing officers to search anyone in the vicinity of the scene for weapons. Motives and circumstances behind killings varied - as did the age and gender of the victims. Faces of London's dead: All the victims of 2018 How the capital's bloody year unfolded Police have not said whether they believe the murder was gang-related but all lines of inquiry remain open. Officers are trying to trace the vehicle used in the attack, which is believed to be a black Mercedes B Class with extensive frontal damage. Floral tributes were left on Lea Bridge Road, near the scene of the crime Kerry-Ann Honeygahn said she ""wasn't surprised"" to hear of the latest violence Kerry-Ann Honeygahn told the BBC how a few weeks ago, her friend took a knife away from the boy. The 38-year-old youth mentor said she ""wasn't surprised"" to hear of the violence. ""Another young life has been taken on the streets of London."" There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008 Around the corner from the crime scene is a narrow street with several garages. Mechanics there say the boy used to come by for a chat, riding on a moped with another boy - thought to be either his friend or his brother. Garage owner Anthony Anderson said he felt like a father figure to the ""nice little boy"" and was ""very sad"" to hear he had died. ""I used to encourage him to go to school, to stay out of trouble. He used to chat to me about growing up."" The 56-year-old, who has two children and worries ""what will happen next"", believes the killing was gang-related. Anthony Anderson said he was like a father figure to the boy On Wednesday, just streets away from the scene of the fatal stabbing, a man had his face slashed in an attack. Police were called at 13:28 to reports of a man being chased by a group of youths on St Stephen's Close - about half a mile from the cordon. Officers found a man with a wound to his face in nearby Bromley Road and he was taken to hospital, police said. A Met spokesman said no one had been arrested and officers were trying to establish if this was the man who was being chased. Officers in plain clothes attended the scene of a second violent attack not far from the Bickley Road crime scene One resident claimed the area was linked to an ongoing postcode war Of the 132 murders in 2018, 77 were stabbings, compared to 80 the year before. In April,the Met set up a Â£15m violent crime taskforce, which in its first six months made 1,361 arrests, seized 340 knives, and recovered 258 offensive weapons. But has been the subject of criticism and described as""just a sticking plaster"". Met commissioner Cressida Dick told Radio 4's Today Programme on 27 December that knife crime in London had ""levelled off"", praising the ""Herculean effort"" of officers. London mayor Sadiq Khan, who said he was ""greatly saddened"" by the latest death, also set up the Violence Reduction Unit with Â£500,000 of funding in September to ""treat violence like a disease"". Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said she was ""devastated"" by the news from her constituency, describing it as a ""terrible, horrific event"". Waltham Forest Council leader, Clare Coghill, called for those with information to come forward, warning that ""to stay silent is to support murderers"". The Waltham Forest borough has had problems with gang crime and the local authority has spent Â£3 million on a four-year prevention programme. It commissioned a report,published last summer,,externalwhich found that so-called county lines drug gangs - which often target children and vulnerable youngsters - were operating in the area.

"A US teenager convicted of trying to kill her friend in order to please the fictional online character Slender Man has asked for her sentence to be reduced. Morgan Geyser is serving 40 years in a psychiatric hospital after the near fatal attack in Wisconsin in May 2014. Along with her classmate Anissa Weier, she lured Payton Leutner into woods and stabbed her 19 times. Payton managed to crawl free on to a path and survived. All three girls were 12 at the time. Geyser stood trial for attempted first-degree intentional homicide in adult court, where crimes that severe are usually heard. Her lawyers claim that because Geyser believed Slender Man would hurt her family if she didn't kill Payton, she should have instead stood trial for the second-degree version in youth court. As a juvenile, the 12-year-old would have been locked up for a maximum of three years if found guilty and then supervised until she was 18 but, as it was, the judge gave her the full sentence prosecutors asked for - arguing she was a risk to herself and others. The appeal also argues that when she agreed to be interviewed by detectives at the time, resulting in her confession, Morgan Geyser wouldn't have been able to understand what rights she had given up. Doctors gave conflicting opinions on the severity of her mental health and the treatment she needed. Slender Man isthought to have originatedfrom an internet competition in 2009, which asked for a modern myth that could terrify people. He's described in fictional stories as an unnaturally tall, thin, demon-like figure that lacks facial features, lives in a mansion in a forest and abducts children. Authorities say the girls had hoped to live in that fictional home after the attack. The film Slender Man was released in 2018 based on the story of the character.

"Senior Conservatives have signalled they are not prepared to support a no-deal Brexit as they inflicted a defeat on the government in Parliament. MPs backed an amendment to the Finance Bill, which would limit the scope for tax changes following a no deal unless authorised by MPs, by 303 to 296 votes. Twenty Tories rebelled and, while its practical effect will be limited, Labour said it was an ""important step"". But Brexiteers said the UK would leave the EU on 29 March, come what may. Before the vote, No 10 said a defeat would be ""inconvenient rather than significant"", with experts pointing out there were other mechanisms available to government to raise money. Former cabinet ministers Michael Fallon, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Ken Clarke and Sir Oliver Letwin were among the 20 Conservative MPs who defied the government by backing a cross-party amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter your postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP Live: MPs debate Finance Bill Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? Ministers speak out against no-deal Brexit Sir Oliver, a government loyalist who has never previously rebelled over Brexit, said he wanted to send a message to opponents of Theresa May's Brexit deal, to be voted on next week. ""I want to make it abundantly clear to my honourable friends who are voting against the prime minister's deal, which I shall be supporting, that the majority in this House will not allow a no-deal exit to occur on the 29 March. ""I will continue to do so right up to the end of March, in the hope that we can put pay to this disastrous proposal."" Mr Corbyn hailed the development as an ""important step"" towards preventing a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader tweeted:,external""It shows that there is no majority in Parliament, the cabinet or the country for crashing out of the EU without an agreement."" By Vicki Young, BBC chief political correspondent Downing Street was saying earlier that this would not be catastrophic if it was voted through, as it was a minor issue when it came to tax powers if there was a no-deal scenario. What this is about is Parliament saying to the government ""we can control this process"" if it comes to it. Opponents of a no-deal Brexit will say this shows they have the numbers to stop the government going down that path, although that will be argued against by the Brexiteers. It also shows the difficulty that Theresa May has when it comes to legislation because she does not have a working majority. Her arrangement with the DUP meant she was supposed to have a majority but if there are enough Conservative MPs willing to go against their own government, that disappears. The prime minister could try to turn this around and say to the Brexiteers ""you are jeopardising Brexit from happening at all"" because there is not a majority for a no-deal Brexit in the Commons. If you are trying to look for a bright side for the government, that is probably it. The setback, the government's sixth Commons defeat since July 2017, comes as MPs prepare to resume debate on Wednesday on the PM's proposed Brexit deal, culminating in a vote next week. It also comes at the end of a day in which senior ministers spoke out about the risks of exiting the EU without any agreement on the terms of withdrawal. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the cabinet that the public would take a ""dim view"" of government if it settled for a disorderly Brexit and suggested it would make the UK less safe. And Business Secretary Greg Clark said such an outcome ""could not be contemplated"". Yvette Cooper said the victory would send a strong message to government The Commons amendment is designed to make a no-deal exit harder by limiting the Treasury's ability to raise certain taxes after the UK left, without the explicit consent of Parliament. The technical changes to a crucial piece of government legislation were intended to demonstrate to ministers the strength of opposition to a no-deal Brexit in the Commons. Ms Cooper said although it would not block a no-deal exit, it ""set a precedent"" and showed MPs would not allow the UK ""to just drift into it by accident"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the vote was largely symbolic from an administrative point of view, as the powers being taken away from ministers were limited. But he said it sent a potent message that Tory MPs would ""revolt"" if the government changed its policy and embraced no deal as its desired outcome. Treasury minister Robert Jenrick said the government ""neither wanted nor expected"" a no-deal exit but defended ""prudent preparation to provide our taxpayers with the certainty they deserve"" and said all the defeat would do would be to make the UK ""somewhat less prepared"". Many Tory Brexiteers believe a no-deal exit, which would see the UK trade with the EU on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, is nothing to be feared. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said ""scare stories"" that it would lead to planes being grounded and ports being gridlocked must be put to bed. Tuesday's vote, he told Sky News, did not alter the fact that MPs had already passed legislation last year specifying that the UK would leave on 29 March. ""We have legislated to leave the EU, with or without a deal. That is what people voted for."" By the BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris There's a big problem facing members of Parliament who want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. They can't just show there is a majority in the House of Commons against no deal - they need to prove there is a majority in favour of an alternative outcome. That's because leaving the EU - with or without a deal - is currently the default. What we're likely to see over the next couple of months is what some are calling ""guerrilla warfare by amendment"" in the House of Commons. The trade bill is likely to be another target - it would be needed in the event of no deal, to try to keep the UK trading on the same terms as it has now with the rest of the world. The idea behind all this parliamentary manoeuvring is to demonstrate that there is a clear majority in the House of Commons against no deal. But none of it, taken in isolation, will prevent the Article 50 clock ticking away until it stops at the end of March.

"This video can not be played Ostend mayor Bart Tommelein says Ostend will not be ready by 29 March The mayor of Ostend has told the BBC the Belgian port will not be ready for a new ferry line in time for Brexit. Bart Tommelein was asked about the UK government's award of a Â£13.8m contract to Seaborne Freight for a service between Ramsgate and Ostend. He said it was ""impossible"" that Ostend would be ready and that he was going to Ramsgate next week to discuss the situation with ""all the stakeholders"". His remarks came as Transport Secretary Chris Grayling again defended the deal. Mr Grayling, appearing in the Commons to answer an urgent question tabled by Labour, said no money would be spent unless the service operated correctly. Mr Grayling said there were ""no reasons to believe any of those involved in this business are not fit to do business with government"". The controversy erupted after the BBC discovered that Seaborne had never run a ferry service before and did not have any ships. Later, it was discovered to have used terms and conditions on its website apparently intended for a takeaway food firm. Seaborne Freight 'will get no money upfront' Brexit ferry firm terms and conditions gaffe Local Conservative councillor Beverly Martin has already said Ramsgate harbour cannot be ready in time for the UK's scheduled departure from the EU on 29 March. Video has also emerged of Thanet District Council's deputy chief executive, Tim Willis, saying it is  ""rather late"" for the government to be spending for Brexit contingency, ""just a few short months away"". The Ostend mayor said he had doubts about Seaborne Freight and wanted bank guarantees to ensure that the city would not be left with the bill if the project ran into difficulty. Asked if Ostend would be ready to run regular services by 29 March, he told the BBC: ""No, that's impossible. We are interested in a ferry line... because we have a harbour and a harbour needs traffic. But there are some inconveniences, also some investments to do in our harbour [and] in the harbour of Ramsgate. ""We need some guarantees [from] the ferry line themselves because I'm worried about a few things... I want guarantees about the profitability of this ferry line and the solvency of this company."" Among his concerns were migrants using the port and the costs that Ostend could face for getting ready for the new ferry line. ""If the ferry line is getting millions of pounds [from] the government, I think they have to do some investments in the harbour,"" he said. UK to spend Â£103m on no-deal ferries Ramsgate 'can not be ready' for Brexit ferries Grayling defends no-deal Brexit ferry contract Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013. The contract to Seaborne was one of three awarded to ease potentially severe congestion at Dover in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Grayling told MPs that Seaborne would not get any money from the government if the service did not run and the contact award was ""done properly in a way that conforms with government rules"". When asked if the company had told the government which vessel would be used, he replied that the government had been told ""in great detail"" about the plans. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said Seaborne Freight had ""no money, no ships, no track record, no employees, no ports, one telephone line and no working website or sailing schedule"". One of the firm's directors, Ben Sharp, is already under investigation by a government department, he said. ""This is a shoddy and tawdry affair, and the secretary of state is making a complete mess of it,"" Mr McDonald said. He added that it ""violates every current best practice guidance issued by Whitehall"". It was very likely to be ""unlawful"". Mr Grayling said that Â£103m of contracts had been awarded to French company Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS, with the smaller contract awarded to Seaborne, a new British company. The government found ""nothing that would prevent them [Seaborne] from contracting with government"" after vetting of Seaborne Freight by lawyers Slaughter & May, accountants Deloitte and consultants Mott MacDonald.

"Energy supplier Economy Energy, which was recently banned from taking on new customers, has collapsed. The supply to its 235,000 domestic customers will continue, any credit they have will be protected, and a new supplier will take on their accounts. Regulator Ofgem said a new supplier would be appointed as soon as possible. On Friday, it had ordered the company to improve customer service. Economy Energy is the latest of a host of small suppliers to fold. Customers hadspoken of problemswith disputed account balances, the firm's failure to issue refunds, and concerns over billing delays. The Energy Ombudsman said it was looking into 1,303 complaints about the failed supplier. Economy Energy had posted a message on its website saying that after ""recent speculation and circulating misinformation"" it had ""no intention of closing our doors"". Energy price cap comes into force However, Ofgem stepped in on Friday, banning the company from taking on new customers for three months to ensure it improved its customer procedures. The regulator said Economy Energy had to address billing and payment failures, and issue customer refunds in a timely manner. Now, just a few days later, the business has ceased trading. Ofgem said that Economy Energy customers should not do anything at the moment, apart from taking a fresh meter reading. Prepayment meters can be topped up as normal. They will be told which supplier is taking on their gas and electricity service, and from that point they will be told about their new tariff and opportunities to switch. Some customers, who pay a set amount by direct debit each month, will have paid more than the energy they have used. This credit will be protected by the new supplier, so will not be affected. Behind the scenes, these costs are claimed by the new supplier from an industry levy. ""Ofgem will now choose a new supplier for you, ensure you get the best deal possible. While we are doing this our advice is to sit tight and don't switch. You can rely on your energy supply as normal. We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your new tariff,"" said Philippa Pickford, of Ofgem. ""We have seen a number of supplier failures over the last year and our safety net procedures are working as they should to protect customers."" In the past year, a number of small energy suppliers have gone bust, includingSpark Energy,Extra Energy,Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, One Select and Usio Energy. Gillian Guy, of Citizens Advice, said: ""The failure of energy suppliers is becoming an all too familiar story. Ofgem's moves to tighten up the licensing rules should address the problem of unprepared companies coming into the market. But the continued failure of suppliers shows there are firms operating that require the regulator's urgent attention."" Two Ofgem investigations into Economy Energy will now end, but a competition inquiry will continue. On its website, the company said: ""Economy Energy has ceased to trade. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is appointing a new supplier for its customers.""

"This video can not be played The day of the âharrowingâ disaster is remembered and wreaths are laid for those who died Survivors and relatives of some of the 47 people killed in one of the worst British air disasters have gathered for a service to remember the dead. A Boeing 737, carrying 126 people, crashed on to the M1 in Leicestershire on 8 January 1989. Witnesses described the ""devastation"" as the plane plunged into the embankment and smashed into pieces. Reverend Lauretta Wilson said the ""fateful night"" had never been forgotten in Kegworth. British Midland flight 92 had been diverted to East Midlands Airport after leaving Heathrow for Belfast when one of the plane's engines caught fire. The pilots then mistakenly switched off the wrong engine on the way to the airport. The pilots shut down the wrong engine and the plane crashed on the M1 in Leicestershire Witnesses said the plane ""bounced"" over the motorway, hit the central reservation and crashed into the embankment. About 150 people attended the service at St Andrew's Church in the village, where floral tributes were laid outside. Kegworth air disaster: The survivors' stories Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Opening the commemorations at the 30th anniversary service, Reverend Wilson said: ""Kegworth has never forgotten that fateful night on January 8 1989. ""Whatever our motivations, it is good to have the opportunity to remember and honour those who lost their lives. ""The dreadful event shook all of our communities."" Survivors and the families of those killed attended the service at St Andrew's Church Wreaths and flowers have also been placed at Kegworth Cemetery to remember those who died. Members of the emergency services, who were first at the scene when the aircraft crashed, also attended.

""We shouldn't have even been on that flight. We got to Heathrow early and I changed the flights from 21:20 to 19:20 BST,"" he said. Describing the crash, he added: ""We could see small bits of debris, sparks coming out of the left-hand engine. ""You could feel [the plane] wavering as the pilot struggled to keep it straight and then it thumped on the ground with an awful bang. ""When it came to a halt I suddenly realised 'I'm sitting here alive'â¦ There was a hole at the side of the plane which I started to clamber out through. ""This guy came walking up and just grabbed me and carried me down the banking."" This video can not be played News of the plane crash was broken on BBC Two by Michael Buerk Physiotherapist Helen Esplen, who was 25 in 1989, was travelling home on the M1 following a holiday when the plane crashed. She was one of the first people at the scene and managed to get to the cockpit where Captain Kevin Hunt and co-pilot David McClelland were trapped. Mrs Esplen helped to save the life of Mr McClelland, spending two hours keeping him conscious. She said: ""Every time he shut his eyes I kept talking to him; he would have known so much about my life. Later, he wrote a lovely letter thanking me."" Once the pilots were freed from the cockpit she was passed through the fuselage to help trapped passengers. She attended two teenage boys, one of whom died. The other she believes may have beenStephen McCoy. ""I was used to seeing trauma and blood, it was a matter of life and death, and hopefully I saved lives,"" she said. She received a Royal Humane Society award for her actions. Barry Bingham said he and his lifeboat colleagues climbed up the wreckage to help with the rescue A lifeboat crew, from Withernsea, Yorkshire, were travelling back from a training exercise when they saw the plane coming down. Barry Bingham, who with his colleagues helped with the rescue, said ""A lot of sparks came out from the engines and that was the point where one of them blew up. ""The wreckage was in three parts. There were flames coming up from the engine.""

"Amber Rudd raised concerns about a no-deal Brexit at the first cabinet meeting of the year Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, has said history will take ""a dim view"" of ministers if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. Ms Rudd told a cabinet meeting earlier that the UK would be less safe if there was a no-deal Brexit. Business Secretary Greg Clark has also told MPs a no-deal exit in March ""should not be contemplated"". MPs are set to vote soon on a measure which may restrict the government's tax powers in the event of a no-deal exit. Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? Bid to limit tax powers if no-deal Brexit The government has refused to rule out leaving the EU without an agreement and is continuing to make contingency plans. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons that ministers would be accused of ""irresponsibility"" if they weren't planning for all eventualities. In other Brexit developments: Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has cast doubt on claims UK and EU officials are talking about delaying Brexit if MPs reject Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. German and Irish foreign ministers meet to try to find a ""fix"" for the Irish border backstop A new government website advising consumers and businesses what to do in a no deal situation goes live on Tuesday, backed by a radio advertising campaign MPswrite to the head of the Met Policesaying they have ""serious concerns"" about public order and security outside Parliament, after Tory MP Anna Soubry was verbally abused outside Parliament by pro-Brexit supporters Mrs May appears to be facing a growing backlash against a possible no-deal Brexit - if her agreement is voted down next week. It is understood during Tuesday's Cabinet that Ms Rudd, a former home secretary who was a leading figure in the 2016 Remain campaign, told MPs history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country. ""We have to face the world as we find it, not as we wish it to be, and we have to deal with the facts as we find them,"" she is reported to have said. Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? Kuenssberg: What has changed? While she wanted Brexit to go ahead, she said it was important that Parliament tried to reach as much of a consensus as possible. ""More than ever we need to find the centre, reach across the House and find a majority for what will be agreed. Anything will need legislation."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said no deal would limit the government's ability to return illegal immigrants to other EU countries. And Environment Secretary Michael Gove said that those considering rejecting Mrs May's agreement in the hope of securing a better deal ""were like swingers in their mid-50s waiting for film star Scarlett Johansson to turn up on a date"". Mr Gove suggested those holding out for another deal would remain unsatisfied Ms Rudd added ""or Pierce Brosnan"", only for Justice Secretary David Gauke to quip that it was like ""waiting for Scarlett Johansson on a unicorn"". Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker, the ex-minister who was a key figure in the failed attempt to remove Theresa May as Conservative leader last month,tweeted,externalthat the swingers' allusion was ""not persuasive nor impressive"". On Monday, Business Minister Richard Harrington became the first minister to publicly say he would resign if the government pursued a no-deal exit and told the BBC others could follow suit. His boss, Business Secretary Greg Clark, told MPs on Tuesday a no-deal exit ""should not be contemplated"" because of the likely impact on business.. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs, headed by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Conservative Nicky Morgan, will later attempt to make it harder for the UK to leave the EU without a deal. The MPs have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill in the hope of stopping the government raising money to implement a no-deal Brexit, without the explicit consent of Parliament. The technical changes to a crucial piece of government legislation are intended to demonstrate to the government the strength of opposition to a no-deal Brexit in the Commons. Government sources warned over the weekend of ""paralysis"" and an effective ""shutdown"" if the Treasury was stripped of the power to pass regulations relating to ""no-deal financial provisions"" without parliamentary approval. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Labour have said they will back the amendment, prompting speculation that ministers will be forced to accept it in order to avoid a damaging defeat. If the government does not back down, a vote on the amendment is expected at about 19:00 GMT. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March whether there is a deal or not. The deal which Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with the EU - which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has not been formally approved. MPsare expected to vote on 15 Januaryfollowing five days of debate in the Commons. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said the UK remains committed to leaving on 29 March after theDaily Telegraph,externalsaid UK officials had been ""putting out feelers"" about extending Article 50, the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU. Mr Barclay said he had not spoken to the EU about that and any delay would cause ""some very practical issues"". His remarks came the day after Digital Minister Margot James suggesting Article 50 might have to be extended in order to stop a no-deal Brexit if Mrs May's deal is rejected by Parliament. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said extending Article 50 was the ""default"" back-up plan for the EU if MPs did not agree to the Brexit deal, although he was not aware of any officials who had discussed it at this stage. A no-deal Brexit would see the UK leave without a withdrawal agreement and start trading with the EU on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, an outcome favoured by some Brexiteers. David Davis, one of Mr Barclay's predecessors as Brexit secretary, told the BBC the fact that EU officials were talking about re-opening negotiations ""tells you that Mr Barclay's assertion that this is the only deal on the table is not, actually, entirely accurate"". ""Because what actually is going on, is the Europeans are thinking about the next stage, and the next stage is another round of negotiation,"" he told Radio 4's Today. He was speaking after Irish premier Leo Varadkar said the EU would offer the UK government fresh ""written"" assurances to help Mrs May get her deal through Parliament.

"This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry Speaker John Bercow has described the abuse and harassment of MPs outside Parliament as ""a type of fascism"" and called for a change of policing policy. He said recent incidents, includingTory MP Anna Soubry being verbally abusedon Monday, were ""intolerable"". At least 115 MPs have called on police to improve their response to abusive protesters outside Parliament. The Metropolitan Police has said it is ready to ""deal robustly"" with any instances of criminal harassment. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said the force was assessing whether any crimes had been committed, following a third-party report of a public order offence on College Green, opposite the Houses of Parliament. He said Scotland Yard will be ""enhancing the policing presence"" in the run-up to next week's vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal. Revised advice was issued to MPs by Parliament security on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a man has been arrested on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to get into Parliament. Armed officers arrested him at about 19:20 GMT on Tuesday after he got through Carriage Gates, at the entrance to the Houses of Parliament. He was taken to a police station, the Metropolitan Police said. The incident is not being treated as terror-related. Why do broadcasters use College Green? May: 'Be careful about language' on Brexit 'I'm frightened for my safety' - MP The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times."" Ms Soubry was shouted at - including being called a liar and a Nazi - during live TV interviews on BBC News and Sky. The former minister - a supporter of a fresh Brexit referendum - was later called ""scum"" and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. She criticised police for not intervening and called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""The real concern is the threat to democracy"" Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act means that ""threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour"" might be deemed a criminal offence. But Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) and Article 11 (right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association) of the European Convention on Human Rights contain the rights to peaceful protest. College Green is regularly used by media to interview politicians, as well as being a popular site for protesters to gather. Social media abuse of politicians' staff Abusive tweets to MPs 'more than double' Ms Soubry told the BBC she had ""no problem with people protesting"", saying this was a ""very small group of far-right extremists who just want to undermine democracy"". The MP for Broxtowe said: ""There is a very clear distinction between peaceful, lawful protest and robust debate - holding MPs to account, and it can be face to face - and some of the scenes we have seen in the last six weeks here at Parliament."" The cross-party group of MPs who have signed the letter - which includes those both for and against Brexit - said many of the concerns had been ""repeatedly raised"" with officers and senior policing staff. ""We write to express our serious concerns about the deteriorating public order and security situation in and around the exterior of the Parliamentary estate including College Green,"" the letter, co-ordinated by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, read. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""This situation cannot stand"" ""After months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far-right and extreme right connections - which your officers are well aware of - have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public."" The letter said there appeared to be a ""lack of co-ordination in the response from the police and appropriate authorities"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" Sky News presenter Kay Burley said the ""increasingly vile, aggressive and intimidating"" abuse had forced her to change her own route to Parliament and she now had to have security protection. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she had been interviewed three times by the police about the situation, but the protesters knew their rights and what they could and couldn't get away with. But she added: ""How far does it have to escalate before the police have to take it seriously?"" Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She pointed to the murder of MP Jo Cox,who was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency by right-wing extremist Thomas Mair in June 2016. Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was ""concerned"" about a ""pattern of protest"" targeting female MPs and journalists and called it a ""type of fascism"". In his letter to the Met Police chief on Tuesday, he said he recognised it was ""a difficult job striking the balance between allowing peaceful protests and intervening when things turn sour"". But he added: ""It's one thing demonstrating from a distance with placards, or calling out slogans - and another, where the protester invades the personal space of a member, subjects him or her to a tirade of menacing, racist, sexist and misogynistic abuse, and follows them back to their place of work."" Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick took up the job in 2017 Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has previously spoken out against online abuse, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that some protesters were ""organised right-wing groups"" trying to ""scare our politicians into making decisions based on fringe views"". ""People deserve to be safe at work,"" the Birmingham Yardley MP said. ""I didn't come here to be bullied by far-right bullies, far-left bullies, or anyone, we came here to do what we felt was best."" Also on Monday, political commentator Owen Jones published a video on Twitter that he had recorded while being followed and shouted at by a group of protesters outside Parliament. Last month, a video emerged of prominent Brexiteer Michael Gove being accosted by a protester dressed as Santa as he walked to Parliament. Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. Jump in far-right extremism referrals Far-right 'moving increasingly online' By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online far-right campaigner James Goddard. He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles. He told police outside Parliament they were ""fair game"" and ""if you want a war, we will give you a war"". Mr Goddard emerged as a DIY far-right campaigner last year as he began to gather followers after campaigning in support of the then-jailed anti-Islam activist, Stephen Lennon aka Tommy Robinson. Before the incident at Parliament involving Ms Soubry, he'd been helping to organise France-style ""yellow vest"" protests - including attempts to block bridges in London. Mr Goddard relies on donations from his followers - he frequently runs crowdfunding appeals for his campaigns. On Tuesday evening, Facebook confirmed it has closed his account. ""We will not tolerate hate speech on Facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke real-world violence,"" said a spokesman. Minutes later, his separate Paypal crowdfunding page disappeared too. No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". The BBC and other broadcasters have set up temporary studios on College Green ahead of the Commons vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal on 15 January. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said some MPs had expressed unease privately about being interviewed there, given the frequency and vehemence of the protests.

"MPs say they now fear for their safety when they go to be interviewed by the media on a green opposite the Houses of Parliament. What is going on? For decades now, College Green has been used as a venue for broadcast interviews. For MPs, it has the advantage of being convenient - they simply have to stroll across the road from the House of Commons to be guaranteed a bigger audience for their views than they would ever get from speaking in the chamber. For broadcasters, College Green provides the all-important sense of being at the heart the action, and gives them access to a steady stream of willing interviewees. Anti-Brexit demonstrator Steve Bray talks to officers on College Green It has traditionally been seen as a haven for backbenchers eager to get on the airwaves. Broadcast insiders call it the ""honeypot"" - MPs booked to do an interview by one outlet are collared by producers from rival outlets as soon as they come off air and ushered towards another microphone. Some MPs and ministers prefer to be interviewed in the more controlled, and less muddy, environment of the TV studio. Police under pressure over MP harassment Most broadcasters, including the BBC, have studios at Westminster, not far from College Green - where they can be interviewed ""down the line"" by presenters in another location. College Green has traditionally tended to be pressed into action on big Parliamentary occasions such as budgets or general elections. On really big occasions, the main evening news bulletins will be presented from an elevated platform on College Green, offering a commanding view of the Palace of Westminster all lit up at night for added drama. News presenters don't always have parliamentary passes, so hosting bulletins or news channel segments from within the building itself is not possible. But the extra space and freedom of the open-air studio makes the green a more desirable location anyway. Pro-Brexit demonstrators are also making their voice heard TV cameras were not allowed in the Commons chamber until 1989 - and broadcasters were allowed to film interviews with MPs in the building in only 2000, initially from a glass booth in the central lobby. Strict rules remain about where cameras can be placed. Filming on the green gives broadcasters more control, as well as allowing guests without parliamentary passes to take part in live debates. One thing the broadcasters can't control, of course, is what goes on in the back of their shots. Interruptions by placard-waving protesters are an occupational hazard for anyone filming outside Parliament. People have every right to stage protests - the roads and greens around Parliament are public rights of way - and, in normal times, there is little real friction. Brexit has changed that dynamic, however. The media has set up what is starting to feel like a permanent tented village, as the story continues to dominate the news bulletins. They might not broadcast from there every day but it has become a focal point for demonstrators. The site is now ringed by metal barriers and the police have increased their presence. The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times."" The Parliamentary authorities have issued revised safety advice to MPs planning to take part in media interviews on the green. This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry Most demonstrators - including the small group of anti-Brexit campaigners who set up their banners and flags outside Parliament every day and the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave group who join them on occasions - are peaceful, although they have had occasional run-ins with the police and each other. The most dogged of the anti-Brexit protesters, Steve Bray, engages in a daily game of cat and mouse with the broadcasters as he tries to get his slogan in shot. In recent weeks, however, a more aggressive brand of demonstrators, from the pro-Brexit side, have started showing up to harangue and intimidate certain MPs as they make the short journey from the Commons to the green and back again. Commons Speaker John Bercow has described them, in a letter to the Metropolitan Police, as a ""regular coterie of burly white men who are effectively targeting and denouncing members whom they recognise and dislike - most notably female and those from ethnic minority backgrounds"". Journalists, such as the Guardian's Owen Jones, have also been targeted. Sky News's Kay Burley says she has been interviewed three times by police investigating alleged incidents of abuse amid ""the chaos that is College Green at the moment"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live she supported the right of people to protest but ""it has become increasingly vile and aggressive and, yes, intimidating as well"", specifically targeting anti-Brexit Conservative MP Anna Soubry, when she was on air. More than 100 MPs have now called on the Metropolitan Police to do more to protect MPs - the police say they are ready to ""deal robustly"" with any instances of criminal harassment but they have to ""strike a balance"" that allows for protesters to exercise their democratic rights. A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online far-right campaigner James Goddard. He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles.

"This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry MP Anna Soubry has criticised police for not intervening after she was verbally abused outside Parliament. The Conservative ex-minister was accused ""of being a Nazi"", while being interviewed on the BBC News channel. She called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. The police said they were assessing if any crimes had been committed while Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was worried about a ""pattern"" of women MPs and journalists being targeted. Raising the issue in the House of Commons, Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She accused far-right groups of re-playing Monday's clip and others like it on social media sites to ""raise revenue for their trolling activities"". Ms Soubry, the pro-European MP for Broxtowe who supports another Brexit referendum, was subjected to verbal abuse while being interviewed by the BBC's Simon McCoy. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Protesters standing just a few yards from the entrance to Parliament accused her of being a liar and then chanted: ""Anna Soubry is a Nazi."" She was later shouted at and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. Reacting during the live interview, she told McCoy she ""objected to being called a Nazi"", adding that such language was ""astonishing  - and this is what has happened to our country"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" She said she would not be silenced nor intimidated but it was wrong that MPs and others doing their job in such a public space should ""have to accept this as part of the democratic process"". After the incident, she told BBC News the police needed to ""do their job"" and would contact them about the matter. The Metropolitan Police said they were investigating reports of a public order offence but no arrests had been made. The MP has already been in touch with the parliamentary authorities responsible for security. A number of MPs raised the matter with Mr Bercow at the end of a statement on the government's Brexit policy. Labour's Stephen Doughty called for ""proper action"" to be taken by the Metropolitan Police against those responsible for what he said were ""potentially unlawful actions"". And Conservative MP Nick Boles urged Mr Bercow to ensure everything possible was done to not only protect the right to freedom of speech but the right of MPs to move freely in and around Parliament in ""total safety"". Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. While the Met had responsibility for security outside the parliamentary estate, he said, he was keeping a ""close eye"" on the issue amid concerns that women, in particular, were being targeted. ""I share 100% the concerns expressed and it's necessary to state very publicly the difference between peaceful protest on one hand and the aggressive, intimidatory and threatening protest on the other."" Ms Creagh said there was a ""strong streak of misogyny"" in the wave of Brexit-related abuse directed against MPs. ""We in this place remember our friend Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right neo-Nazi,"" she said. ""We remember that people have gone to prison for plotting to murder another Labour MP and many people have been jailed for the abuse of other colleagues."" No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". A Downing Street spokesman said there were laws dealing with public order offences and cases of harassment and threatening behaviour.

The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said some MPs had expressed unease privately about being interviewed there given the frequency and vehemence of the protests.

"A woman has suffered chemical injuries after she was mistakenly prescribed erectile dysfunction cream for a dry eye condition. The woman, from Glasgow, had to be treated at A&E after she was given Vitaros cream instead of the eye lubricant VitA-POS. Her experienceis detailed in December's BMJ Case Reports journal.,external The report calls for doctors to use block capitals in handwritten prescriptions to avoid errors. The woman was given a handwritten prescription for VitA-POS, a liquid paraffin lubrication, for treatment of severe dry eyes and corneal erosions. The mix-up happened between her GP and pharmacist, where she was issued with Vitaros, an erectile dysfunction cream. After using it she suffered eye pain, blurred vision, redness and swollen eyelid. The mild chemical injury to her eye was treated in hospital with topical antibiotics, steroids and lubricants, which cleared it up in a few days. Dr Magdalena Edington, from Glasgow's Tennent Institute of Ophthalmology, wrote the report for the December edition of BMJ Case Reports.

"Morrisons reported a rise in sales in the Christmas shopping period, while the market share of discounters Aldi and Lidl reached its highest-ever level for the festive season. David Potts, chief executive of the number four supermarket chain, said customers were ""increasingly savvy"". While the business was getting ready for Brexit, he said two-thirds of the produce it sold was from the UK. Morrisons' sales rose 3.6% in the nine weeks to 6 January. This increase in like-for-like sales, which strips out new store openings, was driven by a 3% rise in the wholesale division, which supplies Amazon and McColls. In the stores, sales rose 0.6% - more than the 0.5% expected by analysts - but there was a slowdown from the 1.3% in the third quarter andthe 2.1% reported last Christmas. Supermarkets battle over New Year price cuts Is it the end of the supermarket checkout till? Its shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down nearly 4%. Even as the company maintained its outlook for the 2018-19 financial year, Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said Morrisons remained under pressure from rivals in the so-called 'big four' and the discounters. ""A resurgent Tesco, the proposed Asda/Sainsbury alliance and the continuing advance of Aldi and Lidl all add to a challenging environment,"" Mr Hunter said. Morrisons said it had ""performed well, sustaining a strong offer and trading the business hard"" for customers. Mr Potts said that consumer behaviour had changed as he hailed the retailer's fourth consecutive Christmas of like-for-like sales growth. ""People became increasingly savvy and conscious of both the macro political situation in the country and how that may unfold in 2019 and how it may affect them personally,"" he said. While customer spending increased during the summer, while England were progressing through the World Cup, customers later became more cautious, he said. That has continued in the first few trading days of this year, when customers have continued to be cost-conscious, he said. On Monday, Morrisons said it would cut prices by an average of 20% on 935 products, including tinned tomatoes, cereals and multivitamins. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said 60% of supermarket customers this Christmas had been ""looking to make their money go further over the holidays"". According to Kantar's data for the 12 weeks to 30 December, discounters Aldi and Lidl had a combined market share of 12.7% over the festive period, their highest-ever for Christmas. Two-thirds of all households shopped at either Aldi or Lidl over the 12-week period, Kantar said. By its reckoning, Asda was top of the ""big four"" grocers, with a 0.7% rise in sales, and Sainsbury's the weakest, with a 0.4% decline. Morrisons is traditionally a lower-cost supermarket and in its trading update said it had kept prices of key Christmas items the same as last year. Customers' satisfaction - on measures such as ""colleague friendliness and checkout experience"" -  had ""increased significantly"", which it said was an important measure of its progress in turning around the business. Like-for-like sales across the group, including fuel, were up 3.4%. Total sales were up 4% excluding fuel. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director of Fidelity Personal Investing, said that ""tucked away in the Christmas trading update was what really attracted shoppers - not cheery staff and faster checkouts, but last year's prices"". Preparations for Brexit were continuing, Mr Potts said, but the retailer was not making assumptions about the eventual outcome. He said two-thirds of what it sold was made in Britain, where it also had 18 manufacturing sites. There would be slightly less reliance on EU labour, he said.

"Bryan Cranston appears alongside Kevin Hart in The Upside Bryan Cranston has defended playing a disabled character in his latest film, saying his casting as a man with quadriplegia was ""a business decision."" In The Upside, the US actor plays a wheelchair-using billionaire who hires a former criminal, played by comedian Kevin Hart, to be his live-in carer. ""As actors we're asked to play other people,"" said the Breaking Bad star. Cranston said the subject was ""worthy for debate"" and there should be ""more opportunities"" for disabled actors. Yet he maintained he was entitled to play characters whose attributes and abilities differed from his own. ""If I, as a straight, older person, and I'm wealthy, I'm very fortunate, does that mean I can't play a person who is not wealthy, does that mean I can't play a homosexual?"" he mused. ""I don't know, where does the restriction apply, where is the line for that?"" he told the Press Association. Jake Gyllenhaal and Dwayne Johnson are among others who have faced criticism for playing disabled characters. Gyllenhaal's 2017 film Stronger, about a man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon bombings, was criticised for not casting a disabled actor in the role. Last year, meanwhile, Johnson was censured for calling for more disabled actors on screen while also playing a man with a prosthetic leg in action film Skyscraper. Jake Gyllenhaal film slated over casting Is Dwayne Johnson's disabled role 'offensive'? Cranston's comments come in the wake of ongoing debate over whether it is appropriate for straight actors to play gay or transgender roles or for white actors to play characters associated with ethnic minorities. Scarlett Johansson,Tilda Swinton,external,Jack WhitehallandEd Skreinare among those who have faced criticism for accepting certain roles. Some have gone on to withdraw from projects following a backlash. Last month Darren Criss said he wouldno longer accept LGBT scriptsbecause he did not want to be ""another straight boy taking a gay man's role"". The Glee actor played a gay serial killer in American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace - a performance that won him an Emmy in December and a Golden Globe on Sunday. Nicole Kidman (left) also appears in the US remake of French film Intouchables Scarlett Johansson drops out of trans role Actor quits film over 'whitewashing' Hart, meanwhile, believes there are always positives to discussions about diversity and inclusion. ""I think having a conversation started is always a good thing,"" he said. ""In this particular case, bringing awareness to the fact that hey, we would love to see more disabled people given the opportunities to participate in the entertainment world, and potentially grow."" The comedian turned actor faced renewed criticism himself recently for comments he made in 2010 about his fears that his son might grow up gay. Criticism of his remarks led to himstepping down as hostof next month's Oscars ceremony and apologising to the LGBTQ community for his ""insensitive words"". Hart apologised again this week on his SiriusXM radio show, saying he was ""now aware"" of how his words had make members of the LGBTQ community feel. ""I think that in the times that we're living in, we have to be understanding and accepting of people and change,""he told his listeners,external. Hart (right) plays a reformed criminal who becomes Cranston's live-in carer Britain's Ben Whishaw expressed similar sentiments to Cranston's on Sunday after winning a Golden Globe for playing a gay man in A Very English Scandal.

"An expert has warned that errors made when signing up to online services could mean people are ""handing over the keys to their digital life"". Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, said valuable data was being put at risk by people inputting the wrong email address. Such an error allowed BBC News to see details of a stranger's credit report. The personal details, listed on credit scoring site ClearScore, were accessed by someone of the same name. In this case, it appears that somebody applied to sign up to the credit service, but entered a slightly incorrect email address, which doubles as the account's username. An email was then sent to the actual owner of that email address, who had the same name. That person was then able to change the password, access the account and see a range of personal details. This included date of birth, previous addresses and - most significantly - historical information of a host of previous applications for credit, such as loans and betting. Want to shop online? Best have a mobile signal Dating site scam victims lose Â£2,000 to fraudsters Can companies ever keep our data safe? Such information would be extremely valuable to a fraudster, who could use it to apply for loans and other financial services in the stranger's name. After being alerted to the case, a ClearScore spokesman said: ""When something like this happens, ClearScore makes the worst-case assumption that it is fraud and locks everything down."" The website carries a reminder at the sign-up stage urging the applicant to ensure the correct email address is used. There is also information on the site about staying safe from fraud. Prof Woodward said that a great deal of attention was paid to choosing secure passwords for web-based services and regularly changing them. However, he said that email addresses were an important gateway to people's digital information and should always be entered with care. ""An email address is the key to your digital life,"" he said, pointing out that dots and underscores could easily be missed when entering an email address in a hurry. He said that online services should use two-factor authentication - such as a code to a mobile phone - and ensure that applicants entered their email correctly twice to cut out mistakes. Banks are also being urged to findother ways to check a customer's identity. It is impossible to tell how often errors lead to details being revealed, but the similarities between email addresses - which may only differ with a dot or a dash - make mistakes a regular occurrence.

"Mr Magnitz had just left a new year event in Bremen when he was attacked German far-right politician Frank Magnitz has been beaten up and severely injured in an attack seen by police as politically motivated. The leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Bremen was attacked by at least three masked men in the centre of the northern city on Monday. The attackers knocked him unconscious with a piece of wood and kicked him in the head, AfD officials said. The government and politicians across the spectrum condemned the attack. Mr Magnitz, 66, had just left a new year reception in Bremen's Kunsthalle art museum when he was attacked in the city's Goetheplatz as he walked to a central car park. Police said he was beaten over the head with an unknown object by three men who then fled. Two local tradesman came to his aid and he was taken to hospital. Outcry at far-right child informer scheme Just how far to the right is AfD? German far right in vigilante threat Speaking from hospital on Tuesday, Mr Magnitz said he had little memory of what happened. Joint party leader Alice Weidel described the incident as an ""assassination attempt"" while local officials in Bremen blamed ""incitement"" from the centre-left SPD and Green parties. This edited picture shows Frank Magnitz in hospital after what Mr Meuthen called ""a cowardly and sickening attack"" Another party spokesman, JÃ¶rg Meuthen, tweeted a photo of Mr Magnitz lying unconscious in his hospital bed and said he had been left ""half-dead"". He had a big gash on his forehead and severe bruising around his right eye. AfD entered the national parliament (Bundestag) for the first time last year with 94 seats and now has representatives in every German state parliament. Its anti-immigration platform has struck a chord, particularly in eastern Germany where it hopes to make gains in three state elections this year. AfD is also eyeing the May 2019 European Parliament elections. Last week an AfD office in the eastern town of DÃ¶beln was damaged by an explosion. No-one was hurt. SPD leader Andrea Nahles said that AfD was a ""political opponent"" of Germany's tolerant society but anyone trying to fight it with violence ""betrays these values and jeopardises our co-existence"".

"The poet said the Borders landscape sneaked into his work on a regular basis A writer based in the Scottish Borders has won the prestigious Costa Book prize for poetry. JO Morgan, originally from Edinburgh, took the award for his work Assurances about the nuclear tensions of the Cold War period. He said that although the work was not based in the Borders, the local landscape had influenced it. The judges said they were ""dazzled"" by the ""originality and inventiveness"" of the poem. The poet - from Stow - said he was surprised to have won and was still coming to terms with taking the award. ""I think I can get round it in my head if I remind myself that it is the book that has won, not me,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Scotland. ""I get some benefit from it, obviously, but really it is great for the book to hopefully get more readers to it."" Assurances looks at the early years of the Cold War Although previous works had been more clearly influenced by the backdrop of southern Scotland, he said the area was still a part of this poem. ""This one doesn't really focus on the Borders so much - it really takes us back to the late 1950s and early years of the Cold War,"" he said. ""There are a variety of voices that do come into it and overheard voices. ""But there is also the aspect of landscape and, of course, I do live in the Borders and I live in a rural part and I am often looking down the valley. ""It is very difficult to sort of avoid that landscape creeping into my work at any available opportunity and it certainly does here, keen-eyed readers will probably find."" The work was also influenced by his own family background. ""My father was in the RAF himself and he was actually part of the division dealing with the nuclear deterrent around that time so it was a subject that I just happened to know about,"" he said. ""In recent years I thought: 'I might try that, I might see what I can make of that'."" ""It is an intriguing subject,"" he added. ""It is still a relevant subject."" Mr Morgan takes Â£5,000 for winning the poetry section and is one of five winning writers now in contention for the overall book of the year award to be announced at the end of the month.

"User @_0rbit tweeted new information every day in December A 20-year-old man has made a ""comprehensive"" confession that he was behind a data breach affecting hundreds of high-profile Germans, police say. Styling himself ""G0d"", he published private information about politicians, journalists, and celebrities on Twitter, under the username @_0rbit. Investigators said the man was still in education and living with his parents. The suspect said he acted alone and out of annoyance at statements made by the public figures he attacked. About 1,000 people were affected, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Politicians from every major political party except for the far-right AfD were targeted, although investigators said they had yet to find evidence of the suspect's political inclinations. Germany's federal criminal police (BKA) said the information published online included telephone numbers, addresses, credit card data, photographs, and private communications. Investigators said the German citizen they arrested had co-operated and led them to evidence they may not have found without help. Police are also still investigating seized computer hardware. In a statement, the BKA said he was detained after a search of his home in the state of Hesse on Sunday. He is accused of spying and the unauthorised publication of data. His provisional arrest, however, was lifted on Monday evening. He was released ""due to a lack of grounds for detention"", police said. They took into account both his age and his co-operation. The @_0rbit Twitter account has been suspended since coming to widespread attention late last week. Before then, it published the leaked information in an ""advent calendar event"" each day in December. Its biography had described itself as involved in ""security research"". Of the almost 1,000 politicians, celebrities and journalists affected by the leak, some 50 attacks were ""more serious"", involving private correspondence or photos, officials said. Angela Merkel, Greens leader Robert Habeck and TV satirist Jan BÃ¶hmermann have all been targeted by the attack Among those affected were: Chancellor Angela Merkel: her email address and several letters to and from the chancellor appear to have been published The main parliamentary groups including the ruling centre-right and centre-left parties, as well asThe Greens, left-wingDie LinkeandFDP. Only AfD appears to have escaped Greens leader Robert Habeck, who had private chats with family members and credit card details posted online Journalists from public broadcastersARDandZDFas well as TV satiristJan BÃ¶hmermann, rapperMarteriaand rap groupK.I.Z,reports say Another TV satirist,Christian Ehring,is said to have had 3.4 gigabytes of data stolen and posted online, including holiday photos. Last year he won a court case brought by AfD leader Alice Weidel, who complained when he called her a ""slut"" on his TV show. Centre-left SPD MP Florian Postsaid he felt ""quite shocked"" by the leak of account statements and other details online, but he added that at least one file that had been posted was fake. The fallout has created widespread alarm politically. Robert Habeck, leader of the Greens, deleted both his Twitter and Facebook accounts on Monday after being affected by the data breach. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, said he would introduce new data protection legislation in the next six months. The suspect has told police he acted alone. Investigators, quoted by DPA, said the 20-year-old had taught himself the skills he needed using online resources, and had no training in computer science. The private information seems to have been acquired over a substantial period of time in 2018 in what officials called a ""sophisticated"" operation, and added to publicly available information. He ""exploited several vulnerabilities"", investigators said, adding that several such security gaps have since been fixed. BKA chief Holger Munch told a news conference that the suspect ""gained access to various accounts, obviously using hacking methods"" - but that access to those accounts had now been taken away. It has also emerged that German officials knew of at least one attack last year, but thought it was an isolated case. The German Federal office for Information Security revealed it learned of one breach in early December On Saturday the BSI information security agency said that a member of the German parliament had reported suspicious activity on their email account in early December. In a statement, the agency said it was linked to the @_0rbit leaks only when the account's existence became known last week. German officials also said there was no evidence to suggest that government systems had been compromised. Nonetheless, the scandal has prompted calls for action to improve cyber-security practices.

Mr Carson, 75, of St Bartholomew's Court, Riverside, Cambridge,was accused of the sexual abuseof boys under 16, from 1978 to 2009. His Mazda left the road and hit a tree at 09:45 GMT on Monday, police have said. He died at the scene. Peterborough Crown Court was informed of his death on Tuesday morning.

"US President Donald Trump is set to argue that an immigration ""crisis"" requires his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. Mr Trump will make his case in his first speech from the Oval Office at 21:00EST (0200 GMT Wednesday), ahead of a trip to the border on Thursday. A partial government shutdown has been in effect for 17 days after lawmakers failed to break a budget impasse. The president is insisting that $5bn (Â£4bn) be included for the border wall. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? The impact of the government shutdown Shutdown 'embarrassing' to US tech industry White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a tweet that Mr Trump would use his visit to the border on Thursday to ""meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis"". Ahead of the speech on Tuesday, Vice-President Mike Pence said Mr Trump's decision to address the nation ""comes from this president's deep desire to do his job to protect the American people"". Donald Trump says there is a growing crisis along the US-Mexico border that demands immediate and drastic action. The challenge for Mr Trump is that he has been calling for a wall - a bigger, longer one - since he announced his presidential bid in 2015. That has made it hard for his opponents to believe there is a new situation that requires the same solution, except smaller and shorter. What's more, administration officials have been vague - perhaps intentionally - on the numbers supporting their claims. They say 4,000 ""terrorists"" have been caught entering the US, but it turns out most stops happen at airports. There have been only a handful apprehended at the Mexican border (fewer than at the border with Canada). The White House has recently painted this as a humanitarian problem - and Central American families are, in fact, fleeing poverty and violence. But can he make the case that a wall is the humanitarian answer, and not just a way of making refugee suffering less visible to Americans? The president must convince a sceptical public that his wall is worth the pain the shutdown is causing government workers and the nation at large. He has eight minutes on Tuesday to do it. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall The decision by the major US TV networks to set aside at least eight minutes of airtime for the speech has sparked controversy and fuelled debate on social media. Critics pointed out that the networks aired President George W Bush's prime-time address on immigration in 2006, but did not air one by President Barack Obama in 2014. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on Tuesday that they would deliver a joint rebuttal from the halls of Congress after Mr Trump has spoken. Some reporters have called on the White House to provide the text of his remarks in advance to be fact-checked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, living former US presidents disputed Mr Trump's claim that some of them had privately told him they regretted not building a border wall during their administrations. ""I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue,"" former President Jimmy Carter said in a statement issued by the Carter Center on Monday. A spokesman for George W Bush said he had never discussed the border wall with Mr Trump. A representative for Bill Clinton denied it and said that the two men had not spoken since Mr Trump took office, according to CBS. Mr Obama has not explicitly denied Mr Trump's claim, but has extensively campaigned against the president on the issue. In Mr Pence's interview with NBC on Tuesday,external, he sought to clarify the president's original claim, saying ""that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents"". ""I know I've seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security, the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration,"" he added. Mr Trump will visit the US-Mexico border on Thursday The White House has been under fire amid a partial government shutdown, which began on 22 December and affects a quarter of the government. Some 800,000 federal employees have been temporarily laid off - or are working without pay. Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior and the Treasury. US media are reporting that Mr Trump will not declare a national emergency on Tuesday evening, in a bid to launch construction of a wall by circumventing Congress. US law allows the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from defence department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes,the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says. Such a move would prompt members of Congress who are tasked with allocating tax money - including some Republicans - to push back, he says. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president in 2016. During the campaign for the mid-term elections in November 2018, he repeatedly warned of a ""caravan"" of Central American migrants making its way towards the US-Mexico border. In a reaction that many saw as a political ploy during a campaign season, he deployed 5,800 US troops to the border due to what he described as an ""invasion"". Last month, Mr Trump suggested that the US military could be used to build the wall. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A woman has suffered chemical injuries after she was mistakenly prescribed erectile dysfunction cream for a dry eye condition. The woman, from Glasgow, had to be treated at A&E after she was given Vitaros cream instead of the eye lubricant VitA-POS. Her experienceis detailed in December's BMJ Case Reports journal.,external The report calls for doctors to use block capitals in handwritten prescriptions to avoid errors. The woman was given a handwritten prescription for VitA-POS, a liquid paraffin lubrication, for treatment of severe dry eyes and corneal erosions. The mix-up happened between her GP and pharmacist, where she was issued with Vitaros, an erectile dysfunction cream. After using it she suffered eye pain, blurred vision, redness and swollen eyelid. The mild chemical injury to her eye was treated in hospital with topical antibiotics, steroids and lubricants, which cleared it up in a few days. Dr Magdalena Edington, from Glasgow's Tennent Institute of Ophthalmology, wrote the report for the December edition of BMJ Case Reports. In it, she said: ""Prescribing errors are common, and medications with similar names and packaging increase risk. ""However, it is unusual in this case that no individual, including the patient, general practitioner or dispensing pharmacist, questioned erectile dysfunction cream being prescribed to a female patient, with ocular application instructions. ""We believe this to be an important issue to report, to enhance awareness and promote safe prescribing skills."" Although many prescriptions are digitised rather than handwritten, she wants to raise awareness that medications with similar spellings exist and encourage prescribers ""to ensure that handwritten prescriptions are printed in block capital letters (including the hyphen with VitA-POS) to avoid similar scenarios in the future"". Data released last yearsuggested GPs, pharmacists, hospitals and care homes may be making 237 million prescription errors a year - the equivalent of one mistake for every five drugs issued. The errors include wrong medications being given, incorrect doses dispensed and delays in medication being administered. The study said most caused no problems, but in more than a quarter of cases the mistakes could have caused harm. Robbie Turner, director of pharmacy at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said the organisation was ""sorry"" to hear about what happened to this patient. ""Mistakes are taken very seriously by pharmacists, who work hard to ensure patient safety, knowing the harm they can cause. ""Most prescriptions these days are electronic, removing errors due to handwriting. Whatever the particular reasons for this error, collaboration between pharmacists and prescribers makes care safer and helps reduce mistakes."" Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""Most GPs now use digital systems to ensure the right medication is being prescribed to the right person, with several online prompts to make sure they are satisfied with the choice of drug, dosage, and length of prescription. ""These systems have substantially reduced the likelihood of prescribing errors - but it is still important to maintain open and rapid channels of communication between GPs and pharmacists, so that if there are any queries regarding a patient's medication they can be answered.""

"Amazon's Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man Amazon, formed 25 years ago, has eclipsed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable listed company. The online giant was worth $797bn (Â£634bn) when the US stock market closed on Monday after rising 3.4% and moved past Microsoft, valued at $789bn. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the world's wealthiest man, with riches of $135bn, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index. Heovertook Microsoft founder Bill Gates last year. It is the first time Amazon has held the top position. The share prices of US tech giants have been on a rollercoaster in recent months on worries about sales and trade tensions. Founded by Mr Bezos in 1994, Amazon started life as a niche second-hand book seller and has become an online retailer of items ranging from fresh food to clothes. The firm was created in a garage in a suburb of Seattle, Washington. It was originally called ""Cadabra,"" (as in ""abracadabra"") and in 1995 sold its first book - Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought, by Douglas Hofstadter. By early 1996, Amazon was selling books online throughout the US. The business was floated on the stock exchange in 1997, raising $54m. As a result, Mr Bezos joined the ranks of the world's richest business people before he turned 35 years of age. For more than a decade, the company put growth ahead of profit, investing in warehouses, distribution networks and data systems. In 2017, it paid $13.7bn for Whole Foods Market, which brought it a large network of physical stores for the first time. It has also emerged as a major creator of original entertainment content, producing original drama series. In addition, it has won the rights to broadcast live sporting action, such as football from England's Premier League and ATP tennis. The firm has developed a raft of other products and services, including the Kindle e-reader and Alexa virtual assistant, among others. How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Major technology stocks have been volatile in recent months. In August, Apple became the world's first public company to be worth $1tn (Â£767bn), while Amazon achieved that valuation in September. Since then, Apple's fortunes on the stock market have waned after it warned about a slowdown in China. The tech giant is now valued at $702bn. Amazon's market value tops $1tn Jeff Bezos's wealth tops $150bn New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Mr Kim is visiting China with his wife Ri Sol-ju, state media report North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has arrived in Beijing for an unannounced visit, at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr Kim will be in China until 10 January with his wife Ri Sol-ju, according to state media reports. The visit comes amid reports that negotiations are under way for a second summit between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. The two met last June, the first such meeting for a sitting US president. Video: Inside train used by Kim on China visit North Korea's breakdown of communication Mr Kim met Mr Xi on Tuesday for about an hour, South Korean news agency Yonhap reports, citing unnamed sources, saying the pair discussed the possible US-North Korea summit. After their meeting Mr Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a dinner, Yonhap says. Speculation had grown on Monday that Mr Kim was possibly making his way to China after Yonhap reported that a North Korean train had been seen crossing the border. Dozens of security vehicles and officials blocked roads around the train station in the border town of Dandong. Hotel guests in Dandong had also not been allowed to enter rooms that faced the border, with Japanese news outlet Kyodo calling this an ""apparent move to prevent the train from being seen"". Mr Kim travelled to Beijing on his distinctive personal train Both countries' media confirmed the visit on Tuesday morning. Mr Kim's distinctive green and yellow train arrived at a station in Beijing later in the day. The train, the same one used during Mr Kim's first visit to China, resembles the one used by his father Kim Jong-il during his visits to China and Russia in 2011. A motorcade with heavy security was later seen driving through central Beijing. Mr Kim's visit, during which he is being accompanied by several leading North Korean officials, is his fourth to China in less than a year. Tuesday is also reportedly Mr Kim's 35th birthday, though his date of birth has never been confirmed by Pyongyang. China is an important diplomatic ally for North Korea, and one of its main sources of trade and aid. ""[Mr] Kim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,"" Harry J Kazianis, director of defence studies at the Centre for the National Interest, told Reuters news agency. Mr Kim's first visit to China came in March last year Mr Kim, unusually, did not meet Mr Xi for the first six years of his leadership of North Korea. But last year, he visited China three times. None of the trips was announced in advance. Korean soldiers cross border in peace North Korea's Kim gives warning to US The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says two of the trips, which took place ahead of the historic summits with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Mr Trump, were seen by some as a chance to co-ordinate strategy. The latest three-day visit, our correspondent says, is likely to fuel speculation that a second US-North Korean summit will take place soon. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said a location for another meeting between the two would be announced in the not-too-distant-future. Mr Trump told reporters in Washington DC that ""a good dialogue"" was taking place with North Korea, but that sanctions on Pyongyang would remain in place. North Korea condemns latest US sanctions In his annual new year's speech last week, Mr Kim said he was committed to denuclearisation, but warned that he would change course if US sanctions remained. Denuclearisation: The word Trump and Kim can't agree on Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? Diplomatic progress between Mr Trump and Mr Kim has stalled since the Singapore summit. Both parties signed a pledge at the time to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, though it was never clear what this would entail.

"Hyundai has shown off a small model of a car it says can activate robotic legs to walk at 3mph (5km/h) over rough terrain. Also able to climb a 5ft (1.5m) wall and jump a 5ft gap, the Hyundai Elevate could be useful for emergency rescues following natural disasters, it said. It was part of a project exploring ""beyond the range of wheels"", it added. The concept has been in development for three years and was unveiled at the CES technology fair in Las Vegas. ""When a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field. They have to go the rest of the way by foot,"" said Hyundai vice-president John Suh. ""Elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete."" Mr Suh also suggested that wheelchair users could be collected via the vehicles, which could ""walk"" up to the front door of a building with step-only access. Allow YouTube content?

"User @_0rbit tweeted new information every day in December A 20-year-old man has made a ""comprehensive"" confession that he was behind a data breach affecting hundreds of high-profile Germans, police say. Styling himself ""G0d"", he published private information about politicians, journalists, and celebrities on Twitter, under the username @_0rbit. Investigators said the man was still in education and living with his parents. The suspect said he acted alone and out of annoyance at statements made by the public figures he attacked. About 1,000 people were affected, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Politicians from every major political party except for the far-right AfD were targeted, although investigators said they had yet to find evidence of the suspect's political inclinations. Germany's federal criminal police (BKA) said the information published online included telephone numbers, addresses, credit card data, photographs, and private communications. Investigators said the German citizen they arrested had co-operated and led them to evidence they may not have found without help. Police are also still investigating seized computer hardware. In a statement, the BKA said he was detained after a search of his home in the state of Hesse on Sunday. He is accused of spying and the unauthorised publication of data. His provisional arrest, however, was lifted on Monday evening. He was released ""due to a lack of grounds for detention"", police said. They took into account both his age and his co-operation. The @_0rbit Twitter account has been suspended since coming to widespread attention late last week. Before then, it published the leaked information in an ""advent calendar event"" each day in December. Its biography had described itself as involved in ""security research"". Of the almost 1,000 politicians, celebrities and journalists affected by the leak, some 50 attacks were ""more serious"", involving private correspondence or photos, officials said. Angela Merkel, Greens leader Robert Habeck and TV satirist Jan BÃ¶hmermann have all been targeted by the attack Among those affected were: Chancellor Angela Merkel: her email address and several letters to and from the chancellor appear to have been published The main parliamentary groups including the ruling centre-right and centre-left parties, as well asThe Greens, left-wingDie LinkeandFDP. Only AfD appears to have escaped Greens leader Robert Habeck, who had private chats with family members and credit card details posted online Journalists from public broadcastersARDandZDFas well as TV satiristJan BÃ¶hmermann, rapperMarteriaand rap groupK.I.Z,reports say Another TV satirist,Christian Ehring,is said to have had 3.4 gigabytes of data stolen and posted online, including holiday photos. Last year he won a court case brought by AfD leader Alice Weidel, who complained when he called her a ""slut"" on his TV show. Centre-left SPD MP Florian Postsaid he felt ""quite shocked"" by the leak of account statements and other details online, but he added that at least one file that had been posted was fake. The fallout has created widespread alarm politically. Robert Habeck, leader of the Greens, deleted both his Twitter and Facebook accounts on Monday after being affected by the data breach. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, said he would introduce new data protection legislation in the next six months. The suspect has told police he acted alone. Investigators, quoted by DPA, said the 20-year-old had taught himself the skills he needed using online resources, and had no training in computer science. The private information seems to have been acquired over a substantial period of time in 2018 in what officials called a ""sophisticated"" operation, and added to publicly available information. He ""exploited several vulnerabilities"", investigators said, adding that several such security gaps have since been fixed. BKA chief Holger Munch told a news conference that the suspect ""gained access to various accounts, obviously using hacking methods"" - but that access to those accounts had now been taken away. It has also emerged that German officials knew of at least one attack last year, but thought it was an isolated case. The German Federal office for Information Security revealed it learned of one breach in early December On Saturday the BSI information security agency said that a member of the German parliament had reported suspicious activity on their email account in early December. In a statement, the agency said it was linked to the @_0rbit leaks only when the account's existence became known last week. German officials also said there was no evidence to suggest that government systems had been compromised. Nonetheless, the scandal has prompted calls for action to improve cyber-security practices.

"The government says it plans to build 250,000 homes by 2022 Three million new social homes must be built in England over 20 years to solve the ""housing crisis"", a report says. Housing charity Shelter said 1.2 million homes are needed for younger families who cannot afford to buy and ""face a lifetime in expensive and insecure private renting"". Existing schemes like Help to Buy are a less effective use of taxpayers' money, the report claims. The government said providing fair social housing was a priority. It plans to build 250,000 homes by 2022, including homes for social rent. Shelter said the report was partially inspired by the Grenfell Tower fire and the belief ""the disaster must mark a turning point in how we talk about social housing"". Social rent properties are currentlyset aside for those in most need and are let on long-term tenancies.,external Shelter's report claims 1.3 million homes are needed to house those in greatest need - including homeless people and those living with a disability. The charity estimates 277,000 people are homeless in England, most commonly because they have lost their privately rented homes. A lack of readily available social housing has led to a ""drop in the numbers of young families moving into ownership, the rise of pensioners in insecure unaffordable private rentals, and the homelessness that scars our society"", the report found. Kirsty is on the waiting list for social housing but says she is so low down that she does not know when she will be better off Kirsty, 26, lives with her daughters aged five and two. She split from their dad a year ago, and is struggling to afford her privately rented flat in Harlow. ""The first property we moved into was in terrible condition. We could never keep the place warm as it was single-glazed and the doors had holes in."" She and her children spent one month over Christmas without heating. ""My little girl had an operation during that time and she had to come home from hospital to a flat with no heating"", she said. ""The landlord just wasn't willing to fix anything. In the end we had to move, which cost me so much money I've now only got Â£6 in my bank account. ""The kids get the food they need and I eat the leftovers or whatever I can afford. ""I'd love to work but I just can't afford the childcare. It feels like whatever avenue I take I lose at something. ""I'm on the waiting list for social housing but I'm so low down - I just don't know how I'm ever going to be better off.' Emma, a survivor of the Grenfell Tower fire, waited seven months to be placed in social housing Emma and her partner lived in Grenfell Tower for five years, until they lost their home in the fire of June 2017. ""On the night of the fire, we were lucky to get out. The lift stopped at random floors on the way down, picking people up. After we got out at the ground floor, I don't think that lift ever went back up. ""It was only when we got outside that I saw how bad it was."" After seven months in temporary accommodation, Emma is finally in social housing. ""Moving in was a struggle as the flat flooded almost as soon as we got here - trying to get the management to fix that was difficult"", she said.

"Paul Gascoigne has previously protested his innocence on social media Ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, who is accused of sexually assaulting a woman on a train, told a court he has ""done nothing wrong"". The former England midfielder, 51, is accused of kissing the woman without her consent on board the service from York to Durham. During a 10-minute hearing at Teesside Crown Court, he elected to be tried by a jury and will stand trial in October. He repeated his not guilty plea to a charge of sexual assault by touching. During the hearing he was warned by the judge to be quiet, after calling out: ""Sir, Your Honour"", when told his trial would take place from 14 October. He then said he was ""worried to bits"", and ""scared"". When asked for his nationality in court, Mr Gascoigne replied: ""England, Protestant."" Recorder of Middlesbrough Simon Bourne-Arton granted him unconditional bail and warned him he must turn up for the trial. He said: ""I will do, your lord. I cannot wait.

"Arch-rivals Samsung and Apple have snuggled up together in Samsung's new Smart TVs Samsung has said that from spring 2019 its new smart TVs will include iTunes - software made by rival tech firm Apple. The move was ""a true first"", senior Samsung executive Dave Das told the CES tech show in Las Vegas. The service will offer sales and rentals of films and TV shows but not music. One analyst said the strategic move would benefit both companies. The deal comes ahead of Apple's expected launch of a rival to Netflix. Besides access to iTunes, the smart TVs will also feature AirPlay 2 support - allowing users to stream videos, photos and music from Apple devices. Samsung's previous generation of smart TVs will also gain the features via a firmware update. LG had earlier announced its new TVs would get AirPlay, but not iTunes. The BBC has contacted Apple to ask whether the iPhone-maker is paying Samsung to add iTunes. This video can not be played WATCH: Samsung's new shape-shifting TVs revealed It was a ""fascinating"" move, said Paolo Pescatore, an independent tech analyst.

Among Samsung's other TV announcements at CES was the unveiling of a new range of QLED 8K TVs, including a 98in (249 cm) model. The South Korean tech giant also used its keynote press conference to debut a new range of home appliances. These range from front-loading washing machines with an app that ""provides a recommended cycle depending on the specific items, item colours and level of dirt"". There was also a fridge that sends an alert to its owner's phone if the door is left open. Would you let this robot take your pulse? Finally, the company announced several robots tailored for specific tasks. Bot Care, for instance is designed to check people's blood pressure, pulse and heart rates.

"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: ""While I am glad about the victory that has been achieved today I am sad it was necessary to take this action."" The Scottish government has admitted acting unlawfully while investigating sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond. Allegations against the former first minister, which he denies, were made to the Scottish government a year ago. The government has now admitted it breached its own guidelines by appointing an investigating officer who had ""prior involvement"" in the case. As a result, it conceded defeat in its legal fight with Mr Salmond. Mr Salmond's case focused entirely on the fairness of the government's procedures and will have no bearing on a separate police inquiry into the allegations, which is still ongoing. Q&A: Alex Salmond legal victory Who is Leslie Evans? Look back at Sturgeon's statement Speaking outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said the case had resulted in ""abject humiliation"" for the Scottish government, which he led from 2007 until 2014. He added: ""The last time I was in that court was to be sworn in as first minister of Scotland. I never thought it possible that at any point I would be taking the Scottish government to court. ""Therefore while I am glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I am sad that it was necessary to take this action."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation that we are in today."" Mr Salmond also repeated his calls for the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, to consider her position, and warned that the case could cost the public purse Â£500,000. And he thanked the 4,000 people who contributed more than Â£100,000 to a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for his legal challenge to the government's handling of the case. With the government agreeing to pay his legal costs, he said the money will go to good causes in Scotland and elsewhere. The former first minister raised more than Â£100,000 for his case through a crowdfunding appeal The government's admission that it had not followed the correct procedures came during a hearing at the Court of Session on Tuesday morning. Judge Lord Pentland subsequently said that the government's actions had been ""unlawful in respect that they were procedurally unfair"" and had been ""tainted with apparent bias"". The Scottish government's admission centred on an official it appointed to investigate the complaints against Mr Salmond, which were made by two women. Its lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, told the court that the investigating officer was a ""dedicated HR professional"" who acted in good faith, but did have some contact with the complainers before being appointed to the case. This video can not be played Lord Pentland told the court the government acted unlawfully Mr Dunlop said this had led the government to accept there had been a ""failure"" in one aspect of the investigation, which could have given the impression that they were not acting impartially. But he said the government did not accept a claim by Mr Salmond's legal team that the investigating officer had effectively been ""assisting the complainers"" and ""giving them encouragement"". He also said there was ""no question of an individual being held up as a sacrifice"", and that the government had a ""duty to investigate the serious complaints"" that had been made. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she has not spoken to Mr Salmond since July of last year Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told BBC Scotland that ""in one particular aspect of the application of this procedure the Scottish government got it wrong"", but that there was ""no suggestion of any partiality in the process"". She also said it was ""not my view"" that Ms Evans, the Scottish government's permanent secretary, should resign. Ms Sturgeon asked Ms Evans to draw up new procedures for handling sexual harassment claims, which the first minister signed-off, shortly before the complaints against Mr Salmond were made in January of last year. The first minister said: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation we are in today, not least for the complainants who had a right to expect that this process would be in every respect robust. ""I think the permanent secretary was absolutely right when these complaints came forward to subject them to an investigation and not to sweep them under the carpet because of the identity of the person complained about. ""That principle remains - the Scottish government, like any organisation has a duty when it gets things wrong to learn the lessons so that people who have complaints in the future feel confident in bringing them."" Ms Sturgeon has backed her permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, despite Mr Salmond calling for her to resign She later told the Scottish Parliament that she had met Mr Salmond three times after the complaints against him were made -  at her home in Glasgow on 2 April, on 7 June ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, and at her home on 7 July. Ms Sturgeon added: ""I also spoke with him on the telephone on 23 of April and 18 July. I have not spoken to Alex Salmond since 18 July. ""On 2 April he informed me about the complaints against him, which of course in line with the procedure the permanent secretary had not done, and he set out his various concerns about the process. ""In the other contacts he reiterated his concerns about the process and told me about proposals he was making to the Scottish government for mediation and arbitration. ""However I was always clear that I had no role in the process and I did not seek to intervene in it at any stage, nor indeed did I feel under any pressure to do so."" There were smiles and handshakes for Alex Salmond's legal team at the Court of Session, but it was a day of mixed feelings for the former first minister. In the very room where he was sworn into Scotland's highest office, Mr Salmond found himself taking legal action against the government he once led. Addressing the media outside, the former SNP leader said he was at once ""delighted"" to have won, but ""sad"" that it had come about in court. And he turned almost every question to the future of the government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, who he says is responsible for the ""abject surrender"". He was careful not to direct any ire towards his successor, Nicola Sturgeon. She says she has full confidence in her most senior civil servant - and has insisted the government's processes are robust, despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure to apply them properly in this case. Away from the politics, this is the end of the judicial review, but it's by no means the end of the road. A police investigation into the complaints against Mr Salmond continues, and has not been affected by this court case in any way. And the government has confirmed that the complaints it received in January 2018 have not been withdrawn - so the option of re-investigating them remains on the table, once the police probe has run its course. In astatement released immediately after the case was resolved,external, Ms Evans said she wanted to ""apologise to all involved for the failure in the proper application of this one particular part of the procedure"", and in particular the two complainers. But she insisted: ""There is nothing to suggest that the investigating officer did not conduct their duties in an impartial way. ""Unfortunately, the interactions with the complainants in advance of the complaints being made meant that the process was flawed, however impartially and fairly the investigating officer conducted the investigation."" Ms Evans stressed that it was ""right and proper that these complaints were investigated"", and that the ""procedural flaw in the investigation does not have implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers"". And she said it was open to the Scottish government to re-investigate the complaints, adding that ""subject to the views of the complainants, it would be our intention to consider this"". But Ms Evans said this would ""only be once ongoing police inquiries have concluded"". A four-day hearing on the case had been due to begin at the Court of Session in Edinburgh next week, but that will now not go ahead. The allegations against Mr Salmond date back to 2013, when he was still first minister. He has described the claims as ""patently ridiculous"". The former MSP and MP, who lost his Westminster seat in the 2017 general election,resigned from the SNP in Augustbut said on Tuesday he wants to rejoin. Salmond 'sad' at taking government to court.

"MPs who do not want the UK to leave the EU without a deal are trying to limit the government's financial powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The House of Commons will vote shortly on a cross-party amendment to the Finance Bill, which enacts the Budget. Several senior figures back the move, but International Trade Secretary Liam Fox called it ""irresponsible"". No 10 said it would not stop tax being collected, describing the MPs' move as ""more inconvenient than significant"". Downing Street said the amendment, which could be voted on about 19.00 BST, was ""not desirable"" and Mrs May was striving to get her deal through Parliament. Meanwhile, minister Richard Harrington said he is prepared to resign to stop the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Harrington suggested to BBC Newsnight that others might follow suit, saying his position was ""not an uncommon one"". MPs will seek to turn the screw on ministers with Tuesday's amendment, which is intended to demonstrate to the government the strength of opposition to a no-deal Brexit in the Commons. LIVE: MPs debate finance bill Coveney criticises Brexit 'hardliners' Brexit vote: What could happen next? What's happening with the PM's Brexit conundrum? If passed, it would mean the government would not be able to raise certain taxes and take other financial steps arising from a no deal - unless Parliament had explicitly authorised the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March whether there is a deal or not. The deal which Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with the EU - which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has not been formally approved. Yvette Cooper says her amendment has support from Remain and Leave MPs Labour MP Yvette Cooper who, along with Conservative Nicky Morgan, is behind the amendment, said Parliament must act now to rule out a no-deal Brexit in the event of Mrs May's agreement being voted down next week and MPs being unable to agree any other course of action before the UK's exit in March. She told the BBC: ""There is a risk that we end up with no deal by accident, as a result of brinkmanship, delays and drift. ""That's why Parliament has to be sensible and say 'we have to rule out the worst option, the kind of damaging deal that would hit manufacturing industry and would also put our police and security at risk as well"".

Labour have said they will back the amendment, prompting speculation that ministers will be forced to accept it in order to avoid a damaging defeat. But Mr Fox, who backs Mrs May's deal, said it would be ""irresponsible to tie the government's hands"" at this stage by ruling out any options. Speaking at a technology fair in California, Mr Fox said it would not take the possibility of a no-deal exit off the table. ""The government has to ensure that all eventualities are covered,"" he said.

Five days of debate in the Commons will begin on Wednesday. The prime minister has said the UK will be in ""uncharted territory"" if the deal is not accepted although she has not ruled out asking the Commons to vote on it on several times prior to the 29 March deadline. Mr Harrington, a minister in the business department, told Newsnight he was confident that Britain would leave the EU with a deal as the stark reality facing the UK became clear. ""We will not be leaving with no deal,"" he said. ""I think people are beginning to realise that it's the prime minister's deal or there may not be a Brexit."" Richard Harrington said MPs had to choose between Mrs May's deal or no Brexit Asked whether he was prepared to resign to stop a no-deal Brexit, he replied: ""Definitely, I would... The prime minister knows everybody's views and I think my view is not an uncommon one."" Another minister, Margot James, suggested on Monday that Brexit may have to be delayed and negotiations extended under the Article 50 process if Parliament could not agree on the terms of withdrawal. The vote on the cross-party amendment is expected at about 19:00 GMT. Government sources warned over the weekend of ""paralysis"" and an effective ""shutdown"" if the Treasury was stripped of the power to pass regulations relating to ""no-deal financial provisions"" without parliamentary approval. One leading tax expert said ministers would still be able to make tax changes by introducing new clauses into future Finance Bills or introducing emergency legislation but would find it much ""more cumbersome"". ""Even if the clause were passed and there was a no-deal Brexit, the system could still function,"" Andrew Hubbard, a consultant at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM said.

"Amber Rudd raised concerns about a no-deal Brexit at the first cabinet meeting of the year Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, has said history will take ""a dim view"" of ministers if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. Ms Rudd told a cabinet meeting earlier that the UK would be less safe if there was a no-deal Brexit.

It is understood during Tuesday's Cabinet that Ms Rudd, a former home secretary who was a leading figure in the 2016 Remain campaign, told MPs history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid said no deal would limit the government's ability to return illegal immigrants to other EU countries. And Environment Secretary Michael Gove said that those considering rejecting Mrs May's agreement in the hope of securing a better deal ""were like swingers in their mid-50s waiting for film star Scarlett Johansson to turn up on a date"". Mr Gove suggested those holding out for another deal would remain unsatisfied Ms Rudd added ""or Pierce Brosnan"", only for Justice Secretary David Gauke to quip that it was like ""waiting for Scarlett Johansson on a unicorn"".

Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said the UK remains committed to leaving on 29 March after theDaily Telegraph,externalsaid UK officials had been ""putting out feelers"" about extending Article 50, the mechanism taking the UK out of the EU. Mr Barclay said he had not spoken to the EU about that and any delay would cause ""some very practical issues"". His remarks came the day after Digital Minister Margot James suggesting Article 50 might have to be extended in order to stop a no-deal Brexit if Mrs May's deal is rejected by Parliament. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said extending Article 50 was the ""default"" back-up plan for the EU if MPs did not agree to the Brexit deal, although he was not aware of any officials who had discussed it at this stage. A no-deal Brexit would see the UK leave without a withdrawal agreement and start trading with the EU on the basis of World Trade Organization rules, an outcome favoured by some Brexiteers. David Davis, one of Mr Barclay's predecessors as Brexit secretary, told the BBC the fact that EU officials were talking about re-opening negotiations ""tells you that Mr Barclay's assertion that this is the only deal on the table is not, actually, entirely accurate"". ""Because what actually is going on, is the Europeans are thinking about the next stage, and the next stage is another round of negotiation,"" he told Radio 4's Today.

"Young victims of sexual assault are not being forensically examined within a critical time period at some privately-run referral centres, a BBC investigation has found. Doctors also told the BBC they had seen cases of incorrect recordings of injuries and evidence contamination. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said the ""failings"" were ""shocking"". NHS England - which jointly commissions services - said it had not been made aware of the concerns. Following a sexual assault, victims are taken to sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) to be forensically examined. The first three days following a sexual assault is considered the key forensic window for young children because their injuries can heal quickly and DNA is less likely to be retained. The BBC has spoken to eight doctors who wanted to blow the whistle on the poor care they had seen at privately-run SARCs. There are many such centres across England, many of which are run by private companies. One of the doctors, who works across multiple centres, said she was aware of 10 cases in the past two years where pre-pubescent children were not forensically examined within three days of being assaulted because there was not a qualified member of staff available. ""Ten children missing out on forensic samples is quite a significant number,"" she said. ""When you lose the forensics, that's something you can't get back."" Doctors from centres across England also said in the past two years they had witnessed incorrect recording of bruises and injuries and at least three cases of contamination of forensic evidence. Dr Helena Thornton, who independently reviews forensic evidence for defence and prosecution cases, said she saw something that concerned her in a quarter of medical notes and evidence statements. Her work typically includes reviewing video recordings of genital examinations that have taken place at referral centres. Dr Helena Thornton said she saw something that concerned her in a quarter of medical notes and evidence statements ""I have seen one where gloves were not worn,"" she said. ""I have seen one which did not show the injuries that were documented to have been there."" Dr Thornton said another video showed a pre-pubescent child who was left ""beyond distressed"" after a swab was taken as part of a procedure that she says was totally unnecessary. ""If a parent thought their child was going to be distressed or hurt, I'm sure they would be appalled,"" she added. The BBC has learned that in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service conducted an audit of forensic evidence, which has never been published. An NHS doctor reviewed 13 cases that had gone to court whose examinations had all been conducted in one Primecare private centre in the Midlands. The CPS refused to provide the BBC with the audit, but under the Freedom of Information Act the information commissioner has now ordered its release. It revealed that only a single case provided ""acceptable documentation of injuries"" and the correct forensic samples were taken in just two cases. In one instance of rape, no samples were taken from the affected areas. According to the doctor reviewing the cases, one example of poor documentation of injuries ""would be fertile ground for cross examination by a defence barrister"". In a statement, the CPS said the centre ""fell short"" of standards but following the report they worked together and alongside the police to formulate an improvement plan. ""Significant improvement, involving this contract holder and generally, has been evident in the last nine years,"" it said. The CPS declined to answer whether they had conducted subsequent audits for any company in the UK. Allied Healthcare, who incorporated Primecare, said the audit was historical and the centre itself had been acquired three times by other providers since 2009. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said she was ""shocked by the failings the BBC has uncovered"". ""Some of the individual experiences are truly distressing,"" she said. ""It is unacceptable that there is no standardised training for staff taking forensic evidence, despite it being recommended over nine years ago. I want to see this happen as a matter of urgency."" Responsibility for the care provided in centres is shared between a range of bodies. However, Baroness Newlove called on governments in England to introduce annual inspections of SARCs. The Care Quality Commission - which regulates the healthcare provided but not the evidence gathered - said it had recently started a new inspection regime. But the BBC has learned that the forensic documentation produced at all centres will not be routinely reviewed, unlike at GP surgeries. The Forensic Science Regulator said it now planned to set up a whistle-blowing hotline for people with concerns. In a statement, it said it had been ""working to drive up standards and will continue to do so"". NHS England - which commissions services with Police and Crime Commissioners - said it had not been made aware of any of these concerns. In a statement it said: ""We would strongly encourage those involved to report these serious allegations to the forensic regulator. ""Sexual assault referral centres are important services which is why the NHS has tripled its funding over the past five years and has measures in place to make sure alongside the police that they are providing the care needed in a timely way."" Dr Faye Kirkland is also a GP.

"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: ""While I am glad about the victory that has been achieved today I am sad it was necessary to take this action."" The Scottish government has admitted acting unlawfully while investigating sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond. Allegations against the former first minister, which he denies, were made to the Scottish government a year ago. The government has now admitted it breached its own guidelines by appointing an investigating officer who had ""prior involvement"" in the case. As a result, it conceded defeat in its legal fight with Mr Salmond. Mr Salmond's case focused entirely on the fairness of the government's procedures and will have no bearing on a separate police inquiry into the allegations, which is still ongoing. Q&A: Alex Salmond legal victory Who is Leslie Evans? Look back at Sturgeon's statement Speaking outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said the case had resulted in ""abject humiliation"" for the Scottish government, which he led from 2007 until 2014. He added: ""The last time I was in that court was to be sworn in as first minister of Scotland. I never thought it possible that at any point I would be taking the Scottish government to court. ""Therefore while I am glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I am sad that it was necessary to take this action."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation that we are in today."" Mr Salmond also repeated his calls for the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, to consider her position, and warned that the case could cost the public purse Â£500,000. And he thanked the 4,000 people who contributed more than Â£100,000 to a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for his legal challenge to the government's handling of the case. With the government agreeing to pay his legal costs, he said the money will go to good causes in Scotland and elsewhere. The former first minister raised more than Â£100,000 for his case through a crowdfunding appeal The government's admission that it had not followed the correct procedures came during a hearing at the Court of Session on Tuesday morning. Judge Lord Pentland subsequently said that the government's actions had been ""unlawful in respect that they were procedurally unfair"" and had been ""tainted with apparent bias"". The Scottish government's admission centred on an official it appointed to investigate the complaints against Mr Salmond, which were made by two women. Its lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, told the court that the investigating officer was a ""dedicated HR professional"" who acted in good faith, but did have some contact with the complainers before being appointed to the case. This video can not be played Lord Pentland told the court the government acted unlawfully Mr Dunlop said this had led the government to accept there had been a ""failure"" in one aspect of the investigation, which could have given the impression that they were not acting impartially. But he said the government did not accept a claim by Mr Salmond's legal team that the investigating officer had effectively been ""assisting the complainers"" and ""giving them encouragement"". He also said there was ""no question of an individual being held up as a sacrifice"", and that the government had a ""duty to investigate the serious complaints"" that had been made. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she has not spoken to Mr Salmond since July of last year Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told BBC Scotland that ""in one particular aspect of the application of this procedure the Scottish government got it wrong"", but that there was ""no suggestion of any partiality in the process"". She also said it was ""not my view"" that Ms Evans, the Scottish government's permanent secretary, should resign. Ms Sturgeon asked Ms Evans to draw up new procedures for handling sexual harassment claims, which the first minister signed-off, shortly before the complaints against Mr Salmond were made in January of last year. The first minister said: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation we are in today, not least for the complainants who had a right to expect that this process would be in every respect robust. ""I think the permanent secretary was absolutely right when these complaints came forward to subject them to an investigation and not to sweep them under the carpet because of the identity of the person complained about. ""That principle remains - the Scottish government, like any organisation has a duty when it gets things wrong to learn the lessons so that people who have complaints in the future feel confident in bringing them."" Ms Sturgeon has backed her permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, despite Mr Salmond calling for her to resign She later told the Scottish Parliament that she had met Mr Salmond three times after the complaints against him were made -  at her home in Glasgow on 2 April, on 7 June ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, and at her home on 7 July. Ms Sturgeon added: ""I also spoke with him on the telephone on 23 of April and 18 July. I have not spoken to Alex Salmond since 18 July. ""On 2 April he informed me about the complaints against him, which of course in line with the procedure the permanent secretary had not done, and he set out his various concerns about the process. ""In the other contacts he reiterated his concerns about the process and told me about proposals he was making to the Scottish government for mediation and arbitration. ""However I was always clear that I had no role in the process and I did not seek to intervene in it at any stage, nor indeed did I feel under any pressure to do so."" There were smiles and handshakes for Alex Salmond's legal team at the Court of Session, but it was a day of mixed feelings for the former first minister. In the very room where he was sworn into Scotland's highest office, Mr Salmond found himself taking legal action against the government he once led. Addressing the media outside, the former SNP leader said he was at once ""delighted"" to have won, but ""sad"" that it had come about in court. And he turned almost every question to the future of the government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, who he says is responsible for the ""abject surrender"". He was careful not to direct any ire towards his successor, Nicola Sturgeon. She says she has full confidence in her most senior civil servant - and has insisted the government's processes are robust, despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure to apply them properly in this case. Away from the politics, this is the end of the judicial review, but it's by no means the end of the road. A police investigation into the complaints against Mr Salmond continues, and has not been affected by this court case in any way. And the government has confirmed that the complaints it received in January 2018 have not been withdrawn - so the option of re-investigating them remains on the table, once the police probe has run its course. In astatement released immediately after the case was resolved,external, Ms Evans said she wanted to ""apologise to all involved for the failure in the proper application of this one particular part of the procedure"", and in particular the two complainers. But she insisted: ""There is nothing to suggest that the investigating officer did not conduct their duties in an impartial way. ""Unfortunately, the interactions with the complainants in advance of the complaints being made meant that the process was flawed, however impartially and fairly the investigating officer conducted the investigation."" Ms Evans stressed that it was ""right and proper that these complaints were investigated"", and that the ""procedural flaw in the investigation does not have implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers"". And she said it was open to the Scottish government to re-investigate the complaints, adding that ""subject to the views of the complainants, it would be our intention to consider this"". But Ms Evans said this would ""only be once ongoing police inquiries have concluded"". A four-day hearing on the case had been due to begin at the Court of Session in Edinburgh next week, but that will now not go ahead. The allegations against Mr Salmond date back to 2013, when he was still first minister. He has described the claims as ""patently ridiculous"". The former MSP and MP, who lost his Westminster seat in the 2017 general election,resigned from the SNP in Augustbut said on Tuesday he wants to rejoin. Salmond 'sad' at taking government to court.

"Carlos Ghosn's court appearance has been headline news in Japan, including on public TV screens Former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn could be in jail for another six months, his lawyer says. On Tuesday, Mr Ghosn appeared in court for the first time since his shock arrest in Japan in November last year. Accused of financial misconduct,he told the court he had been ""wrongly accused and unfairly detained"".,external Mr Ghosn, 64, was once hailed as the man who saved Nissan. He was led into court in handcuffs with a rope around his waist. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure of the car industry, also looked visibly thinner. Carlos Ghosn: The relentless 'cost killer' Five charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Ghosn charged over pay accusations So far, Mr Ghosn has been arrested three times. His current detention period ends on 11 January. Asked whether his client could expect to be bailed at the end of this detention period, his lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, said: ""In general, in such cases in Japan, it is usually not approved before the first trial takes place."" He then said that it could be six months before that first trial was held. A crowd of reporters waited outside the court in Tokyo on Tuesday His initial arrest shocked the industry and his lengthy detention has drawn some criticism. But a judge said incarcerating Mr Ghosn was justified to prevent possible evidence-tampering and the risk that he might flee. Mr Ghosn, who was hailed as the man who saved Nissan by building alliance with Renault, has beenaccused of ""significant acts of misconduct"", including under-reporting his pay package and personal use of company assets. The 64-year-old executive is accused of moving personal investment losses worth 1.85bn yen (Â£13.3m; $17m) racked up on foreign exchange dealings to Nissan. Mr Ghosn says he did ask the company to take on collateral temporarily for his foreign exchange contracts, but that it did not lose any money through this move. He said if he had not been able to do this, he would have had to resign and use his retirement allowance as collateral instead. Mr Ghosn is also accused of making $14.7m in payments to Saudi businessman Khaled al-Juffali, using Nissan funds in exchange for arranging a letter of credit to help with his investment losses. If found guilty of the financial misconduct charges, Mr Ghosn faces up to 10 years in prison as well as a fine of up to 700m yen ($6.4m; Â£5m), according to Japanese regulators. He told the Tokyo District court: ""I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained, based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations."" Mr Ghosn said he had ""never been accused of any wrongdoing"" and had dedicated two decades to ""reviving Nissan"". The 64-year-old said he never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed. He was first arrested on 19 November for understating his pay andrearrested twice in December. His most recent arrest involved fresh allegations of breach of trust. Members of Carlos Ghosn's legal team ahead of his appearance at the Tokyo District court Who is Carlos Ghosn?

"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, pictured at Bangkok airport, says she ""wants to be free"" away from Saudi Arabia An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family at the weekend has reiterated her plea for asylum in Canada, the United States, Australia or the UK. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun refused to board a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she feared her family would kill her for renouncing Islam. She is now staying at a Thai government shelter while the UN refugee agency assesses her case. Her father and brother have arrived but she is refusing to see them. Arrested for disobeying your father Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi asylum seeker 'taken home' by family Renunciation of Islam, known as apostasy, is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Thai immigration officials had initially said she should return to Kuwait. In another development, Ms Mohammed al-Qunun said her passport had been returned. A Saudi diplomat had reportedly seized it when she flew into Thailand from Kuwait on Saturday. She has told the BBC that she is fine, and hoping to be granted asylum in a third country. She captured the attention of social media users around the world by live-tweeting every twist and turn in her story. Her brand new Twitter account attracted 50,000 followers in a day and a half. ""My life is in danger,"" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told Reuters news agency. ""My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things."" Her father is the governor of al-Sulaimi, a town in the northern Saudi province of Hail. A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. Human Rights Watch and other campaign groups have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. She had travelled to Thailand for a connecting flight to Australia, where she originally hoped to seek asylum. On Tuesday morning she retweeted her original appeal for asylum, adding in a subsequent tweet: ""I want Canada to give me asylum."" Allow Twitter content?

The Australian government said it was ""pleased"" the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) was assessing her claim. ""Any application by Ms al-Qunun for a humanitarian visa will be carefully considered once the UNHCR process has concluded,"" a Department of Home Affairs official said. The UN agency said it was ""very grateful"" that officials in Thailand had not deported her but her asylum claim would take ""several days"" to assess. Saudi Arabia's embassy in Thailand has denied that its government is seeking her extradition, Reuters news agency reports. On Monday evening local time, Thailand's chief of immigration police, Surachate Hakparn, said the country would ""take care of her as best we can"". ""She is now under the sovereignty of Thailand; no-one and no embassy can force her to go anywhere. ""Thailand is a land of smiles. We will not send anyone to die."" Thailand's chief of immigration police, Surachate Hakparn, said Thailand would not deport the young woman to her possible death Mr Surachate said he would meet Saudi diplomats to clarify Thailand's decision. Thailand's immigration chief told Reuters any meeting between the young woman and her father would have to be approved by the UN.

"Morrisons reported a rise in sales in the Christmas shopping period, while the market share of discounters Aldi and Lidl reached its highest-ever level for the festive season. David Potts, chief executive of the number four supermarket chain, said customers were ""increasingly savvy"". While the business was getting ready for Brexit, he said two-thirds of the produce it sold was from the UK. Morrisons' sales rose 3.6% in the nine weeks to 6 January. This increase in like-for-like sales, which strips out new store openings, was driven by a 3% rise in the wholesale division, which supplies Amazon and McColls. In the stores, sales rose 0.6% - more than the 0.5% expected by analysts - but there was a slowdown from the 1.3% in the third quarter andthe 2.1% reported last Christmas. Supermarkets battle over New Year price cuts Is it the end of the supermarket checkout till? Its shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down nearly 4%. Even as the company maintained its outlook for the 2018-19 financial year, Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said Morrisons remained under pressure from rivals in the so-called 'big four' and the discounters. ""A resurgent Tesco, the proposed Asda/Sainsbury alliance and the continuing advance of Aldi and Lidl all add to a challenging environment,"" Mr Hunter said. Morrisons said it had ""performed well, sustaining a strong offer and trading the business hard"" for customers. Mr Potts said that consumer behaviour had changed as he hailed the retailer's fourth consecutive Christmas of like-for-like sales growth. ""People became increasingly savvy and conscious of both the macro political situation in the country and how that may unfold in 2019 and how it may affect them personally,"" he said. While customer spending increased during the summer, while England were progressing through the World Cup, customers later became more cautious, he said. That has continued in the first few trading days of this year, when customers have continued to be cost-conscious, he said. On Monday, Morrisons said it would cut prices by an average of 20% on 935 products, including tinned tomatoes, cereals and multivitamins. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said 60% of supermarket customers this Christmas had been ""looking to make their money go further over the holidays"". According to Kantar's data for the 12 weeks to 30 December, discounters Aldi and Lidl had a combined market share of 12.7% over the festive period, their highest-ever for Christmas. Two-thirds of all households shopped at either Aldi or Lidl over the 12-week period, Kantar said. By its reckoning, Asda was top of the ""big four"" grocers, with a 0.7% rise in sales, and Sainsbury's the weakest, with a 0.4% decline. Morrisons is traditionally a lower-cost supermarket and in its trading update said it had kept prices of key Christmas items the same as last year. Customers' satisfaction - on measures such as ""colleague friendliness and checkout experience"" -  had ""increased significantly"", which it said was an important measure of its progress in turning around the business. Like-for-like sales across the group, including fuel, were up 3.4%. Total sales were up 4% excluding fuel. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director of Fidelity Personal Investing, said that ""tucked away in the Christmas trading update was what really attracted shoppers - not cheery staff and faster checkouts, but last year's prices"". Preparations for Brexit were continuing, Mr Potts said, but the retailer was not making assumptions about the eventual outcome. He said two-thirds of what it sold was made in Britain, where it also had 18 manufacturing sites. There would be slightly less reliance on EU labour, he said.

"Jason Dalton had initially blamed the Uber app for his actions, saying it made him a ""puppet"" An Uber driver accused of killing six people at random in a shooting spree in the US state of Michigan in 2016 has pleaded guilty to murder, attempted murder and firearms offences. Four people were killed at a restaurant and two at a car dealership in the shootings in the city of Kalamazoo. Jason Dalton, 48, had initially blamed the app for controlling his ""mind and body"". But he changed his plea shortly before his trial was due to begin. No deal was offered to Mr Dalton for the guilty plea, prosecutors said. His charges consist of six counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and eight charges relating to firearms offences. He now faces a mandatory life sentence without parole. Video: Kalamazoo shooting suspect hauled out of court Mr Dalton, who submitted his plea while jury selection was taking place, did so despite the objections of his attorney. He told the judge at the Kalamazoo County court that he had made the decision of his own free will, adding that he had ""wanted this for quite a while"". Mr Dalton had earlier reportedly told police that he was made a ""puppet"" by the Uber application, which directed him to shoot people at random over a five-hour period in February 2016. Although none of the victims were Uber customers, police said Mr Dalton continued to pick up passengers during the shooting spree in Kalamazoo, a small city about 150 miles (241km) west of Detroit. The shootings took place on a Saturday evening at three locations - outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a Kia car dealership and an apartment block. The first shooting took place outside a Kalamazoo residential building at about 17:30 local time (22:30 GMT). A woman was shot multiple times - reportedly in front of her children - and was taken to hospital in a serious condition At about 22:00 local time, a father and son were shot and killed and a third person was wounded at the car dealership At about 22:15, the third shooting took place in the car park of the Cracker Barrel restaurant. Mary Lou Nye, 62, of Baroda, Michigan, was killed along with Dorothy Brown, 74; Barbara Hawthorne, 68, and Mary Jo Nye, 60, all of Battle Creek, Michigan. A girl, 14, was gravely wounded Following his arrest that evening, Uber confirmed that Mr Dalton was a driver registered with the app-based cab-hailing company, issuing a statement saying that it was ""horrified and heartbroken"" at the violence. Mr Dalton had undergone background checks but passed because he had no criminal record, Uber said. 'Random' Michigan shootings kill six Uber shooting suspect hauled from court.

"This video can not be played 'John' joined far-right groups aged 15, but now works to prevent extremism The number of people referred to the UK's terrorism-prevention programme over concerns related to extreme right-wing activity jumped by 36% in 2017/18. Prevent, which aims to stop people being radicalised, received 7,318 last year, of which 1,312 were for far-right extremism, up from 968 the year before. Referrals for concerns related to radical Islamism decreased by 14%. Security minister Ben Wallace said the programme tackled radicalisation ""wherever it is found"". BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said a ""rise in extreme right-wing activity, particularly online"", was behind the increase in referrals. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, meanwhile, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of people referred to Prevent ""do not require any anti-terrorism procedures at all"". Thelatest figures,externalshow that, of those referred to Prevent in 2017/18: 3,096 (42%) left the process requiring no further action 2,902 (40%) left the process and were signposted to alternative services 1,314 (18%) were discussed by Channel, the programme that provides support to people who might be vulnerable to radicalisation Of the cases examined by Channel, 394 subsequently received support through the scheme, including 114 aged under 15. Engagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The controversial Prevent scheme is essentially a system which aims to  identify vulnerable people and intervene in their lives before something bad happens. The local panels - which include police, social workers and other experts - look at reports coming in from teachers, the public, the NHS and others. A huge proportion of these referrals are false alarms - in fact the number of cases which experts immediately dismissed rose 16% in the year to March 2018. The proportion of individuals who cause such concern that they need concerted help to de-radicalise, through the ""Channel"" mentoring programme, remains consistently low at about 5%. That's not to say that mistakes aren't made. This latest data covers the summer of 2017 when Surrey County Council's botched attempt to help turn around the life of Ahmed Hassan,the young man who later tried to bomb a London Underground train. The latest figures also showed thousands of children and teenagers have been flagged up over terror concerns. In the year to March, 2,009 under-15s were referred, including 297 girls. The number in the youngest age group increased by a fifth on the previous year, while more than half of those reported for possible de-radicalisation interventions in 2017/18 were 20 or under. Referrals over Islamist extremism concerns fell from 3,704 to 3,197. Reality Check: What is the Prevent strategy? Prevent criticism 'stems from ignorance' Greens say Prevent strategy 'toxic' The Home Office said that, of those who have left the Channel process, more than four in five did so with ""no further terrorism-related concerns"".

"The government says it plans to build 250,000 homes by 2022 Three million new social homes must be built in England over 20 years to solve the ""housing crisis"", a report says. Housing charity Shelter said 1.2 million homes are needed for younger families who cannot afford to buy and ""face a lifetime in expensive and insecure private renting"". Existing schemes like Help to Buy are a less effective use of taxpayers' money, the report claims. The government said providing fair social housing was a priority. It plans to build 250,000 homes by 2022, including homes for social rent. Shelter said the report was partially inspired by the Grenfell Tower fire and the belief ""the disaster must mark a turning point in how we talk about social housing"". Social rent properties are currentlyset aside for those in most need and are let on long-term tenancies.,external Shelter's report claims 1.3 million homes are needed to house those in greatest need - including homeless people and those living with a disability. The charity estimates 277,000 people are homeless in England, most commonly because they have lost their privately rented homes. A lack of readily available social housing has led to a ""drop in the numbers of young families moving into ownership, the rise of pensioners in insecure unaffordable private rentals, and the homelessness that scars our society"", the report found. Kirsty is on the waiting list for social housing but says she is so low down that she does not know when she will be better off Kirsty, 26, lives with her daughters aged five and two. She split from their dad a year ago, and is struggling to afford her privately rented flat in Harlow. ""The first property we moved into was in terrible condition. We could never keep the place warm as it was single-glazed and the doors had holes in."" She and her children spent one month over Christmas without heating. ""My little girl had an operation during that time and she had to come home from hospital to a flat with no heating"", she said. ""The landlord just wasn't willing to fix anything. In the end we had to move, which cost me so much money I've now only got Â£6 in my bank account. ""The kids get the food they need and I eat the leftovers or whatever I can afford. ""I'd love to work but I just can't afford the childcare. It feels like whatever avenue I take I lose at something. ""I'm on the waiting list for social housing but I'm so low down - I just don't know how I'm ever going to be better off.' Emma, a survivor of the Grenfell Tower fire, waited seven months to be placed in social housing Emma and her partner lived in Grenfell Tower for five years, until they lost their home in the fire of June 2017. ""On the night of the fire, we were lucky to get out. The lift stopped at random floors on the way down, picking people up. After we got out at the ground floor, I don't think that lift ever went back up. ""It was only when we got outside that I saw how bad it was."" After seven months in temporary accommodation, Emma is finally in social housing. ""Moving in was a struggle as the flat flooded almost as soon as we got here - trying to get the management to fix that was difficult"", she said. ""As social housing tenants, I just feel like we're not listened to. Someone should be held accountable. I want them to understand that it was our lives they were playing with.'

After six months in a homeless shelter, he and his eight-year-old son Billy moved into a permanent social home. ""The night before I was evicted, I was given a place in a homeless shelter. There were people there with serious mental health issues"", he said. ""I had my son Billy every weekend and it was not a good place for him to be. ""We now have a wonderful little one-bedroom flat, which is our home. The sheer satisfaction of hanging pictures on the wall with picture hooks rather than Blu Tack is incredible. ""Billy is more settled and is starting to make new friends."" The report was authored by 16 independent commissioners, including former Labour leader Ed Miliband, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, TV architect George Clarke and Grenfell survivor Ed Daffarn. Mr Miliband told BBC Breakfast the proposal would ""transform the fabric of the country, the lives of millions of people in the country"". ""It is a big sum of money but the problem is, the last labour government didn't do enough, and neither is the current government doing enough. ""In the years after the Second World War, governments - Labour and Conservative - built about 120,000 social homes and council houses every year. ""In the last 20 years or so - we've built 20,000 social homes per year - and that is one of the biggest causes of the housing crisis."" Former Labour leader Ed Miliband helped compile the report Building 3.1 million new social homes would cost an average of Â£10.7bn a year, according to analysis by research group Capital Economics on behalf of Shelter. But Shelter claims the government would save Â£60bn over 30 years if it can make renting cheaper. The family living in one room The bedrooms of London's most disadvantaged children Where can you afford to live?

"Young victims of sexual assault are not being forensically examined within a critical time period at some privately-run referral centres, a BBC investigation has found. Doctors also told the BBC they had seen cases of incorrect recordings of injuries and evidence contamination. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said the ""failings"" were ""shocking"". NHS England - which jointly commissions services - said it had not been made aware of the concerns. Following a sexual assault, victims are taken to sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) to be forensically examined. The first three days following a sexual assault is considered the key forensic window for young children because their injuries can heal quickly and DNA is less likely to be retained. The BBC has spoken to eight doctors who wanted to blow the whistle on the poor care they had seen at privately-run SARCs. There are many such centres across England, many of which are run by private companies. One of the doctors, who works across multiple centres, said she was aware of 10 cases in the past two years where pre-pubescent children were not forensically examined within three days of being assaulted because there was not a qualified member of staff available. ""Ten children missing out on forensic samples is quite a significant number,"" she said. ""When you lose the forensics, that's something you can't get back."" Doctors from centres across England also said in the past two years they had witnessed incorrect recording of bruises and injuries and at least three cases of contamination of forensic evidence. Dr Helena Thornton, who independently reviews forensic evidence for defence and prosecution cases, said she saw something that concerned her in a quarter of medical notes and evidence statements. Her work typically includes reviewing video recordings of genital examinations that have taken place at referral centres. Dr Helena Thornton said she saw something that concerned her in a quarter of medical notes and evidence statements ""I have seen one where gloves were not worn,"" she said. ""I have seen one which did not show the injuries that were documented to have been there."" Dr Thornton said another video showed a pre-pubescent child who was left ""beyond distressed"" after a swab was taken as part of a procedure that she says was totally unnecessary. ""If a parent thought their child was going to be distressed or hurt, I'm sure they would be appalled,"" she added. The BBC has learned that in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service conducted an audit of forensic evidence, which has never been published. An NHS doctor reviewed 13 cases that had gone to court whose examinations had all been conducted in one Primecare private centre in the Midlands. The CPS refused to provide the BBC with the audit, but under the Freedom of Information Act the information commissioner has now ordered its release. It revealed that only a single case provided ""acceptable documentation of injuries"" and the correct forensic samples were taken in just two cases. In one instance of rape, no samples were taken from the affected areas. According to the doctor reviewing the cases, one example of poor documentation of injuries ""would be fertile ground for cross examination by a defence barrister"". In a statement, the CPS said the centre ""fell short"" of standards but following the report they worked together and alongside the police to formulate an improvement plan. ""Significant improvement, involving this contract holder and generally, has been evident in the last nine years,"" it said. The CPS declined to answer whether they had conducted subsequent audits for any company in the UK. Allied Healthcare, who incorporated Primecare, said the audit was historical and the centre itself had been acquired three times by other providers since 2009. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said she was ""shocked by the failings the BBC has uncovered"". ""Some of the individual experiences are truly distressing,"" she said. ""It is unacceptable that there is no standardised training for staff taking forensic evidence, despite it being recommended over nine years ago. I want to see this happen as a matter of urgency."" Responsibility for the care provided in centres is shared between a range of bodies. However, Baroness Newlove called on governments in England to introduce annual inspections of SARCs. The Care Quality Commission - which regulates the healthcare provided but not the evidence gathered - said it had recently started a new inspection regime. But the BBC has learned that the forensic documentation produced at all centres will not be routinely reviewed, unlike at GP surgeries. The Forensic Science Regulator said it now planned to set up a whistle-blowing hotline for people with concerns. In a statement, it said it had been ""working to drive up standards and will continue to do so"". NHS England - which commissions services with Police and Crime Commissioners - said it had not been made aware of any of these concerns. In a statement it said: ""We would strongly encourage those involved to report these serious allegations to the forensic regulator. ""Sexual assault referral centres are important services which is why the NHS has tripled its funding over the past five years and has measures in place to make sure alongside the police that they are providing the care needed in a timely way.""

The visit comes amid reports that negotiations are under way for a second summit between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. The two met last June, the first such meeting for a sitting US president. Video: Inside train used by Kim on China visit North Korea's breakdown of communication Mr Kim met Mr Xi on Tuesday for about an hour, South Korean news agency Yonhap reports, citing unnamed sources, saying the pair discussed the possible US-North Korea summit. After their meeting Mr Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a dinner, Yonhap says. Speculation had grown on Monday that Mr Kim was possibly making his way to China after Yonhap reported that a North Korean train had been seen crossing the border. Dozens of security vehicles and officials blocked roads around the train station in the border town of Dandong. Hotel guests in Dandong had also not been allowed to enter rooms that faced the border, with Japanese news outlet Kyodo calling this an ""apparent move to prevent the train from being seen"". Mr Kim travelled to Beijing on his distinctive personal train Both countries' media confirmed the visit on Tuesday morning. Mr Kim's distinctive green and yellow train arrived at a station in Beijing later in the day. The train, the same one used during Mr Kim's first visit to China, resembles the one used by his father Kim Jong-il during his visits to China and Russia in 2011. A motorcade with heavy security was later seen driving through central Beijing. Mr Kim's visit, during which he is being accompanied by several leading North Korean officials, is his fourth to China in less than a year. Tuesday is also reportedly Mr Kim's 35th birthday, though his date of birth has never been confirmed by Pyongyang. China is an important diplomatic ally for North Korea, and one of its main sources of trade and aid. ""[Mr] Kim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,"" Harry J Kazianis, director of defence studies at the Centre for the National Interest, told Reuters news agency. Mr Kim's first visit to China came in March last year Mr Kim, unusually, did not meet Mr Xi for the first six years of his leadership of North Korea. But last year, he visited China three times. None of the trips was announced in advance. Korean soldiers cross border in peace North Korea's Kim gives warning to US The BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says two of the trips, which took place ahead of the historic summits with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Mr Trump, were seen by some as a chance to co-ordinate strategy. The latest three-day visit, our correspondent says, is likely to fuel speculation that a second US-North Korean summit will take place soon. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said a location for another meeting between the two would be announced in the not-too-distant-future. Mr Trump told reporters in Washington DC that ""a good dialogue"" was taking place with North Korea, but that sanctions on Pyongyang would remain in place. North Korea condemns latest US sanctions In his annual new year's speech last week, Mr Kim said he was committed to denuclearisation, but warned that he would change course if US sanctions remained. Denuclearisation: The word Trump and Kim can't agree on Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? Diplomatic progress between Mr Trump and Mr Kim has stalled since the Singapore summit. Both parties signed a pledge at the time to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, though it was never clear what this would entail.

"Police will be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones, the government has announced. The area around airports where drones are banned from flying will also be extended, and from 30 November operators of drones between 250g and 20kg will need to be registered. Labour said action on drones should have been taken years ago. Last month flights from Gatwick were suspended for more than 36 hours afterdrones were reported over the airfield. The plans follow aconsultation,externalinto the use of drones which began in July. The government said it would also expand technology to detect and repel drones from sites like airports and prisons, to prevent any repeat of events like those at Gatwick airport in December. How can a drone cause so much chaos? What punishment could a drone operator face? New legislation will give police additional powers to land drones and require users to produce the appropriate documentation. They will also be able to search premises and seize drones - including the electronic data stored within the device - where a serious offence has been committed and a warrant is secured. For minor drone offences, police will be able to issue fixed-penalty notices, with fines of up to Â£100 for offences such as failing to comply with an officer when instructed to land a drone or not showing the registration required to operate a drone. Registered drone users will also need to take an online competency test. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent Sometimes it's important to be seen to be doing something. That may well be the case with the government's plans to combat drone misuse. It had been planning action for some time - and had already held a major consultation on its proposals. Then came the dramas at Gatwick before Christmas. So would the new measures have made any difference in that situation? Probably not. Flying a drone close to an airport was already illegal, under legislation passed last year. The problem there was actually finding those responsible. But drone misuse is now a hot topic, so announcing these measures now, and widening the exclusion zone around airports, may help draw off some of the political flak. Meanwhile the Home Office will ""begin to test and evaluate the safe use of a range of counter-drone technology in the UK"". That may well be the wisest way forward. But critics are likely to ask why such testing wasn't already under way. After all, the threat was a known one, and it seems the Army at least had access to that kind of technology. Speaking in the Commons, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the disruption caused at Gatwick was ""deliberate, irresponsible and calculated, as well as illegal"" and any restriction zone around the airport would not have prevented an incident of this type. He said the problems at Gatwick were solved by ""smart and innovative use of new technology"", but declined to reveal what this was for ""security reasons"". He added that the Ministry of Defence remained ""on standby"" to deal with any further problems caused by drones at airports. Last year the government made it illegal to fly a drone above 400ft (120m) orwithin 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. The exclusion zone will now be extended to the current Air Traffic Zone around airports, which is approximately a 5km (3.1 miles) radius, with additional extensions from runway ends. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of up to five years. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the extension of exclusion zones around airports was likely to be welcomed by the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), which has lobbied for tougher rules. The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years. In 2013 there were zero incidents, compared with more than 100 last year. There has also been anincrease in the use of drones to smuggle drugs, mobile phones and other contraband into prisons. Labour's shadow transport minister Andy McDonald said while the measures were welcome, they should have been introduced sooner. ""Labour has repeatedly warned Department for Transport ministers over the last several years that they needed to take action on drones yet nowhere near enough has been done,"" he said. He added that the failure to bring forward detailed plans on drones had ""disastrous consequences"" and it was ""astonishing"" the government had no procedures in place to deal with events like those at Gatwick airport.

"Alex Hepburn denies two charges of rape A county cricket player raped a sleeping woman after setting up a sexual conquest ""game"" with friends on WhatsApp, a court heard. Worcestershire all-rounder Alex Hepburn allegedly attacked the woman after she had consensual sex with his team-mate Joe Clarke after a night out. Worcester Crown Court heard she had woken up to find Australian-born Mr Hepburn performing a sex act on her. The 23-year-old, of Portland Street, Worcester, denies two counts of rape. Mr Hepburn claims the alleged victim was awake and initial kissing led to consensual sexual contact. Opening the prosecution's case, Miranda Moore QC said the alleged victim realised she was not with Mr Clarke, who had left the room to be sick, when she touched Mr Hepburn's hair and he spoke in an Australian accent. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands She told jurors a member of the public dialled 999 after finding the woman, who cannot be identified, ""distressed and crying"" in the street in April 2017. Presenting WhatsApp messages found on Mr Hepburn's mobile, Ms Moore alleged that a ""stat chat"" group he took part in was set up to record details of women members had slept with. The rules said the ""winner"" would be able to gloat and enjoy a night out paid for by other members. Ms Moore said: ""He saw that girl asleep in the bed and decided to take advantage. ""That is what this case is about, this defendant's attitude to women."" A police interview with the complainant was also shown, where she told a police officer she had assumed she was having sex with Mr Clarke, before ""panic set in"" when she saw Mr Hepburn.

"This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry Speaker John Bercow has described the abuse and harassment of MPs outside Parliament as ""a type of fascism"" and called for a change of policing policy. He said recent incidents, includingTory MP Anna Soubry being verbally abusedon Monday, were ""intolerable"". At least 115 MPs have called on police to improve their response to abusive protesters outside Parliament. The Metropolitan Police has said it is ready to ""deal robustly"" with any instances of criminal harassment. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said the force was assessing whether any crimes had been committed, following a third-party report of a public order offence on College Green, opposite the Houses of Parliament. He said Scotland Yard will be ""enhancing the policing presence"" in the run-up to next week's vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal. Revised advice was issued to MPs by Parliament security on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a man has been arrested on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to get into Parliament. Armed officers arrested him at about 19:20 GMT on Tuesday after he got through Carriage Gates, at the entrance to the Houses of Parliament. He was taken to a police station, the Metropolitan Police said. The incident is not being treated as terror-related. Why do broadcasters use College Green? May: 'Be careful about language' on Brexit 'I'm frightened for my safety' - MP The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times."" Ms Soubry was shouted at - including being called a liar and a Nazi - during live TV interviews on BBC News and Sky. The former minister - a supporter of a fresh Brexit referendum - was later called ""scum"" and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. She criticised police for not intervening and called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""The real concern is the threat to democracy"" Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act means that ""threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour"" might be deemed a criminal offence. But Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) and Article 11 (right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association) of the European Convention on Human Rights contain the rights to peaceful protest. College Green is regularly used by media to interview politicians, as well as being a popular site for protesters to gather. Social media abuse of politicians' staff Abusive tweets to MPs 'more than double' Ms Soubry told the BBC she had ""no problem with people protesting"", saying this was a ""very small group of far-right extremists who just want to undermine democracy"". The MP for Broxtowe said: ""There is a very clear distinction between peaceful, lawful protest and robust debate - holding MPs to account, and it can be face to face - and some of the scenes we have seen in the last six weeks here at Parliament."" The cross-party group of MPs who have signed the letter - which includes those both for and against Brexit - said many of the concerns had been ""repeatedly raised"" with officers and senior policing staff. ""We write to express our serious concerns about the deteriorating public order and security situation in and around the exterior of the Parliamentary estate including College Green,"" the letter, co-ordinated by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, read. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""This situation cannot stand"" ""After months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far-right and extreme right connections - which your officers are well aware of - have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public."" The letter said there appeared to be a ""lack of co-ordination in the response from the police and appropriate authorities"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" Sky News presenter Kay Burley said the ""increasingly vile, aggressive and intimidating"" abuse had forced her to change her own route to Parliament and she now had to have security protection. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she had been interviewed three times by the police about the situation, but the protesters knew their rights and what they could and couldn't get away with. But she added: ""How far does it have to escalate before the police have to take it seriously?"" Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She pointed to the murder of MP Jo Cox,who was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency by right-wing extremist Thomas Mair in June 2016. Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was ""concerned"" about a ""pattern of protest"" targeting female MPs and journalists and called it a ""type of fascism"". In his letter to the Met Police chief on Tuesday, he said he recognised it was ""a difficult job striking the balance between allowing peaceful protests and intervening when things turn sour"". But he added: ""It's one thing demonstrating from a distance with placards, or calling out slogans - and another, where the protester invades the personal space of a member, subjects him or her to a tirade of menacing, racist, sexist and misogynistic abuse, and follows them back to their place of work."" Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick took up the job in 2017 Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has previously spoken out against online abuse, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that some protesters were ""organised right-wing groups"" trying to ""scare our politicians into making decisions based on fringe views"". ""People deserve to be safe at work,"" the Birmingham Yardley MP said. ""I didn't come here to be bullied by far-right bullies, far-left bullies, or anyone, we came here to do what we felt was best."" Also on Monday, political commentator Owen Jones published a video on Twitter that he had recorded while being followed and shouted at by a group of protesters outside Parliament. Last month, a video emerged of prominent Brexiteer Michael Gove being accosted by a protester dressed as Santa as he walked to Parliament. Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. Jump in far-right extremism referrals Far-right 'moving increasingly online' By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online far-right campaigner James Goddard. He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles. He told police outside Parliament they were ""fair game"" and ""if you want a war, we will give you a war"". Mr Goddard emerged as a DIY far-right campaigner last year as he began to gather followers after campaigning in support of the then-jailed anti-Islam activist, Stephen Lennon aka Tommy Robinson. Before the incident at Parliament involving Ms Soubry, he'd been helping to organise France-style ""yellow vest"" protests - including attempts to block bridges in London. Mr Goddard relies on donations from his followers - he frequently runs crowdfunding appeals for his campaigns. On Tuesday evening, Facebook confirmed it has closed his account. ""We will not tolerate hate speech on Facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke real-world violence,"" said a spokesman. Minutes later, his separate Paypal crowdfunding page disappeared too. No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". The BBC and other broadcasters have set up temporary studios on College Green ahead of the Commons vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal on 15 January. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said some MPs had expressed unease privately about being interviewed there, given the frequency and vehemence of the protests.

"This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry MP Anna Soubry has criticised police for not intervening after she was verbally abused outside Parliament. The Conservative ex-minister was accused ""of being a Nazi"", while being interviewed on the BBC News channel. She called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. The police said they were assessing if any crimes had been committed while Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was worried about a ""pattern"" of women MPs and journalists being targeted. Raising the issue in the House of Commons, Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She accused far-right groups of re-playing Monday's clip and others like it on social media sites to ""raise revenue for their trolling activities"". Ms Soubry, the pro-European MP for Broxtowe who supports another Brexit referendum, was subjected to verbal abuse while being interviewed by the BBC's Simon McCoy. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Protesters standing just a few yards from the entrance to Parliament accused her of being a liar and then chanted: ""Anna Soubry is a Nazi."" She was later shouted at and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. Reacting during the live interview, she told McCoy she ""objected to being called a Nazi"", adding that such language was ""astonishing  - and this is what has happened to our country"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" She said she would not be silenced nor intimidated but it was wrong that MPs and others doing their job in such a public space should ""have to accept this as part of the democratic process"". After the incident, she told BBC News the police needed to ""do their job"" and would contact them about the matter. The Metropolitan Police said they were investigating reports of a public order offence but no arrests had been made. The MP has already been in touch with the parliamentary authorities responsible for security. A number of MPs raised the matter with Mr Bercow at the end of a statement on the government's Brexit policy. Labour's Stephen Doughty called for ""proper action"" to be taken by the Metropolitan Police against those responsible for what he said were ""potentially unlawful actions"". And Conservative MP Nick Boles urged Mr Bercow to ensure everything possible was done to not only protect the right to freedom of speech but the right of MPs to move freely in and around Parliament in ""total safety"". Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. While the Met had responsibility for security outside the parliamentary estate, he said, he was keeping a ""close eye"" on the issue amid concerns that women, in particular, were being targeted. ""I share 100% the concerns expressed and it's necessary to state very publicly the difference between peaceful protest on one hand and the aggressive, intimidatory and threatening protest on the other."" Ms Creagh said there was a ""strong streak of misogyny"" in the wave of Brexit-related abuse directed against MPs. ""We in this place remember our friend Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right neo-Nazi,"" she said. ""We remember that people have gone to prison for plotting to murder another Labour MP and many people have been jailed for the abuse of other colleagues."" No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". A Downing Street spokesman said there were laws dealing with public order offences and cases of harassment and threatening behaviour.

"Jerry and Carole Tack: ""Hubby and me fell out big time... I didn't speak to him for about a week"" When Jerry Tack received an email saying the TV licence needed paying, he didn't think twice about it. Nothing seemed suspicious about the website he clicked on, so he entered his bank details - and began a chain of events that would lose him Â£9,900. Jerry, from Hampshire, was amongthousands contacted in what police called a ""particularly nasty"" fraud. But the banks say they cannot reimburse customers who have mistakenly authorised payments to fraudsters. A TV Licensing spokeswoman said: ""TV Licensing will never email customers, unprompted, to ask for bank details, personal information or tell you that you may be entitled to a refund."" Carole Tack, Jerry's wife, said that two days after filling in the fraudulent TV licence form online, he received a call purporting to be from his building society, Nationwide. In reality, it was a scammer who had harvested the 65-year-old's details from the fake form. The caller asked him about two fabricated transactions, and when he said he had not made them, they advised him to move his money into a ""safe account"". Jerry then received a text message with a code from the building society, most likely triggered by the scammers requesting it under a system designed for people who have forgotten their log-in details. Believing it had been sent by the person he was speaking to, he overlooked warnings not to share the code and gave it to the caller as confirmation. That inadvertently allowed the scammers to access his account. Thousands complain about TV licence scam Elderly 'under siege' from scammers They emptied two savings accounts of Â£4,000 each and persuaded Jerry to use a card reader to approve the transfer of the funds, as well as Â£1,900 from his current account, telling him it would protect the money from fraudsters. Half an hour later he had second thoughts and contacted Nationwide, to be told that he had been the victim of an ""authorised push payment"" (APP) scam. ""We were left penniless until the end of November,"" said Carole, 61. The loss of their savings put ""an awful lot of strain on our relationship"". ""Hubby and me fell out big time over it. I didn't speak to him for about a week,"" she said. ""Christmas for us was a complete wash-out. I didn't even put any decorations up - we didn't feel like it."" But while she acknowledged her husband had made a mistake, she felt financial institutions could do more to support victims of frauds such as this. Laura Hodson, 27, received a similar email saying payment details for her TV licence needed to be updated. ""The site looked very realistic and I think because it was due for renewal I didn't think it was unusual. The fines are so big that to do nothing panicked me more,"" she said. Laura Hodson and her partner Scott: Smiling now but they lost Â£2,500 to fraudsters More than 24 hours later she received a ""gut-wrenching"" call from her bank, RBS, to say that more than Â£2,500 had been taken. The payments were traced to a Barclays account and after about a month of wrangling Laura was told that only Â£2.21 could be recovered. ""We came across as a nuisance and that the scam was our entire fault,"" Laura said. Laura, a nurse from Dumfries, lost the money two days after payday at the end of October, leaving her and her partner Scott struggling to make ends meet and relying on the financial support of family. ""That was all taken away by a single email,"" she said. Banks say that the funds in these cases are frequently transferred to accounts owned by students being used by the scammers as ""money mules"". The cash is often impossible to recover because it is transferred between several accounts operated by mules in quick succession to avoid detection, before being withdrawn. UK Finance, a banking industry group, said it was introducing a new voluntary code for members setting out ""clear requirements for consumer protection and the principles for reimbursement"".
