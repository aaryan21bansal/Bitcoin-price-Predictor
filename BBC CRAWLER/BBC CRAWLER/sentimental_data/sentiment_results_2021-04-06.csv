"Qari Abdul Rauf was convicted of trafficking a child within the UK for sexual exploitation Fresh calls have been made to deport members of a notorious grooming gang after one of the men was spotted in the town where he abused young girls more than a decade ago. Qari Abdul Rauf, Abdul Aziz and Adil Khanwere jailed in 2012 for attacksin Rochdale, Greater Manchester. The trio have been facing deportation since 2018 after losing an appeal to retain their British citizenship. MP Tony Lloyd said the government had shown ""grossly unacceptable inaction"". The Home Office said the men's cases had recently been reviewed and it ""intends to update the victims through the proper channels when we can"". Rochdale's Labour MP Mr Lloyd was speaking after Rauf, now 51, was apparently photographed shopping in the town. He was said to have been stocking up a trolley with drinks at a store, as well as carrying a takeaway food delivery bag. Calls to deport 'appalling' grooming trio Grooming trio to lose British citizenship Child abusers 'not fazed' by convictions Mr Lloyd said it was ""unthinkable"" that the men's victims still face the possibility of ""walking round a street corner and bumping into them"". ""Particularly as we've had promises from successive home secretaries, not just in recent months, but over a good number of years now,"" he said. ""Quite frankly the inaction by the government is unthinkable and grossly unacceptable."" (L-R) Abdul Aziz, Adil Khan and Qari Abdul Rauf exploited girls as young as 13 Rauf, Aziz and Khan, who are Pakistani nationals, were among nine jailed for crimes including rape and trafficking of girls as young as 13. In some cases their victims, who were targeted from 2008, had been raped and handed to men who paid for sex with them in Oldham as well as Rochdale. The three men were given jail sentences of between six and nine years. Former police detective Maggie Oliver, who resigned over the way the cases were handled by Greater Manchester Police, said news of the sighting of Rauf had made her ""blood boil"". ""This is just the latest failure about how disgracefully the victims are treated, basically,"" she said. ""I'm in touch with them regularly and this is the latest in a long line of what they see as the criminal justice system failing them. ""I know these men have been out and about in Rochdale just carrying on with their lives as if they've done nothing wrong."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""What happened in places such as Rochdale remains one of the biggest stains on our country's conscience. ""The cases of the foreign national offenders involved in these crimes have recently been reviewed at the request of the home secretary and we intend to update the victims through the proper channels when we can.""

"Shareena Clanton has accused the Neighbours set of being a ""culturally unsafe space"" Two Aboriginal-Australian TV stars have alleged they witnessed racist incidents while working on the set of the popular soap opera Neighbours. Shareena Clanton alleged ""multiple racist traumas"" during her time on the show in an Instagram post on Monday. A day later, former Neighbours actor Meyne Wyatt said he too had experienced racism on set in a tweet. The actors, both Australians of indigenous descent, said they heard other cast members use racist slurs. ""It's been lonely, triggering and traumatising to work in such a culturally unsafe space,"" wrote Ms Clanton, who has guest starred in yet-to-be-aired episodes of Neighbours. In response to Ms Clanton's allegations, the show's producer, Fremantle Media, said it would do more to promote inclusion. ""Neighbours strives to be a platform for diversity and inclusion on-screen and off-screen,"" a spokesperson for Fremantle Media told the BBC. ""Our quest is always to continue to grow and develop in this area and we acknowledge that this is an evolving process."" Does Neighbours really represent Australia? National anthem changes to reflect indigenous past Australia admits failings on indigenous equality First broadcast in 1985, Neighbours follows the lives of the residents of Ramsay Street, in a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The soap was a launch pad for numerous pop and Hollywood stars, including Kylie Minogue and Russell Crowe. But the soap has been criticised for failing to reflect Australia's ethnic diversity in its casting of actors. Meyne Wyatt played the role of Nate Kinski in Neighbours Mr Wyatt was the first indigenous actor to be added to the main cast when he appeared on the show from 2014 to 2016. A spokesperson for Channel 5, which airs the soap in the UK, said it ""condemns racism and takes all allegations of discrimination seriously"". Best known for her role in Australian drama series Wentworth, Ms Clanton was hired to play a character named Sheila in upcoming episodes of Neighbours. In her Instagram post, Ms Clanton said she was ""navigating ongoing counselling"" from her stint on what she called a ""highly problematic show"". She made her allegations in a list of seven bullet points, without naming any individuals. One alleged that ""overt and covert levels of racism were rife"" on set. Allow Instagram content?

She cited several alleged examples of white actors using racist slurs, including two instances where she claimed the ""n-word"" was openly used. She alleged that she was told to ""go somewhere else"" when she confronted an actor who had used the slur ""because I was making others 'uncomfortable'"". ""The retaliation for calling out this misconduct and racism often left me ostracised and further marginalised,"" Ms Clanton wrote. Mr Wyatt expressed similar sentiments in his posts on Twitter. He said he walked in on someone using a racist insult, ""called it out and it didn't happen around me again"". Mr Wyatt said it was ""disappointing but not at all surprising"" to hear about Ms Clanton's allegations five years after he had left the show. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jack Colmer said he felt ""ashamed"" when he saw the piles of litter on Woodhouse Moor A university student built and installed a bin bag dispenser in a park where crowds left stacks of rubbish. Piles of litter were strewn across Woodhouse Moor, in Hyde Park, Leeds, last week as groups gathered amid warm weather and the easing of lockdown measures. Jack Colmer, 22, said he had felt ""ashamed"" so built the black bag device as a potential solution. He said he hoped his creation would help people to keep the park tidy. Drinks bottles and waste were left strewn across the grass at the park Leeds Beckett University student Mr Colmer, who is from Newcastle, said: ""After the images were released of Hyde Park and the mess it just annoyed me because I try and clean up after myself. ""I do a lot of DIY and building in my spare time as a hobby so I just started putting something together, making it up as I went along, and it eventually ended up as a bin bag dispenser. ""The litter in the place was unacceptable and I think as a community we can do better than that. ""I genuinely believe that people don't want to litter but they never really have the supplies or the bin bags there on the day to do it so, hopefully, this will encourage people to go grab a bag and pick their stuff up."" Jack Colmer said he had felt ""ashamed"" to see the pictures of the rubbish at Hyde Park Mr Colmer said he had received lots of positive messages since he installed the dispenser, with one local bar even offering him a tab which he said he was looking forward to spending once pubs reopen. He also said he hoped his efforts would help remove the ""bad image"" surrounding students and littering. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Kim Kardashian West at Paris Fashion week last year US reality TV star Kim Kardashian West has joined the elite club of the super-rich (in case anyone had any doubts) by achieving billionaire status. Her net worth reached $1bn (Â£720m) thanks to her cosmetics and clothing interests as well as income from TV, endorsement deals and investments, Forbes business magazine says. She is now one of the 2,755 figures on Forbes' World's Billionaires List. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leads the pack with a net worth of $177bn. Other Americans added over the past year include Bumble dating app founder Whitney Wolfe Herd ($1.3bn), filmmaker Tyler Perry ($1bn) and Miriam Adelson ($38.2bn), widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Kim Kardashian West's estranged husband Kanye West is already onthe list,external($1.8bn) buther half-sister, Kylie Jenner, was removed last May by Forbes. The magazine alleged her family had inflated the value of her cosmetics business. Forbes calculated that the 40-year-old'sworth had risen to $1bn from $780m in October,externalthanks especially to her stakes in the KKW Beauty cosmetics business and the Skims shapewear company. KKW Beauty was launched in 2017 and Skims just two years ago after the initial brand name Kimono wasdropped following accusations of cultural appropriation. Ms Kardashian West sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics giant Coty last year for $200m, in a deal valuing the business at $1bn. Her most recent project Skims offers underwear and loungewear in the founder's signature minimalist style, and has proven successful during the work-from-home era. The celebrity has used her huge social media presence (213m followers on Instagram; 69.7m followers on Twitter) during the coronavirus lockdowns to promote Skims loungewear. She first found fame in 2007 as the star of the E! Television reality series about her family, Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has remained hugely popular since. In February she reportedly filed for divorce from rapper Kanye Westafter being married for almost seven years and having four children together.

"This video can not be played Claims all over-50s in Wales have been offered a Covid jab have been questioned Claims all over-50s and at-risk adults with underlying health conditions have been offered a Covid vaccine in Wales have been disputed. Some people in those groups have said they are still waiting to be contacted to have their jab. It comes after the Welsh government said on Monday it had alreadymet the mid-April milestone targetset for all UK governments. On Tuesday, it said ""plans are in place to make sure no-one is left behind"". Public Health Wales (PHW) has said people should contact their health board. Garry Edwards, 51, from Anglesey, is registered as asthmatic and said he was still waiting for his invitation. He said he was previously told by his surgery only second jabs were being given, so he called Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board which confirmed he was on the list and would be called. When will I get the vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many people have died with Covid in Wales? ""I know a lot of people who have had, and a lot of people younger than me who have had it - I know people in their 40s who have had it,"" Mr Edwards said on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers. ""It's going to be done when it's done but when you are told you are going to be invited to have it... and it hasn't happened, then the statistics are wrong somewhere."" Other listeners to the programme messaged to say they were also still waiting for a first vaccine. Beverley Williams, 57, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was still waiting to hear about her vaccine through Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board. ""I've had Covid before so I'm a bit stressed,"" she said. ""I rang them this morning and they are going to send me another letter and if I don't hear anything by next week, I've got to ring them again. ""My husband's [vaccine] was late and he only found out he missed his because they rang him to find out why he hadn't turned up."" She added he was then booked in for the jab the same day as the call. Graham Thomas said it was ""really annoying"" his 84-year-old mother Marion Price was still waiting for her vaccine in Caerphilly. ""She has asthma and [lung disease] COPD. She's disabled and can't get out of the house."" He said she had received an offer to come to the surgery, but it was known she was housebound: ""She has to have a home visit. She's got a letter saying she is on the priority list but she hasn't had a vaccine."" Sonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi moved to Bangor, Gwynedd, last summer from Italy. The 50-year-old is registered with a GP but has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment. Ms Milano said: ""I phoned her GP surgery today and was told if nothing has happened by then, to call again. ""Everybody else around us over 50 has been offered one. I just want to make sure she will get a call."" Sonja Milano's mother Manuela Levi, 50, has been told to wait two more weeks for news of a vaccine appointment Dr Giri Shankar, incident director for the Covid-19 response at PHW, said vaccinations were delivered by health boards. ""I can't think of any systematic issue that would have led to several people having not received their vaccinations,"" he said. ""There may be isolated cases where that has happened, which obviously needs to be looked into, and the health boards are best placed to do that. ""Without looking into the specific details of each of those cases, it's difficult to say what might have happened, but I think the main thing to say is it's never too late. ""If you feel you haven't been given an appointment, you should immediately make contact with the health board."" In a statement, the Welsh government said: ""Any person aged 50 or over will have had at least their first vaccination or been sent an appointment, and plans are in in place to make sure no-one is left behind. ""If health boards have been unable to contact someone on the list, or if an appointment has been missed, systems are in place to go back and check and re-arrange a new appointment for anyone who wants to be vaccinated."" Information is available onthe Welsh government website,externalfor people who think they should have had an appointment but have not received one. Dr Mair Hopkin said she thought cases of people not being offered the vaccine were ""few and far between"" Dr Mair Hopkin, joint chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, said she did not think there was ""potentially a problem"" with delivering the vaccine. She said she had heard cases of people not being offered the vaccine were ""few and far between"". ""There may be very many reasons why people have been left off a list,"" Dr Hopkin said, citing people moving house and records not being updated. Dr Hopkin expressed concern younger people could be harder to reach for vaccination since they could be in education or at work and not ""sitting there waiting for that phone call"". She said it was important the young were vaccinated even if they thought they were not at risk. ""You have to remember that you are putting everyone one else at risk,"" she said. On Monday,PHW said 1,493,192 people had received a first doseof the vaccine and 469,251 people were fully vaccinated, having had both jabs. The Welsh government also said on Monday it had achieved its ""second milestone"" of offering a vaccine to everyone over the age of 50 and those with underlying health issues. But Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, said it was on track to meet the UK's mid-April target by 18 April. Chief executive Steve Moore encouraged people to get in touch to secure their first vaccine dose if they have not yet had an appointment. He added: ""We have seen an overwhelming response from our wonderful communities across the three counties who have turned up in storms, snow, rain and sunshine to receive their vaccine."" Betsi Cadwaladr health board's primary and community care boss, Dr Chris Stockport, said the ""vast majority"" of appointments for unvaccinated people in groups five to nine were now booked. Invitation letters, he said, were ""sent in the post last week"". ""Most of these letters have been delivered, but a small number may arrive in the coming days, because of bank holiday postal arrangements,"" Dr Stockport said. A ""significant number"" of invitations had also been sent to people in their 40s, he said. ""We are determined to not leave anybody behind,"" he said. The uptake of first doses of those in their early 50s across Wales on average was up to 67.2%, while for those in their late 50s, the figure stands at more than 84%. The top four priority groups in Wales, which is made up of all over-70s, including care home residents,were offered a jab by mid-February.

"Shops, restaurants and bars will offer QR barcode check-ins once restrictions ease England and Wales' contact tracing app will soon ask users to share details of venues they have checked in to, if they test positive for the coronavirus. The update to the NHS Covid-19 app will be deployed ahead of shops reopening in both nations on 12 April, as well as outdoor hospitality in England. The authorities will be able to use the information to tell other visitors if they need to be tested for the virus. But the system has been designed to protect users' anonymity. ""The app has been designed with user privacy in mind, so it tracks the virus not people, and uses the latest in data security technology to protect privacy,"" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care. Until now, the QR barcode-scanning facility only came into use if local authorities themselves flagged a location as being a virus hotspot by other means. This would then trigger a process whereby each phone could check if it had been at one of the affected venues on the dates concerned, and send the owner an alert. But the facility has rarely been used, despite more than 106 million check-ins. In March,Sky News reported that ""capacity issues at a local level"" were blamed for this,external, with overburdened health protection teams unclear about what they were supposed to do. The decision to automate the system via users' own actions could help address this. The QR barcode posters are being relaunched with a simplified design ahead of 12 April People might have reservations about disclosing where they have been and when. To address this,the Department of Health has said a,external""privacy-protecting"" approach is being taken. The app will only share venue history data if users opt in. And rather than any names or other personal details being disclosed, the software will simply inform the system when an infected user had visited the locations. Depending on the thresholds set - for example how many infected users visited the same place on the same day - other app users can then be told to either monitor their symptoms or immediately get a test, whether they feel ill or not. It is not intended that the check-in tool be used alone to force others to self-isolate. ""People shouldn't be worried about this as effectively they aren't being asked where they were, but rather where an unidentified person testing positive with Covid was,"" commented Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey. Further details will be revealed in a forthcoming revision to the app'sdata protection impact assessment (DPIA) document,external. Privacy advocates have, however, raised concerns about a parallel system being run in Scotland. Users there are being asked to use a new app - Check In Scotland - to register at venues. The Check In Scotland app was launched on 18 December It is separate to the Protect Scotland contact-tracing app, and thus not bound to the same privacy-preserving measures demanded by Google and Apple, which provide some of the technology involved. Check In Scotland uploads the name, email address and mobile phone number of each user to a ""secure"" centralised database along with the time of their visit to each venue. The justification given,externalis two-fold: ""a genuine concern"" that users might delete their logs of visited venues prior to a warning being received to allow Test and Protect workers to make direct contact with those judged to be at risk of contagion from sharing a venue with an infected person Users are told the data should only be used to try to combat the virus. But the DPIA acknowledges that the information could, in theory, be disclosed for other purposes if demanded via a court order or ministerial direction. Some experts are concerned this leaves the door open to it being ""misused"". ""The concern is that this infrastructure, once in place, is unlikely to go away because the coronavirus will be with us for a long time,"" said Prof Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights at University College London.

"Not all energy marketed as green comes from renewable sources Great Britain's electricity system was the greenest it had ever been at lunchtime on Easter Bank Holiday Monday, its operator has said. Sunny and windy weather, coupled with low demand for power, led to a surge in renewable sources of energy, National Grid Electricity System Operator said. It meant low-carbon energy sources made up almost 80% of Britain's power. There was no coal generation on the grid and just 10% of power was from gas plants, the operator added. The National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) said levels of carbon pollution for each unit of electricity consumed dropped to just 39 grams of carbon dioxide - the lowest ever recorded for the grid - at 13:00 BST on Monday. It said wind power made up 39% of the energy mix, with solar at 21% and nuclear accounting for 16%. The burning of biomass accounted for around 4%. There isdebate over the environmental costsof burning biomass, like wood, and the National Grid ESO categorises it separately from low-carbon sources and fossil fuels. By comparison,on Tuesday,external, 24.8% of Britain's energy came from fossil fuels, most of which was gas (combined cycle), while 45.2% was renewable energy sources. Those fossil fuel figures have been dropping all year. InJanuary,external, gas accounted for more than 43% of the energy mix, with coal at almost 5%, and then last month just37% of Britain's electricity was generated from gas,external. Could the coronavirus crisis finally finish off coal? Why are people not doing more about climate change? How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? The previous record for Great Britain's greenest day was set during lockdown last year, on 24 May. When Britain went into lockdown, electricity demand plummeted and the National Grid responded by taking power plants off the network and the four remaining coal-fired plants were among the first to be shut down. The new record may be a cause for celebration as the UK strives for a near zero-carbon society - but it's far from a surprise. Take the ingredients of a sunny, windy day on a bank holiday when factories are not working - coupled with a lockdown, and you're sure to cook up an impressive percentage of wind power. But remember, as investment in renewables increases, these records will be happening regularly. The real test for renewables comes when we face a cold, still, overcast February day when demand for heat and light soars and wind power is non-existent. That will need much more energy storage than is currently available. The government aims to have almost all electricity produced from low carbon sources by 2030 - and despite this week's impressive results, there's still a very long way to go. Last year as a whole saw many records broken for Britain's electricity mix, withan almost 68-day coal-free run between 10 April and 16 June, and solar providing more than a third of electricity supplies on several occasions during May. Christmas 2020 was also the first ever coal-free Christmas Day. Meanwhile, the highest ever amount of electricity generated by wind was on 13 February this year. This video can not be played Here are some coal-fired power stations being demolished over the years Fintan Slye, director at National Grid ESO, said: ""This latest record is another example of how the grid continues to transform at an astonishing rate as we move away from fossil fuel generation and harness the growth of renewable power sources. ""It's an exciting time, and the progress we're seeing with these records underlines the significant strides we're taking towards our ambition of being able to operate the system carbon free by 2025."" A decade ago about 40% of Britain's electricity came from coal The record comes ahead of COP26, a UN international climate change summit, due to be held in Glasgow this November. Kate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, praised the progress on taking fossil fuels out of the energy mix, but added that it was ""no time for the UK government to rest on its laurels"". ""Carbon emissions from our homes, farms and roads remain stubbornly high, and only a major government intervention can unblock the impasse,"" she said. ""As the Glasgow climate summit looms closer, ministers really need to up their game on tackling UK carbon emissions right across the board."" Why are people not doing more about climate change? Do governments meet their green targets? Could the coronavirus crisis finally finish off coal? The search widens for hot rocks that provide power How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? Enough renewables to meet 90% electricity demand Britain goes coal free as fossil fuels edged out You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too?

"Under the plans, existing buildings at Leeds Bradford Airport would be demolished and a new terminal built A Â£150m proposal to redevelop Leeds Bradford Airport has been delayed to allow Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick more time to consider it. Plans to demolish existing buildings and build a new terminal were approved by Leeds City Council in February. But that decision was referred to the government after objectors said it would contribute to climate change. The government said it needed time to allow for ""proper consideration"" of requests for the plan to be called in. More stories from Yorkshire A date for a final decision has not been set, but the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has put in place an order which prevents Leeds City Council from granting planning permission without special authorisation. Leeds Bradford Airport said the new terminal was not an expansion as it could already expand passenger numbers with its existing facilities. It added that the replacement building would be a more efficient and sustainable development helping it to achieve its carbon net-zero goals by 2023. Campaigners had urged councillors to reject the Â£150m scheme for Leeds Bradford Airport A spokesman for Leeds Bradford Airport said: ""We acknowledge the deadline extension and hope the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government will uphold Leeds City Council's approval for our replacement terminal, which will deliver thousands of new jobs and support the region's economy."" The airport estimates the project will support 12,650 permanent jobs across the Leeds City Region, as well as creating 850 construction-related jobs. The site handles about four million passengers annually and has already been granted permission to increase that to seven million over a 10-year-period. In July 2020, a group of climate scientists warned the expanded airport's greenhouse gas emissions would be higher than those allowed for the whole of Leeds in 10 years' time. Environmental campaigners Greenpeace said the delay over a final decision on the redevelopment plans was a sign the government was ""starting to clock the catastrophic impacts of this proposed expansion"". Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK's head of politics, said: ""But we're just months away from hosting critical global climate talks, and this climate-wrecking mega project is clearly incompatible with our plans to cut emissions, so why only delay the decision and not just call it in now?"" Meanwhile,in a tweet,external, the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport, said: ""No airport anywhere should expand. Delaying this decision is good news."" Mr Jenrick's decision to - in effect - kick this local issue into the long grass has national significance because seven other airports as well as Leeds Bradford also want to expand their operations. They'll all be less optimistic now. To be clear, the Leeds plan isn't dead. But it doesn't bode well for the airport that Mr Jenrick says he needs more time to decide whether to kill it or not. His note to the airport didn't spell out his reasoning, but it's reasonable to assume Mr Jenrick wanted to avoid another bruising like the one he suffered recently after tacitly approving a plan for a coal mine in Cumbria. He wasforced into a U-turn on that issue. So when will we get a final ruling? The government won't say, but my guess is we'll have to wait for the government's transport decarbonisation strategy due in the coming months that will show how all emissions from transport can be reduced.

"The image shared by MP Robbie Moore shows two adults walking with a child between the railway tracks Two women pictured walking along a railway line with a pushchair have been branded ""totally irresponsible"". The pair were seen with a young child on the the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway (KWVR) heritage line on Sunday. Staff said the heritage line, which was used to film the 1970 classic The Railway Children, was still used ""intensively"" for training runs. A local MP said encouraging children to walk on the tracks was ""dangerous, risky and totally irresponsible"". KWVR operations manager Noel Hartley said trespassing had increased during the last year due to false assumptions the line was not being used. ""It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening to see people blindly carrying on doing it regardless of the risks involved,"" he said. ""We have been running engineering trains throughout all of this."" While passenger services were currently suspended, Mr Hartley said engines had been passing every 40 minutes during the past week. Keighley's Conservative MP Robbie Moore, who shared the image taken on Sunday afternoon, said: ""Trespassing on the railway is illegal and dangerous - please stay safe and do not do it."" Mr Hartley added: ""We've had people taking photos of others doing handstands on the rails last summer, a dog-walking business taking dogs for a walk. ""But it's taking kids for a walk on the railway which is really silly - it starts to instil the idea in children that it's OK to trespass on the railway property.""

Today's live page has been brought to you by Alex Therrien, Alexandra Fouche, Doug Faulkner, George Wright, Holly Wallis and James Clarke. France has opened large vaccination centres We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day. Here's a round-up of the day's biggest developments around the world: We'll be closing up for the day shortly but here is a reminder of what has been happening across the UK today: As we reported earlier a comedy club in Liverpool received a deluge of abuse after it wasinaccurately reported to be involved in a Covid vaccine passport schemeover the weekend. Now the Hot Water Comedy Club says as a result of ""misleading press releases/media articles and the confusing messaging on the official government website"" it has made the decision not to be part of any government programme. ""We have still not managed to speak to anybody in the government about this,"" a statement says. Stuart Jones said he thought people would now be ""much more willing"" to shop on the High Street again We've been hearing a lot over the past few days about how people in the UK are feeling about the route out of lockdown. Stuart Jones says he is âlooking forward to finally
openingâ his personalised garment printing business in Romsey, Hampshire, for
the first time next Monday - 12 April. The 41-year-old took on a lease in September and
was all set to open in November but was stopped by the second lockdown. He then decided against opening the business at
Christmas for many reasons, the main one being what he saw as a âweariness
around the pandemicâ. Back then, Stuart, who is from Romsey himself, thought people would be less likely to shop
on the High Street but now he hopes with more people vaccinated, shoppers will return and support local businesses again. Stuart says: âNow weâre on the road to freedom, Iâve had my
first vaccine and it feels like thereâs light at the end of the tunnel and
people are much more willing to shop on the High Street again. âI know I will be looking to shop on the High Street again and support independent shops with a boost that's desperately needed.""  A man and a woman walk their dog in Vancouver Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has warned of a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeping the country. ""Around the world, countries are facing a very serious third
wave of this pandemic,"" Trudeau tells a news conference. ""And
right now, so is Canada."" Hospitalisations are rising rapidly and intensive care beds are filling up as variants spread, he warns. Canada has averaged almost 5,200 new coronavirus cases per
day over the past week. Ontario - the nation's most
populous province - was put into a limited lockdown over the weekend, but some
local health officials are calling for stronger restrictions. More than 23,000 Canadians have lost their lives to the virus. Discussions about a possible link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots are continuing. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should listen to medical regulators and keep getting their jabs. But some EU countries recently paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns. And as we've told you in the past half hour, a trial of the vaccine on childrenhas been pausedwhile those behind it await more information from UK regulator the MHRA. Regulators are carrying out a review into reports that a very small number of recently-immunised people suffered an extremely rare form of blood clot, called a cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). In the UK, 30 people have developed the clots - and seven have died as a result - out of 18 million people who have received the vaccine. Regulators and experts say the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, and no link has been established. Read morehere. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes Footage of Rwandan newlyweds and family guests forced to spend their wedding night in a stadium for breaching coronavirus rules has sparked criticism. Spending the evening at a stadium ""on my wedding day is a bad memory that will never fade in my life"", one bride has told the BBC anonymously. ""Inflicting pain and shaming people like this doesn't make us fear corona or observe measures."" Police in the capital, Kigali, had stopped at least three weddings over the Easter weekend because they exceeded the maximum of 20 attendees. A police spokesperson told Rwandan media ""more people doing parties are violating the measures"", and police wouldn't allow it to continue. Some people online said police were ""now going too far"" by unlawfully holding people for hours at night in stadiums, while others praised officers for taking action to ""keep them safeâ. Clarisse Karasira, a Rwandan music star, tweeted ""this act lacks humanity"", and said it was ""an eternal pain to the couple and their children"". Rwandaâs response to Covid-19 has been praised internationally, but activists and opposition have deplored deep human rights violations in the process. The country has recorded more than 22,000 cases of Covid-19 and 311 deaths. BBC Radio 5 Live The boss of the relaunched Thomas
Cook holiday brand has told the BBC vaccine passports could be welcomed by the travel industry if it means foreign travel can open up again. The 179-year-old Thomas Cook Groupcollapsedin 2019, but was resurrected as an online-only travel agentlast year. Its chief executive, Alan French, earlier today told BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up to Money: âI think the vaccine passport does look like itâs going to be part of the tool set that allows people to travel. âI can see within the travel business the passport being a player. âAt the moment, the travel industryâs having to react very flexibly. If the vaccination passport can help in any way, that would be helpful for us,â he said. Thomas Cook Group collapsed in 2019 but was relaunched as an online travel agent last year. He has joined other travel industry voices calling on the governmentfor greater clarity. ""For us, the signals are positive, but the details as to how people can travel are missing,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""hopeful"" foreign travel can begin again on 17 May. French says he's âlooking forwardâ to an industry report from the government'sGlobal Travel Taskforce,externaldue to be published next Monday, which is expected to recommend measures designed to facilitate the return of international tourism as quickly as possible. Anna CollinsonHealth Correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial on children and teenagers has been paused while the UK regulator investigates whether there's a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Prof Andrew Pollard from Oxford University has told the BBC while there are no safety concerns with the trial itself, the paediatric clinical trial will not give any further vaccinations while they await for additional information from the MHRA. Participants in the trial are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions. About 300 volunteers signed up for the trial which started in February. Researchers are assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17.
Updates from the European Medicines Agency and the MHRA are expected in the coming days. You can read more here. The number of patients in hospital in England with Covid-19 has dropped to its lowest level for six months, figures show. A total of 2,588 patients were in hospital at 08:00 BST, according to figures from NHS England. This is the lowest since the number was 2,435 on 4 October, and is down 92% from a record 34,336 on 18 January. During the first wave of the virus, patient numbers peaked at 18,974 on 12 April. Hospital admissions in England of patients with Covid-19 are at their lowest level for nearly seven months, with 156 admissions reported on Sunday, 4 April. This is the lowest since 153 on 13 September and is down 96% from the peak on 12 January. The fall in patients and admissions reflects the combined impact of the lockdown and vaccines in helping reduce the number of infections that need hospital treatment. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent All
medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe
side effects. The
seasonal flu jab has about a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve
disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. The
key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits. Even
if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest
about one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK. For
everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid
infections. For
those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000. On
the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination if you assume you are going to be
infected at some point. But what is needed now is more information about who has been
suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any
underlying health conditions that could explain what happened? This
will help narrow down the
scale of any potential risks. An
update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the
coming days. The United States is further ramping up its vaccination programme, which has accelerated since Joe Biden took office in January. The Biden administration says all adults will be eligible for a jab by 19 April - almost two weeks earlier than the previous target. President Biden is expected to speak about the vaccination effort later today. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, tells reporters: ""The president will announce officially later this afternoon that we've reached 150 million shots in arms since entering government and that by 19 April all adult Americans will be eligible to get the vaccine. ""That doesn't mean they will get it that day, it means they can join the line that day if they have not already done that beforehand."" Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The process of unlocking society confronts us with a dilemma that will mould the politics of the coming months: what is, simultaneously, epidemiologically safe and yet ethically, practically and politically possible? Having to prove you're not contagious - because you've been jabbed, tested or have immunity - is the very essence of this debate, because without that, argue some, how can social distancing be abandoned in the summer, while providing reassurance that is safe? The government calls its exploration of this idea ""Covid status certification."" But critics, including about 40 Conservative MPs, think it reeks of a ""papers, please"" society; an ID card in all but name. Ministers acknowledge the idea raises ethical issues. It raises colossal practical ones too: the NHS has been asked to look into what ministers call a ""digital and non-digital route"" to demonstrating your Covid status. An app and a scrap - of paper - in other words. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs said today the idea would ""lead to a two-tier Britain entirely incompatible with freedom"". And Labour are sceptical too. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have expressed a cautious openness to the idea of a domestic Covid certificate.  Northern Ireland's Health Minister says he doesn't support them. Egyptian authorities have launched an investigation after the body of a coronavirus victim was dug up from a grave and then burnt. According to local media, the remains were those of a hospital nurse who had died of the disease in Helwan, south of Cairo. Such is the stigma surrounding the virus in Egypt there have been reports of some communities being very reluctant to allow its victims to be buried in their cemeteries. In April last year,23 people were arrested for blocking the burial of a doctor who reportedly died with coronavirus. The group were believed to have feared a body buried with the virus could spread it. This video can not be played One of the positive impacts of lockdown is that there has been a big reduction in light pollution. A nationwide star count found a 10% drop in the amount of people who could only see 10 or fewer stars, an indicator of severe light pollution. Light pollution can impact human health and wildlife by disturbing biological cycles and behaviours. The BBC's Justin Rowlatt visited the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, an area that benefits from some of the darkest skies in England, to explore the impact of having less light pollution. Three in five UK adults have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab, the health secretary says. Some 31,622,367 have received a first vaccine, with 5,496,716 people now fully vaccinated thanks to a second dose - 10.4% of the adult population. Matt Hancock says it is ""fantastic"" news and has tweeted his thanks to ""everyone involved in the vaccine rollout"", saying ""we're making great strides in our national effort"". More than 37 million jabs have been given in the UK - 31.6 million first doses and just under 5.5 million second The president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, has been vaccinated with the Chinese coronavirus jab, Sinopharm, in an attempt to encourage reluctant Serbians to follow suit. A poor uptake prompted the government last month to invite in foreigners to get inoculated. Several thousand Bosnians took up the offer. A similar number marched through the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Tuesday in protest at their own government's failure to secure enough doses - fewer than 200,000 for a population of 3.5 million. Critics say Serbia's apparent generosity was a sign of its desire to restore its regional dominance, and that the Russian and Chinese vaccines on offer have not been approved for use in Europe. Thousands took to the streets in Sarajevo Meanwhile, in Slovakia fresh doubts have been raised about a controversial stock of Russian vaccine. The drug regulator has reportedly found the unused batch is different from the Sputnik vaccine reviewed by the medical magazine the Lancet. Slovakia PM Igor Matovic resigned last week over the furore caused by his decision to buy the stock without consultation. You can see from these graphs hospitalisations and new Covid cases continue to decline in the UK. You can also see the shift in the government's vaccine rollout to focus on second doses, with more of these now being given than first jabs.

around the pandemicâ. Back then, Stuart, who is from Romsey himself, thought people would be less likely to shop
on the High Street but now he hopes with more people vaccinated, shoppers will return and support local businesses again. Stuart says: âNow weâre on the road to freedom, Iâve had my
first vaccine and it feels like thereâs light at the end of the tunnel and
people are much more willing to shop on the High Street again. âI know I will be looking to shop on the High Street again and support independent shops with a boost that's desperately needed.""  A man and a woman walk their dog in Vancouver Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has warned of a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeping the country. ""Around the world, countries are facing a very serious third
wave of this pandemic,"" Trudeau tells a news conference. ""And
right now, so is Canada."" Hospitalisations are rising rapidly and intensive care beds are filling up as variants spread, he warns. Canada has averaged almost 5,200 new coronavirus cases per
day over the past week. Ontario - the nation's most
populous province - was put into a limited lockdown over the weekend, but some
local health officials are calling for stronger restrictions. More than 23,000 Canadians have lost their lives to the virus. Discussions about a possible link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots are continuing. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should listen to medical regulators and keep getting their jabs. But some EU countries recently paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns. And as we've told you in the past half hour, a trial of the vaccine on childrenhas been pausedwhile those behind it await more information from UK regulator the MHRA. Regulators are carrying out a review into reports that a very small number of recently-immunised people suffered an extremely rare form of blood clot, called a cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). In the UK, 30 people have developed the clots - and seven have died as a result - out of 18 million people who have received the vaccine. Regulators and experts say the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, and no link has been established. Read morehere. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes Footage of Rwandan newlyweds and family guests forced to spend their wedding night in a stadium for breaching coronavirus rules has sparked criticism. Spending the evening at a stadium ""on my wedding day is a bad memory that will never fade in my life"", one bride has told the BBC anonymously. ""Inflicting pain and shaming people like this doesn't make us fear corona or observe measures."" Police in the capital, Kigali, had stopped at least three weddings over the Easter weekend because they exceeded the maximum of 20 attendees. A police spokesperson told Rwandan media ""more people doing parties are violating the measures"", and police wouldn't allow it to continue. Some people online said police were ""now going too far"" by unlawfully holding people for hours at night in stadiums, while others praised officers for taking action to ""keep them safeâ. Clarisse Karasira, a Rwandan music star, tweeted ""this act lacks humanity"", and said it was ""an eternal pain to the couple and their children"". Rwandaâs response to Covid-19 has been praised internationally, but activists and opposition have deplored deep human rights violations in the process. The country has recorded more than 22,000 cases of Covid-19 and 311 deaths. BBC Radio 5 Live The boss of the relaunched Thomas
Cook holiday brand has told the BBC vaccine passports could be welcomed by the travel industry if it means foreign travel can open up again. The 179-year-old Thomas Cook Groupcollapsedin 2019, but was resurrected as an online-only travel agentlast year. Its chief executive, Alan French, earlier today told BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up to Money: âI think the vaccine passport does look like itâs going to be part of the tool set that allows people to travel. âI can see within the travel business the passport being a player. âAt the moment, the travel industryâs having to react very flexibly. If the vaccination passport can help in any way, that would be helpful for us,â he said. Thomas Cook Group collapsed in 2019 but was relaunched as an online travel agent last year. He has joined other travel industry voices calling on the governmentfor greater clarity. ""For us, the signals are positive, but the details as to how people can travel are missing,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""hopeful"" foreign travel can begin again on 17 May. French says he's âlooking forwardâ to an industry report from the government'sGlobal Travel Taskforce,externaldue to be published next Monday, which is expected to recommend measures designed to facilitate the return of international tourism as quickly as possible. Anna CollinsonHealth Correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial on children and teenagers has been paused while the UK regulator investigates whether there's a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Prof Andrew Pollard from Oxford University has told the BBC while there are no safety concerns with the trial itself, the paediatric clinical trial will not give any further vaccinations while they await for additional information from the MHRA. Participants in the trial are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions. About 300 volunteers signed up for the trial which started in February. Researchers are assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17.
Updates from the European Medicines Agency and the MHRA are expected in the coming days. You can read more here. The number of patients in hospital in England with Covid-19 has dropped to its lowest level for six months, figures show. A total of 2,588 patients were in hospital at 08:00 BST, according to figures from NHS England. This is the lowest since the number was 2,435 on 4 October, and is down 92% from a record 34,336 on 18 January. During the first wave of the virus, patient numbers peaked at 18,974 on 12 April. Hospital admissions in England of patients with Covid-19 are at their lowest level for nearly seven months, with 156 admissions reported on Sunday, 4 April. This is the lowest since 153 on 13 September and is down 96% from the peak on 12 January. The fall in patients and admissions reflects the combined impact of the lockdown and vaccines in helping reduce the number of infections that need hospital treatment. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent All
medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe
side effects. The
seasonal flu jab has about a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve
disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. The
key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits. Even
if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest
about one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK. For
everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid
infections. For
those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000. On
the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination if you assume you are going to be
infected at some point. But what is needed now is more information about who has been
suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any
underlying health conditions that could explain what happened? This
will help narrow down the
scale of any potential risks. An
update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the
coming days. The United States is further ramping up its vaccination programme, which has accelerated since Joe Biden took office in January. The Biden administration says all adults will be eligible for a jab by 19 April - almost two weeks earlier than the previous target. President Biden is expected to speak about the vaccination effort later today. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, tells reporters: ""The president will announce officially later this afternoon that we've reached 150 million shots in arms since entering government and that by 19 April all adult Americans will be eligible to get the vaccine. ""That doesn't mean they will get it that day, it means they can join the line that day if they have not already done that beforehand."" Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The process of unlocking society confronts us with a dilemma that will mould the politics of the coming months: what is, simultaneously, epidemiologically safe and yet ethically, practically and politically possible? Having to prove you're not contagious - because you've been jabbed, tested or have immunity - is the very essence of this debate, because without that, argue some, how can social distancing be abandoned in the summer, while providing reassurance that is safe? The government calls its exploration of this idea ""Covid status certification."" But critics, including about 40 Conservative MPs, think it reeks of a ""papers, please"" society; an ID card in all but name. Ministers acknowledge the idea raises ethical issues. It raises colossal practical ones too: the NHS has been asked to look into what ministers call a ""digital and non-digital route"" to demonstrating your Covid status. An app and a scrap - of paper - in other words. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs said today the idea would ""lead to a two-tier Britain entirely incompatible with freedom"". And Labour are sceptical too. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have expressed a cautious openness to the idea of a domestic Covid certificate.  Northern Ireland's Health Minister says he doesn't support them. Egyptian authorities have launched an investigation after the body of a coronavirus victim was dug up from a grave and then burnt. According to local media, the remains were those of a hospital nurse who had died of the disease in Helwan, south of Cairo. Such is the stigma surrounding the virus in Egypt there have been reports of some communities being very reluctant to allow its victims to be buried in their cemeteries. In April last year,23 people were arrested for blocking the burial of a doctor who reportedly died with coronavirus. The group were believed to have feared a body buried with the virus could spread it. This video can not be played One of the positive impacts of lockdown is that there has been a big reduction in light pollution. A nationwide star count found a 10% drop in the amount of people who could only see 10 or fewer stars, an indicator of severe light pollution. Light pollution can impact human health and wildlife by disturbing biological cycles and behaviours. The BBC's Justin Rowlatt visited the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, an area that benefits from some of the darkest skies in England, to explore the impact of having less light pollution. Three in five UK adults have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab, the health secretary says. Some 31,622,367 have received a first vaccine, with 5,496,716 people now fully vaccinated thanks to a second dose - 10.4% of the adult population. Matt Hancock says it is ""fantastic"" news and has tweeted his thanks to ""everyone involved in the vaccine rollout"", saying ""we're making great strides in our national effort"". More than 37 million jabs have been given in the UK - 31.6 million first doses and just under 5.5 million second The president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, has been vaccinated with the Chinese coronavirus jab, Sinopharm, in an attempt to encourage reluctant Serbians to follow suit. A poor uptake prompted the government last month to invite in foreigners to get inoculated. Several thousand Bosnians took up the offer. A similar number marched through the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Tuesday in protest at their own government's failure to secure enough doses - fewer than 200,000 for a population of 3.5 million. Critics say Serbia's apparent generosity was a sign of its desire to restore its regional dominance, and that the Russian and Chinese vaccines on offer have not been approved for use in Europe. Thousands took to the streets in Sarajevo Meanwhile, in Slovakia fresh doubts have been raised about a controversial stock of Russian vaccine. The drug regulator has reportedly found the unused batch is different from the Sputnik vaccine reviewed by the medical magazine the Lancet. Slovakia PM Igor Matovic resigned last week over the furore caused by his decision to buy the stock without consultation. You can see from these graphs hospitalisations and new Covid cases continue to decline in the UK. You can also see the shift in the government's vaccine rollout to focus on second doses, with more of these now being given than first jabs.

"Petrol bombs were thrown at police in Carrickfergus on Monday night Forty-one police officers have been injured as a result of violence in Northern Ireland in recent days. On Monday, petrol bombs were thrown in Carrickfergus, a car was set alight in Londonderry and nine officers were injured in disorder in Ballymena. Police said the officers were injured after they tried to engage with people present at an un-notified parade. In total, 10 arrests have been made across Northern Ireland during disorder over the past week. On Tuesday, First Minister Arlene Fosterurged young people not to get a criminal record by getting involved in violence. But she also said confidence had gone in the senior management of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)over the decision by prosecutors not to charge anyone over the Bobby Storey funeral. ""It is right that people speak out, but it is right that we say to those young people that two wrongs don't make a right,"" she said. There was a police presence in Larne on Tuesday evening Mrs Foster said she had spoken to the chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland to offer her support to rank-and-file officers. ""The chief constable needs to resign, and needs to resign quickly. Confidence is gone in his leadership, and confidence is gone in his senior management team."" Protesters gathered at a roundabout in Larne, County Antrim, on Tuesday evening On Tuesday evening, about 80 loyalist protesters took part in a peaceful demonstration at the Antiville roundabout in Larne, while police looked on. The A8 was closed in both directions for a short time but has since reopened. There were reports of minor trouble in nearby Linn Road in the town.

Social media footage showed a number of masked men taking part in a loyalist band parade in the Jervis Street area of Portadown. Police attended another night of disorder in the Waterside area of Derry on Monday night The police and political parties have repeatedly called for calm, with the disturbances blamed on loyalist frustrations over a PPS (Public Prosecution Service) decision not to prosecute people who attended the large-scale funeral of republican Bobby Storey in June 2020, as well as concerns about the NI Protocol in the Brexit deal. The leaders of the DUP, UUP and TUV have called for Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign over the PSNI's handling of the funeral, which was attended by a number of senior Sinn FÃ©in politicians, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. The NI Protocol has increased checks and caused disruption for some goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. NI assembly to be recalled over loyalist violence Police chief condemns rioters after Derry attacks PSNI officers injured in south Belfast riot Third night of trouble in County Antrim There has been a concern that loyalist anger would eventually make its way onto the streets. You could say the writing was on the wall - literally - since January and growing tension over the Irish Sea border. But there is a melting pot of grievances, largely bottled up by lockdown. This ranges from policing, to politics to societal problems. The rioting was low-level, relatively scattered and localised - there is no sense of a broader, joined-up orchestration. And then there were incidents - unlawful marches - where there was no violence at all. In short, no one reason sparked successive days of unrest. Several agendas are at play, including the South East Antrim UDA kicking back at the PSNI after a clampdown on its criminality. Once on the streets, will things gather momentum? Or will a combination of police action against rioters and a de-escalation of tension and political rhetoric calm things down? Pieces of masonry that were thrown at police officers in Carrickfergus on Sunday Ch Supt Davy Beck said he believed there were a number of ""small disaffected groups that are linked to criminality that are involved in orchestrating and promoting this violence"". He said while there were tensions across communities there was ""no justification for violence and attacks on police officers and members of public"". ""When our officers have arrived to deal with situations they are met with petrol bombs, debris, wheelie bins and that takes a degree of orchestration - which is evidence this is not spontaneous,"" he added. The senior police officer said he did not want to see young people being criminalised. ""Not only did their reckless and criminal behaviour place the lives of our officers in danger, but such senseless behaviour shows the blatant disregard those responsible have for the safety of others by throwing debris onto a motorway. ""It is extremely fortunate no one was seriously injured, or worse.""

"Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans. The prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a ""fact of life"" for people travelling internationally in future. The government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. However, the prime minister said he had ""not given up"" on the idea. Under plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. No isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to Â£200 each. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren But earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases. Asked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can. ""The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible."" Mr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government ""wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it. ""If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destinationâ¦ [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities."" 'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Scientists and ministers recently warnedthat holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are ""unlikely"". But Mr Johnson said he ""had not given up"" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly However,other travel industry figures called for clarityfollowing the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing. The Business Travel Association said the announcement was ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". Its chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had ""once again been kicked down the road"". ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,"" he added. The boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down. He said that overall, there were ""glimmers of good news"", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. ""But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April. But Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path. ""Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidaysâ¦ that just won't come this week."" She added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions.

"The International Monetary Fund is now forecasting a stronger economic recovery this year and next. The IMF has upgraded both its UK and global forecasts compared with what it projected in January. But the British economy is still predicted to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity only in late 2022. The agency also warns that recoveries are diverging dangerously within and between countries. The new UK forecast is for growth of 5.3% this year and 5.1% in 2022. Both figures are upgrades, though the latter is only marginally higher than the January forecast. The recovery follows last year's pandemic driven contraction of 9.9% which was the deepest of any of the G7 major developed economies. Bringing in the two predicted recovery years, the UK's performance over 2020 to 2022 would be ahead of one of the G7 countries, Italy. The new global forecasts are growth of 6% and 4.4% this year and next. Both are upgrades, a fairly modest one for 2022. That mainly reflects up-rating to the forecast for developed economies, especially the United States. In a blog on the forecasts, the IMF's chief economist Gita Gopinath says a way out of the health and economic crisis is increasingly visible. Vaccinations, she writes, are likely to power recoveries in many countries in 2021. But she is also concerned about how those recoveries are diverging. Countries with slower vaccine rollouts, more limited support from economic policy, and those more reliant on tourism are likely to do less well. The first two of these are particular issues for developing countries. Many have less access to vaccines, and they also tend to find it more difficult to finance economic and health policy actions. Among emerging and developing economies, China has already returned to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity. But many others in the group are not expected to do so until well into 2023. The report says the cumulative losses in income per person over the period 2020 to 2022 are likely to be 20% for those countries, compared with a less severe but still large figure of 11% for the developed world. The report also says that gains in poverty reduction have been reversed. It says people counted as extremely poor are likely to have increased by 95 million last year, with a rise of 80 million in the number who are undernourished. The IMF says the divergences are occurring not just between but also within countries. Income inequality is likely to increase as young people and those with relatively low levels of skills have been harder hit in both developed and developing countries. Women have already been affected as they account for a large share of employment in some sectors, such as tourism, where there is a lot of personal contact. The pandemic has also had an impact on workers whose jobs are vulnerable to automation. That is a process that has been accelerated as a result of the health crisis.

He said while there were tensions across communities there was ""no justification for violence and attacks on police officers and members of public"". ""When our officers have arrived to deal with situations they are met with petrol bombs, debris, wheelie bins and that takes a degree of orchestration - which is evidence this is not spontaneous,"" he added. The senior police officer said he did not want to see young people being criminalised. ""Not only did their reckless and criminal behaviour place the lives of our officers in danger, but such senseless behaviour shows the blatant disregard those responsible have for the safety of others by throwing debris onto a motorway. ""It is extremely fortunate no one was seriously injured, or worse."" This video can not be played The Police Federation say ""sinister elements"" are influencing younger people to attack police The assembly is to be recalled on Thursday morning to discuss the violence. The Alliance party secured the 30 signatures needed for the recall. Last week, the assembly was recalled early asMLAs debated a motion of censure against Sinn FÃ©inpoliticians in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. During the Easter weekend, officers were injured during violence in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Derry. The Police Federation said some of those who were hurt had potentially ""career-impacting"" injuries.

"First doses of a Covid vaccine have been given to 60% of adults in the UK now, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says And 10.4% of adults have had both vaccination jabs - more second doses than first are being given at the moment Boris Johnson urges people to keep getting vaccinated amid debate about a potential link between the AstraZeneca jab and blood clots The Moderna vaccine will be available in the UK ""around the third week of April"", the government says The PM says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap The downward trend in coronavirus cases and deaths in the UK is continuing Secondary schools in Scotland will reopen full time as planned after the Easter holidays Australian and New Zealand residents can travel between the two nations without quarantine from 19 April North Korea has announced it will not take part in the Olympics this year Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for today but the live page will return again tomorrow with more coronavirus updates. Today's live page has been brought to you by Alex Therrien, Alexandra Fouche, Doug Faulkner, George Wright, Holly Wallis and James Clarke. France has opened large vaccination centres We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day. Here's a round-up of the day's biggest developments around the world: We'll be closing up for the day shortly but here is a reminder of what has been happening across the UK today: As we reported earlier a comedy club in Liverpool received a deluge of abuse after it wasinaccurately reported to be involved in a Covid vaccine passport schemeover the weekend. Now the Hot Water Comedy Club says as a result of ""misleading press releases/media articles and the confusing messaging on the official government website"" it has made the decision not to be part of any government programme. ""We have still not managed to speak to anybody in the government about this,"" a statement says. Stuart Jones said he thought people would now be ""much more willing"" to shop on the High Street again We've been hearing a lot over the past few days about how people in the UK are feeling about the route out of lockdown. Stuart Jones says he is âlooking forward to finally
openingâ his personalised garment printing business in Romsey, Hampshire, for
the first time next Monday - 12 April. The 41-year-old took on a lease in September and
was all set to open in November but was stopped by the second lockdown. He then decided against opening the business at
Christmas for many reasons, the main one being what he saw as a âweariness
around the pandemicâ. Back then, Stuart, who is from Romsey himself, thought people would be less likely to shop
on the High Street but now he hopes with more people vaccinated, shoppers will return and support local businesses again. Stuart says: âNow weâre on the road to freedom, Iâve had my
first vaccine and it feels like thereâs light at the end of the tunnel and
people are much more willing to shop on the High Street again. âI know I will be looking to shop on the High Street again and support independent shops with a boost that's desperately needed.""  A man and a woman walk their dog in Vancouver Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has warned of a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeping the country. ""Around the world, countries are facing a very serious third
wave of this pandemic,"" Trudeau tells a news conference. ""And
right now, so is Canada."" Hospitalisations are rising rapidly and intensive care beds are filling up as variants spread, he warns. Canada has averaged almost 5,200 new coronavirus cases per
day over the past week. Ontario - the nation's most
populous province - was put into a limited lockdown over the weekend, but some
local health officials are calling for stronger restrictions. More than 23,000 Canadians have lost their lives to the virus. Discussions about a possible link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots are continuing. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should listen to medical regulators and keep getting their jabs. But some EU countries recently paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns. And as we've told you in the past half hour, a trial of the vaccine on childrenhas been pausedwhile those behind it await more information from UK regulator the MHRA. Regulators are carrying out a review into reports that a very small number of recently-immunised people suffered an extremely rare form of blood clot, called a cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). In the UK, 30 people have developed the clots - and seven have died as a result - out of 18 million people who have received the vaccine. Regulators and experts say the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, and no link has been established. Read morehere. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes Footage of Rwandan newlyweds and family guests forced to spend their wedding night in a stadium for breaching coronavirus rules has sparked criticism. Spending the evening at a stadium ""on my wedding day is a bad memory that will never fade in my life"", one bride has told the BBC anonymously. ""Inflicting pain and shaming people like this doesn't make us fear corona or observe measures."" Police in the capital, Kigali, had stopped at least three weddings over the Easter weekend because they exceeded the maximum of 20 attendees. A police spokesperson told Rwandan media ""more people doing parties are violating the measures"", and police wouldn't allow it to continue. Some people online said police were ""now going too far"" by unlawfully holding people for hours at night in stadiums, while others praised officers for taking action to ""keep them safeâ. Clarisse Karasira, a Rwandan music star, tweeted ""this act lacks humanity"", and said it was ""an eternal pain to the couple and their children"". Rwandaâs response to Covid-19 has been praised internationally, but activists and opposition have deplored deep human rights violations in the process. The country has recorded more than 22,000 cases of Covid-19 and 311 deaths. BBC Radio 5 Live The boss of the relaunched Thomas
Cook holiday brand has told the BBC vaccine passports could be welcomed by the travel industry if it means foreign travel can open up again. The 179-year-old Thomas Cook Groupcollapsedin 2019, but was resurrected as an online-only travel agentlast year. Its chief executive, Alan French, earlier today told BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up to Money: âI think the vaccine passport does look like itâs going to be part of the tool set that allows people to travel. âI can see within the travel business the passport being a player. âAt the moment, the travel industryâs having to react very flexibly. If the vaccination passport can help in any way, that would be helpful for us,â he said. Thomas Cook Group collapsed in 2019 but was relaunched as an online travel agent last year. He has joined other travel industry voices calling on the governmentfor greater clarity. ""For us, the signals are positive, but the details as to how people can travel are missing,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""hopeful"" foreign travel can begin again on 17 May. French says he's âlooking forwardâ to an industry report from the government'sGlobal Travel Taskforce,externaldue to be published next Monday, which is expected to recommend measures designed to facilitate the return of international tourism as quickly as possible. Anna CollinsonHealth Correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial on children and teenagers has been paused while the UK regulator investigates whether there's a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Prof Andrew Pollard from Oxford University has told the BBC while there are no safety concerns with the trial itself, the paediatric clinical trial will not give any further vaccinations while they await for additional information from the MHRA. Participants in the trial are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions. About 300 volunteers signed up for the trial which started in February. Researchers are assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17.
Updates from the European Medicines Agency and the MHRA are expected in the coming days. You can read more here. The number of patients in hospital in England with Covid-19 has dropped to its lowest level for six months, figures show. A total of 2,588 patients were in hospital at 08:00 BST, according to figures from NHS England. This is the lowest since the number was 2,435 on 4 October, and is down 92% from a record 34,336 on 18 January. During the first wave of the virus, patient numbers peaked at 18,974 on 12 April. Hospital admissions in England of patients with Covid-19 are at their lowest level for nearly seven months, with 156 admissions reported on Sunday, 4 April. This is the lowest since 153 on 13 September and is down 96% from the peak on 12 January. The fall in patients and admissions reflects the combined impact of the lockdown and vaccines in helping reduce the number of infections that need hospital treatment. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent All
medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe
side effects. The
seasonal flu jab has about a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve
disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. The
key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits. Even
if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest
about one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK. For
everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid
infections. For
those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000. On
the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination if you assume you are going to be
infected at some point. But what is needed now is more information about who has been
suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any
underlying health conditions that could explain what happened? This
will help narrow down the
scale of any potential risks. An
update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the
coming days. The United States is further ramping up its vaccination programme, which has accelerated since Joe Biden took office in January. The Biden administration says all adults will be eligible for a jab by 19 April - almost two weeks earlier than the previous target. President Biden is expected to speak about the vaccination effort later today. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, tells reporters: ""The president will announce officially later this afternoon that we've reached 150 million shots in arms since entering government and that by 19 April all adult Americans will be eligible to get the vaccine. ""That doesn't mean they will get it that day, it means they can join the line that day if they have not already done that beforehand."" Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The process of unlocking society confronts us with a dilemma that will mould the politics of the coming months: what is, simultaneously, epidemiologically safe and yet ethically, practically and politically possible? Having to prove you're not contagious - because you've been jabbed, tested or have immunity - is the very essence of this debate, because without that, argue some, how can social distancing be abandoned in the summer, while providing reassurance that is safe? The government calls its exploration of this idea ""Covid status certification."" But critics, including about 40 Conservative MPs, think it reeks of a ""papers, please"" society; an ID card in all but name. Ministers acknowledge the idea raises ethical issues. It raises colossal practical ones too: the NHS has been asked to look into what ministers call a ""digital and non-digital route"" to demonstrating your Covid status. An app and a scrap - of paper - in other words. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs said today the idea would ""lead to a two-tier Britain entirely incompatible with freedom"". And Labour are sceptical too. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have expressed a cautious openness to the idea of a domestic Covid certificate.  Northern Ireland's Health Minister says he doesn't support them. Egyptian authorities have launched an investigation after the body of a coronavirus victim was dug up from a grave and then burnt. According to local media, the remains were those of a hospital nurse who had died of the disease in Helwan, south of Cairo. Such is the stigma surrounding the virus in Egypt there have been reports of some communities being very reluctant to allow its victims to be buried in their cemeteries. In April last year,23 people were arrested for blocking the burial of a doctor who reportedly died with coronavirus. The group were believed to have feared a body buried with the virus could spread it. This video can not be played One of the positive impacts of lockdown is that there has been a big reduction in light pollution. A nationwide star count found a 10% drop in the amount of people who could only see 10 or fewer stars, an indicator of severe light pollution. Light pollution can impact human health and wildlife by disturbing biological cycles and behaviours. The BBC's Justin Rowlatt visited the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, an area that benefits from some of the darkest skies in England, to explore the impact of having less light pollution. Three in five UK adults have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab, the health secretary says. Some 31,622,367 have received a first vaccine, with 5,496,716 people now fully vaccinated thanks to a second dose - 10.4% of the adult population. Matt Hancock says it is ""fantastic"" news and has tweeted his thanks to ""everyone involved in the vaccine rollout"", saying ""we're making great strides in our national effort"". More than 37 million jabs have been given in the UK - 31.6 million first doses and just under 5.5 million second The president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, has been vaccinated with the Chinese coronavirus jab, Sinopharm, in an attempt to encourage reluctant Serbians to follow suit. A poor uptake prompted the government last month to invite in foreigners to get inoculated. Several thousand Bosnians took up the offer. A similar number marched through the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Tuesday in protest at their own government's failure to secure enough doses - fewer than 200,000 for a population of 3.5 million. Critics say Serbia's apparent generosity was a sign of its desire to restore its regional dominance, and that the Russian and Chinese vaccines on offer have not been approved for use in Europe. Thousands took to the streets in Sarajevo Meanwhile, in Slovakia fresh doubts have been raised about a controversial stock of Russian vaccine. The drug regulator has reportedly found the unused batch is different from the Sputnik vaccine reviewed by the medical magazine the Lancet. Slovakia PM Igor Matovic resigned last week over the furore caused by his decision to buy the stock without consultation. You can see from these graphs hospitalisations and new Covid cases continue to decline in the UK. You can also see the shift in the government's vaccine rollout to focus on second doses, with more of these now being given than first jabs.

"People can now enter their phone numbers into a website to see if they appeared in a recent Facebook data breach. Details of more than 530 million people were leaked in a database online, largely consisting of mobile numbers.

But the information has now been published for free in a hacking forum, making it widely available. The database covers 533 million people in 106 countries, according to researchers analysing the data. That includes 11 million Facebook users in the UK, 30 million Americans and 7 million Australians. Not every piece of data is available for each user but 500 million phone numbers were leaked compared with âonly a few million email addressesâ, Troy Hunt, a security expert who runs HaveIBeenPwned saidin a blog on his website.,external Mr Hunt launched the phone number search function after âunprecedented trafficâ to the website, following the news of the Facebook data leak.

It is the star's second number one after Old Town Road, the country-rap crossover that spent a record 19 weeks at the top of the US chart in 2019. The video is surreal and absurd, and has provoked strong reactions in the US Montero has caused a stir with its high-concept video, which sees Lil Nas X descending to hell on a stripper pole and lapdancing for the devil - before killing him, stealing his horns and claiming them for himself. The 21-year-old simultaneously released a limited edition range of sneakers, dubbed Satan Shoes, which featured a drop of human blood in the sole. This video can not be played Who bought Lil Nas X $1,000 'Satan shoe'? Both the video and the merchandise were condemned by some commentators.

Lil Nas X's video is teasing and camp - but it also knows the history of moral panic when musicians mix sexuality and religion, from thebackwards messagessupposedly hidden in songs by The Beatles and Judas Priest, to Madonna's Like A Prayer video. But there's a serious side to this too. The rapper says Montero was inspired by a man he met and fell for last summer.

"The collapsed fashion chain Peacocks has been bought out of administration, a move that includes transferring 2,000 jobs and 200 shops. The number means the other half of the 400 trading at the time of the chain's collapse last November will not reopen as Peacocks. It was previously owned by Edinburgh Woollen Mills (EWM). The buyers are an international consortium, led by Peacocks' former chief operating officer, Steve Simpson. He hopes to reopen the stores once non-essential retailers are allowed out of lockdown. EWM Group is a private investment group controlled by the Day family, which is owed money by Peacocks and is supporting the consortium. Peacocks owner on brink putting 21,000 jobs at risk A statement from the administrators, FRP, said the collapse of the chain was due to ""the devastating effects of the Covid-19 lockdown"" on the business. The Peacocks' management team hope that, with the support of their partners, suppliers and landlords, they will be able to reopen up to 200 stores. The statement added the company hoped all 1,850 store staff, who are currently on furlough, will be able to return to work once stores reopen, along with more than 150 in head office and support. A similar deal was set in place with EWM and Bonmarche brands, while another of EWM's brands, Jaeger, was sold to Marks & Spencer, which intends to run it as an online-only business. Peacocks had 400 stores going into the pandemic a year ago and announced a series of job losses and store closures as it struggled to manage under the various restrictions. Analyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Peacocks will be a much leaner beast emerging from the crisis, with its footprint of around 400 stores halved under the deal. ""Shedding the excess weight of underperforming outlets will help it be more nimble but getting the online offering into better shape will be even more crucial, given its rivals are seen as racing ahead."" She added that there were parallels with Sir Philip Green's Arcadia chain, whose star outlet was Top Shop: ""Like Arcadia Group, Peacocks former owner, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, struggled with the accelerated shift to digital brought on by the pandemic.

"This video can not be played Hunter Biden says his father ""saved"" him several times when he was in a dark place with his addiction battle Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, has reflected on his public struggle with drug and alcohol addiction, saying his life ""is not a tabloid"". ""I don't belong to an administration, I belong to a family,"" he told the BBC. He took responsibility for ""creating a story... that anyone conscious would know would be a tabloid sensation"". He also addressed the scrutiny he and his father faced over his work with Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Mr Biden was a director on the board of Burisma while Joe Biden was US vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on US-Ukrainian relations. Speaking to US broadcaster CBS, he also said he was confident that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing over his business affairs by an ongoing US Department of Justice investigation. The business dealings in Ukraine made him a frequent target of Republican criticism during the 2020 election campaign, and were at the centre of former US President Donald Trump's first impeachment. The impeachment inquiry focused on a conversation Mr Trump had with Ukraine's president in which he appeared to pressure him to open an inquiry into the Bidens. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. Biden and Ukraine: What we know about corruption claims Hang on, why was Trump impeached again? While defending his qualifications for the position at Burisma, Mr Biden said that, in retrospect, he had ""missed... the perception that I would create"". ""I know that it is hard to believe with 20/20 hindsight how I could possibly have missed that,"" the 51-year-old told the BBC in an interview. He added that Burisma saw his name ""as gold"" and that it played a large part in his appointment to the board. While no criminal activity by the Bidens has been proven, a senior US state department official raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest as far back as 2015. An investigation by US Republican lawmakers last yearfound that Hunter Biden's work for the Ukrainian firm was ""problematic""but concluded there was not evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. The report also claimed that Biden relatives ""cashed in on Joe Biden's vice presidency"". The report was slammed by Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, one of Mr Trump's most vocal critics in Congress, who described it as a ""political exercise"". Mr Biden acknowledged that his father's name had ""opened doors that wouldn't be opened up to other people"". But he said this had been ""both a privilege and a burden"". Asked by CBS about the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into his financial dealings,external, the president's son said: ""I can say this, I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing."" US media quote sources saying the investigation relates to business dealings with foreign countries including China. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Joe Biden and a life in politics Speaking to the BBC ahead of the release of his new memoir Beautiful Things, Mr Biden said he wanted to write about ""the love of a family and how it saved me"". ""And, you know, we're going through two pandemics right now... there's the pandemic of coronavirus, and there's a pandemic of addiction too,"" he said. Mr Biden's mother and sister died in a car accident in 1972 that he and his brother survived. In the interview, he talked about the links between the trauma he has suffered and his drug and alcohol addiction. ""There's something at the centre of each addict that's missing, that they feel that they need to fill... Nothing can possibly fill it. And so you numb yourself,"" he said. After his brother Beau died of cancer in 2015,he said he ""descended into a really dark, dark place"". ""My brother had just died, I'd separated with my wife, I was in an apartment by myself, and I was basically drinking myself to death. It was awful. I mean, grief does funny things. And combine that with addiction and it is a really hard thing to overcome,"" he said. Hunter Biden acknowledged that his father's name had ""opened doors"" He added that while his struggle with addiction made him a target for tabloid stories and political attacks, it was also something that people across the country could relate to. ""I think what people see in the Biden family is their family. I think that they see all of the tragedy in loss, but they see all the love and sincerity. And I think that they see that we're not much different than any other family out there,"" he said. In anticipation of Mr Trump raising his addiction in the first election debate, Mr Biden said both he and his father ""intuitively knew what to say"". ""I said 'Dad, you know, this is our story. And it's a story of love. It's a story of hope. It's a story that so many people are going through right now. Just talk to them and know that your honesty and my honesty about where we are is what I think will resonate with the American people.' ""It wasn't a political calculation, it was from the heart."" Looking towards his future, Mr Biden said addiction ""never leaves"" but that many addicts had ""gone on to do incredibly brilliant, great, amazing things"". ""It's about time we started looking at addiction as a mental health issue, rather than an ethical or moral issue,"" he said. Asked about the possibility of his father running for re-election at the age of 82, he said: ""My dad is younger than me in his physical and mental capacity... I don't know anyone that has more energy."" What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?

"This video can not be played PM: some lockdown restrictions to be eased from 12 April Pubs and restaurants serving outside can reopen as planned next Monday, along with non-essential shops, gyms and hairdressers, as England's lockdown is further eased, the PM has said. But Boris Johnson urged caution, saying: ""We can't be complacent."" Officials were examining the potential role of Covid status certificates, he told a Downing Street briefing. Pilot eventswill take place from mid-April to trial the system, with later events checking vaccinations. Speaking in Downing Street, the prime minister also said the government was ""hopeful"" international travel could resume in the next stage of lockdown easing on 17 May, but cautioned against the effects of the surge of coronavirus in other parts of the world. He said the government would set out ""well before 17 May what is reasonable"" and aim to give the aviation industry ""as much notice as possible"". What can I do from 12 April? What is the new traffic light system for holidays? What's happening with pools, haircuts and pubs? Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland It comes as the government has publishedan update on a series of reviews,externalinto Covid certificates, the safe return of mass events, international travel and social distancing rules. In the document, the government says it cannot yet confirm international travel can resume on 17 May ""given the state of the pandemic abroad"", and advises people not to book summer holidays abroad ""until the picture is clearer"". It also confirms further details on a risk-based ""traffic light"" system for foreign travel will be published in a report later this week. On Covid status certification, the paper says this could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally and ""is likely to become a feature of our lives"" while the pandemic continues. A certification scheme could record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity. The NHS is working on digital and non-digital ways for individuals to demonstrate their Covid status, according to the government paper, but there were no details on whether this might include using an app. More than 40 Conservative MPs havesigned a cross-party letteropposing the use of vaccine passports for access to jobs or services, with critics calling such a move ""discriminatory"". The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said vaccine passports had managed to ""achieve the remarkable political feat of uniting a former Labour leader and a former Conservative leader against them"", as he asked the prime minister if there would be a vote in Parliament on their introduction. Mr Johnson said the question of a Commons vote was ""taking too many fences at once"", and that the government needs to work out its proposal. He stressed that certification would not be introduced either for the 12 April lockdown easing or for the planned further changes from 17 May that would see pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors. But he said ""all countries"" were looking at vaccination status for international travel, adding: ""I do think that's going to be part of the way people deal with it and we need to think about that."" The government's review said that public transport and essential shops and services would never require Covid status certification, but it could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs, and events such as festivals or sports fixtures. It is also possible that requiring customers to prove their status could ""play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings"" such as pubs and restaurants, the document states. The government said this would be considered in consultation with the industry, and that businesses should continue to plan to reopen in line with the latest guidance. Labour has backed the move to proceed as planned on 12 April, but shadow health minister Justin Madders told the BBC the party had concerns about how vaccine passports could affect ""liberties and freedoms"". Meanwhile, Tory former chief whip Mark Harper, leader of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptics, has called for Parliament to be given a vote on vaccine passports, warning they would lead to a ""two-tier Britain"". And the Confederation of British Industry said firms would need help to navigate ""ethical, legal and practical implementation challenges"" around status certificates. This video can not be played The prime minister said international from 17 May was ""hopeful"" The further easing of lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly could be. Hospital admissions and deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates - that some warned would start rising quickly with the reopening of schools - have continued to drop. With the vaccination programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared to most. What's more, the steps being taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. It's the return of indoor mixing in May that is more of a worry - and then how to allow foreign travel and big events like live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still ""highly likely"" in the future. That's because the vaccine does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come forward for a jab. There's good reason to believe this resurgence will be limited - perhaps no worse than a bad flu season - but it's the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the concern. Speaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson said the decision to proceed with the rule changes was ""fully justified by the data"". He said the government could see nothing in the present data to make it deviate from its roadmap, with ""things still seem set fair"" for the next step along on 17 May. But he added: ""We can't be complacent, we can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries."" Hospitality venues can serve food and alcohol to customers sitting outdoors, with no curfew Spas can reopen, as can zoos, theme parks, drive-in cinemas and drive-in performances events Members of the same household can take a holiday in England in self-contained accommodation Public buildings such as libraries and community centres will also reopen Close-contact services such as beauty and nail salons can reopen Weddings attended by up to 15 people can take place The number of care home visitors will also increase to two per resident Mr Johnson encouraged people to use free NHS tests, as everyone in England is to be given access totwo rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Meanwhile, Prof Whitty warned ""this virus will be with us for the foreseeable future"", and Sir Patrick suggested the pandemic could result in long-term changes in behaviour. Separately, the government's scientific advisers have said the next phase of unlocking is ""highly unlikely"" to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. However, later steps such as indoor mixing are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - has predicted. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Travel industry leaders expressed frustrationat the lack of ""clarity"" in the latest update on foreign travel. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"", adding: ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement."" Meanwhile, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee said the update ""continues to suggest significant barriers to international travel and may push back the date of restart beyond 17 May"", while Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK said it ""does not provide the clarity we were seeking"".

Today's live page has been brought to you by Alex Therrien, Alexandra Fouche, Doug Faulkner, George Wright, Holly Wallis and James Clarke. France has opened large vaccination centres We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day. Here's a round-up of the day's biggest developments around the world: We'll be closing up for the day shortly but here is a reminder of what has been happening across the UK today: As we reported earlier a comedy club in Liverpool received a deluge of abuse after it wasinaccurately reported to be involved in a Covid vaccine passport schemeover the weekend. Now the Hot Water Comedy Club says as a result of ""misleading press releases/media articles and the confusing messaging on the official government website"" it has made the decision not to be part of any government programme. ""We have still not managed to speak to anybody in the government about this,"" a statement says. Stuart Jones said he thought people would now be ""much more willing"" to shop on the High Street again We've been hearing a lot over the past few days about how people in the UK are feeling about the route out of lockdown. Stuart Jones says he is âlooking forward to finally
openingâ his personalised garment printing business in Romsey, Hampshire, for
the first time next Monday - 12 April. The 41-year-old took on a lease in September and
was all set to open in November but was stopped by the second lockdown. He then decided against opening the business at
Christmas for many reasons, the main one being what he saw as a âweariness
around the pandemicâ. Back then, Stuart, who is from Romsey himself, thought people would be less likely to shop
on the High Street but now he hopes with more people vaccinated, shoppers will return and support local businesses again. Stuart says: âNow weâre on the road to freedom, Iâve had my
first vaccine and it feels like thereâs light at the end of the tunnel and
people are much more willing to shop on the High Street again. âI know I will be looking to shop on the High Street again and support independent shops with a boost that's desperately needed.""  A man and a woman walk their dog in Vancouver Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has warned of a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeping the country. ""Around the world, countries are facing a very serious third
wave of this pandemic,"" Trudeau tells a news conference. ""And
right now, so is Canada."" Hospitalisations are rising rapidly and intensive care beds are filling up as variants spread, he warns. Canada has averaged almost 5,200 new coronavirus cases per
day over the past week. Ontario - the nation's most
populous province - was put into a limited lockdown over the weekend, but some
local health officials are calling for stronger restrictions. More than 23,000 Canadians have lost their lives to the virus. Discussions about a possible link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots are continuing. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should listen to medical regulators and keep getting their jabs. But some EU countries recently paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns. And as we've told you in the past half hour, a trial of the vaccine on childrenhas been pausedwhile those behind it await more information from UK regulator the MHRA. Regulators are carrying out a review into reports that a very small number of recently-immunised people suffered an extremely rare form of blood clot, called a cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). In the UK, 30 people have developed the clots - and seven have died as a result - out of 18 million people who have received the vaccine. Regulators and experts say the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, and no link has been established. Read morehere. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes Footage of Rwandan newlyweds and family guests forced to spend their wedding night in a stadium for breaching coronavirus rules has sparked criticism. Spending the evening at a stadium ""on my wedding day is a bad memory that will never fade in my life"", one bride has told the BBC anonymously. ""Inflicting pain and shaming people like this doesn't make us fear corona or observe measures."" Police in the capital, Kigali, had stopped at least three weddings over the Easter weekend because they exceeded the maximum of 20 attendees. A police spokesperson told Rwandan media ""more people doing parties are violating the measures"", and police wouldn't allow it to continue. Some people online said police were ""now going too far"" by unlawfully holding people for hours at night in stadiums, while others praised officers for taking action to ""keep them safeâ. Clarisse Karasira, a Rwandan music star, tweeted ""this act lacks humanity"", and said it was ""an eternal pain to the couple and their children"". Rwandaâs response to Covid-19 has been praised internationally, but activists and opposition have deplored deep human rights violations in the process. The country has recorded more than 22,000 cases of Covid-19 and 311 deaths. BBC Radio 5 Live The boss of the relaunched Thomas
Cook holiday brand has told the BBC vaccine passports could be welcomed by the travel industry if it means foreign travel can open up again. The 179-year-old Thomas Cook Groupcollapsedin 2019, but was resurrected as an online-only travel agentlast year. Its chief executive, Alan French, earlier today told BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up to Money: âI think the vaccine passport does look like itâs going to be part of the tool set that allows people to travel. âI can see within the travel business the passport being a player. âAt the moment, the travel industryâs having to react very flexibly. If the vaccination passport can help in any way, that would be helpful for us,â he said. Thomas Cook Group collapsed in 2019 but was relaunched as an online travel agent last year. He has joined other travel industry voices calling on the governmentfor greater clarity. ""For us, the signals are positive, but the details as to how people can travel are missing,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""hopeful"" foreign travel can begin again on 17 May. French says he's âlooking forwardâ to an industry report from the government'sGlobal Travel Taskforce,externaldue to be published next Monday, which is expected to recommend measures designed to facilitate the return of international tourism as quickly as possible. Anna CollinsonHealth Correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial on children and teenagers has been paused while the UK regulator investigates whether there's a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Prof Andrew Pollard from Oxford University has told the BBC while there are no safety concerns with the trial itself, the paediatric clinical trial will not give any further vaccinations while they await for additional information from the MHRA. Participants in the trial are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions. About 300 volunteers signed up for the trial which started in February. Researchers are assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17.
Updates from the European Medicines Agency and the MHRA are expected in the coming days. You can read more here. The number of patients in hospital in England with Covid-19 has dropped to its lowest level for six months, figures show. A total of 2,588 patients were in hospital at 08:00 BST, according to figures from NHS England. This is the lowest since the number was 2,435 on 4 October, and is down 92% from a record 34,336 on 18 January. During the first wave of the virus, patient numbers peaked at 18,974 on 12 April. Hospital admissions in England of patients with Covid-19 are at their lowest level for nearly seven months, with 156 admissions reported on Sunday, 4 April. This is the lowest since 153 on 13 September and is down 96% from the peak on 12 January. The fall in patients and admissions reflects the combined impact of the lockdown and vaccines in helping reduce the number of infections that need hospital treatment. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent All
medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe
side effects. The
seasonal flu jab has about a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve
disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. The
key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits. Even
if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest
about one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK. For
everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid
infections. For
those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000. On
the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination if you assume you are going to be
infected at some point. But what is needed now is more information about who has been
suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any
underlying health conditions that could explain what happened? This
will help narrow down the
scale of any potential risks. An
update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the
coming days. The United States is further ramping up its vaccination programme, which has accelerated since Joe Biden took office in January. The Biden administration says all adults will be eligible for a jab by 19 April - almost two weeks earlier than the previous target. President Biden is expected to speak about the vaccination effort later today. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, tells reporters: ""The president will announce officially later this afternoon that we've reached 150 million shots in arms since entering government and that by 19 April all adult Americans will be eligible to get the vaccine. ""That doesn't mean they will get it that day, it means they can join the line that day if they have not already done that beforehand."" Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The process of unlocking society confronts us with a dilemma that will mould the politics of the coming months: what is, simultaneously, epidemiologically safe and yet ethically, practically and politically possible? Having to prove you're not contagious - because you've been jabbed, tested or have immunity - is the very essence of this debate, because without that, argue some, how can social distancing be abandoned in the summer, while providing reassurance that is safe? The government calls its exploration of this idea ""Covid status certification."" But critics, including about 40 Conservative MPs, think it reeks of a ""papers, please"" society; an ID card in all but name. Ministers acknowledge the idea raises ethical issues. It raises colossal practical ones too: the NHS has been asked to look into what ministers call a ""digital and non-digital route"" to demonstrating your Covid status. An app and a scrap - of paper - in other words. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs said today the idea would ""lead to a two-tier Britain entirely incompatible with freedom"". And Labour are sceptical too. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have expressed a cautious openness to the idea of a domestic Covid certificate.  Northern Ireland's Health Minister says he doesn't support them. Egyptian authorities have launched an investigation after the body of a coronavirus victim was dug up from a grave and then burnt. According to local media, the remains were those of a hospital nurse who had died of the disease in Helwan, south of Cairo. Such is the stigma surrounding the virus in Egypt there have been reports of some communities being very reluctant to allow its victims to be buried in their cemeteries. In April last year,23 people were arrested for blocking the burial of a doctor who reportedly died with coronavirus. The group were believed to have feared a body buried with the virus could spread it. This video can not be played One of the positive impacts of lockdown is that there has been a big reduction in light pollution. A nationwide star count found a 10% drop in the amount of people who could only see 10 or fewer stars, an indicator of severe light pollution. Light pollution can impact human health and wildlife by disturbing biological cycles and behaviours. The BBC's Justin Rowlatt visited the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, an area that benefits from some of the darkest skies in England, to explore the impact of having less light pollution. Three in five UK adults have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab, the health secretary says. Some 31,622,367 have received a first vaccine, with 5,496,716 people now fully vaccinated thanks to a second dose - 10.4% of the adult population. Matt Hancock says it is ""fantastic"" news and has tweeted his thanks to ""everyone involved in the vaccine rollout"", saying ""we're making great strides in our national effort"". More than 37 million jabs have been given in the UK - 31.6 million first doses and just under 5.5 million second The president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, has been vaccinated with the Chinese coronavirus jab, Sinopharm, in an attempt to encourage reluctant Serbians to follow suit. A poor uptake prompted the government last month to invite in foreigners to get inoculated. Several thousand Bosnians took up the offer. A similar number marched through the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Tuesday in protest at their own government's failure to secure enough doses - fewer than 200,000 for a population of 3.5 million. Critics say Serbia's apparent generosity was a sign of its desire to restore its regional dominance, and that the Russian and Chinese vaccines on offer have not been approved for use in Europe. Thousands took to the streets in Sarajevo Meanwhile, in Slovakia fresh doubts have been raised about a controversial stock of Russian vaccine. The drug regulator has reportedly found the unused batch is different from the Sputnik vaccine reviewed by the medical magazine the Lancet. Slovakia PM Igor Matovic resigned last week over the furore caused by his decision to buy the stock without consultation. You can see from these graphs hospitalisations and new Covid cases continue to decline in the UK. You can also see the shift in the government's vaccine rollout to focus on second doses, with more of these now being given than first jabs.

"Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans. The prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a ""fact of life"" for people travelling internationally in future. The government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. However, the prime minister said he had ""not given up"" on the idea. Under plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. No isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to Â£200 each. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren But earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases. Asked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can. ""The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible."" Mr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government ""wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it. ""If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destinationâ¦ [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities."" 'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Scientists and ministers recently warnedthat holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are ""unlikely"". But Mr Johnson said he ""had not given up"" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly However,other travel industry figures called for clarityfollowing the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing. The Business Travel Association said the announcement was ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". Its chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had ""once again been kicked down the road"". ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,"" he added. The boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down. He said that overall, there were ""glimmers of good news"", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. ""But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April. But Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path. ""Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidaysâ¦ that just won't come this week."" She added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions. ""Every week we don't have that confidence from consumers, business owners like myself just wonder what lies ahead.""

"There is speculation the NHS app could be amended to include a Covid vaccine certificate As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play. And despiteprevious denialsthat a ""Covid passport"" app was being considered, it is now on the agenda. After all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision. But earlier this weekThe Times reported,externalthat the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England. It is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it. But according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start. Officially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject. But it's clear there would be several benefits. Firstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records. In fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information. (Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself). So health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information. There is a risk countries develop Covid passports that rely on local systems that do not intercommunicate Secondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved. To set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence. The smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification. And then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access. However, there are still issues to be addressed. People would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen. And then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily. Another health pass app points the way to how that might be done. Tested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff. Of course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it. Tested.me presents a QR barcode over a view of the user's face to provide a quick way for employers to verify and log their health status And there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue. That presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated. And one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on. So the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others. A further consideration is that these ""passports"" would probably not be used for travel abroad. The World Health Organization is exploringwhat specifications an international scheme,externalwould require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. It already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate. And the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app. The face-scanning tech used by the NHS app is supplied by iProov One last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. These would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data. Identity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this. Its chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? But whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter. In any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. And that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality.

"Credit Suisse's chief risk officer Lara Warner has left the bank Credit Suisse took drastic action on Tuesday, replacing two key executives and cutting bonuses amid the fallout from two major business relationships. Its chief risk officer, Lara Warner and its investment banking chief, Brian Chin will both leave the bank in April. Two businesses linked to the Swiss banking giant, Greensill Capital and hedge fund Archegos imploded in recent weeks with major losses. Greensill was the key financial backer of Liberty Steel owner, GFG Alliance. Greensill Capital, filed for insolvency earlier this month. There are concerns about the future of Liberty Steel which directly employs 3,000 people in the UK. An additional 2,000 people work for GFG Alliance in the UK. Credit Suisse said it expects to make a $960m (Â£690m) loss for the first quarter. It had planned to ask shareholders to vote on both short and long-term bonus awards for executives, but it has now cancelled these proposals and it is cutting its proposed dividend payout to shareholders. It also warned of a $4.7bn loss from Archegos' implosion alone. It said it had yet to calculate the cost of its involvement with Greensill Capital. Archegos is run by controversial former hedge fund manager, Bill Hwang.The Swiss bank was one of several lenders that acted as prime broker to Mr Hwang. David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Credit Suisse and Nomura warn of hedge fund hit Archegos collapsed after bets it made on stocks unravelled. Shares in one of its holdings, US entertainment giant Viacom, starting falling, forcing it to sell them off in double-quick time. Credit Suisse was one of the last to try to unload its shares in the company, selling then at just over $40 per share, compared with the $100 it was priced at earlier in March. Credit Suisse's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, said in a statement: ""The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable. ""In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognise that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders.""Â Credit Suisse said it had launched investigations into both of these matters. It said these would not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also on the broader consequences. Mr Gottstein said: ""Serious lessons will be learned."" The bank's results will be published on April 22, 2021.

"Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans. The prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a ""fact of life"" for people travelling internationally in future. The government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. However, the prime minister said he had ""not given up"" on the idea. Under plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. No isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to Â£200 each. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren But earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases. Asked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can. ""The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible."" Mr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government ""wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it. ""If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destinationâ¦ [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities."" 'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Scientists and ministers recently warnedthat holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are ""unlikely"". But Mr Johnson said he ""had not given up"" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly However,other travel industry figures called for clarityfollowing the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing. The Business Travel Association said the announcement was ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". Its chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had ""once again been kicked down the road"". ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,"" he added. The boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down. He said that overall, there were ""glimmers of good news"", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. ""But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April. But Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path. ""Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidaysâ¦ that just won't come this week."" She added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions.

"Mental health ""hubs"" for new, expectant or bereaved mothers are to be set up around England. The 26 sites, due to be opened by next April, will offer physical health checks and psychological therapy in one building. NHS England said these centres would provide treatment for about 6,000 new parents in the first year. Five years ago, 40% of areas in England had no dedicated maternal mental health services. Things have improved since then with some specialist services available in each of the 44 local NHS areas in England. But in the NHS's Long Term Plan, published in 2019, the health service pledged to offer more ""evidence-based"" support, including to partners and families through these hubs or ""outreach clinics"". The NHS hopes to offer services to people with moderate-to-severe difficulties, whereas earlier investment focused on the most acutely unwell mothers. Are new mums getting the help they need? These clinics will ""integrate maternity, reproductive health and psychological therapy for women experiencing mental health difficulties directly arising from, or related to, the maternity experience,"" NHS England said. 'It's our job to keep mothers and babies safe' New mums ask hospitals for more pregnancy support One of the new sites, in Devon, opened in January this year. Lizzie, who experienced low mood and nightmares during her pregnancy having previously suffered a miscarriage, was referred to the service for some support. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offered a therapy called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), which is designed to help people cope with distressing memories. After the treatment and having had her baby girl Enfys, Lizzie said: ""I feel unbelievably better after this pregnancy and birth compared to how I felt after my experience with my first child, when there wasn't any support available to me; even with the added distress of having a miscarriage, the pressures of Covid-19 restrictions and not being able to see my family. ""I feel happier, more confident and much better in my mental health. I feel fully recovered."" In 2019-20, more than 30,000 women were seen by specialist perinatal mental health community services. NHS England has made a commitment to offer specialist care to at least 66,000 people with mental health difficulties related to pregnancy, birth or parenthood by 2023-24. Emily Slater, CEO of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said: ""For the more than one in 10 expectant and new mothers experiencing mental health problems, and the increased numbers as a result of the pandemic, there needs to be a system of care available to support them. ""These new services will enable more women than ever to access vital perinatal mental health care."" Help will be available from before conception - for those with pre-existing mental health conditions who want to get pregnant - until the baby's second birthday, whereas currently these services are available for the first year of a child's life. NHS England said care would be provided for a ""wide range of mental health issues from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after giving birth to others with a severe fear of childbirth,"" for 1,001 days from conception. Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said: ""Every woman has a unique experience with pregnancy and motherhood and some will need extra support to cope with mental health issues that can range from anxiety to severe depression. ""I would encourage any mum who needs this support to come forward safe in the knowledge that her mental health and wellbeing are of paramount importance and she should not feel ashamed of accessing the help she needs."" The clinics will also train maternity staff and midwives as well as providing psychological therapies to people during pregnancy and after giving birth. The first 10 sites will open around England ""within months"", in: Birmingham & Solihull Leicestershire Northamptonshire Shropshire Telford & Wrekin South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw Lancashire and South Cumbria Hampshire and Isle of Wight Kent and Medway Cornwall Devon The rest are expected to be up and running by April 2022, with plans for all 44 local NHS areas to have one of these hubs by April 2024.

"The collapsed fashion chain Peacocks has been bought out of administration, a move that includes transferring 2,000 jobs and 200 shops. The number means the other half of the 400 trading at the time of the chain's collapse last November will not reopen as Peacocks. It was previously owned by Edinburgh Woollen Mills (EWM). The buyers are an international consortium, led by Peacocks' former chief operating officer, Steve Simpson. He hopes to reopen the stores once non-essential retailers are allowed out of lockdown. EWM Group is a private investment group controlled by the Day family, which is owed money by Peacocks and is supporting the consortium. Peacocks owner on brink putting 21,000 jobs at risk A statement from the administrators, FRP, said the collapse of the chain was due to ""the devastating effects of the Covid-19 lockdown"" on the business. The Peacocks' management team hope that, with the support of their partners, suppliers and landlords, they will be able to reopen up to 200 stores. The statement added the company hoped all 1,850 store staff, who are currently on furlough, will be able to return to work once stores reopen, along with more than 150 in head office and support. A similar deal was set in place with EWM and Bonmarche brands, while another of EWM's brands, Jaeger, was sold to Marks & Spencer, which intends to run it as an online-only business. Peacocks had 400 stores going into the pandemic a year ago and announced a series of job losses and store closures as it struggled to manage under the various restrictions. Analyst Susannah Streeter at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Peacocks will be a much leaner beast emerging from the crisis, with its footprint of around 400 stores halved under the deal. ""Shedding the excess weight of underperforming outlets will help it be more nimble but getting the online offering into better shape will be even more crucial, given its rivals are seen as racing ahead."" She added that there were parallels with Sir Philip Green's Arcadia chain, whose star outlet was Top Shop: ""Like Arcadia Group, Peacocks former owner, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, struggled with the accelerated shift to digital brought on by the pandemic. It was another sprawling retail empire which collapsed, with former rivals picking over the spoils.""

"Credit Suisse's chief risk officer Lara Warner has left the bank Credit Suisse took drastic action on Tuesday, replacing two key executives and cutting bonuses amid the fallout from two major business relationships. Its chief risk officer, Lara Warner and its investment banking chief, Brian Chin will both leave the bank in April. Two businesses linked to the Swiss banking giant, Greensill Capital and hedge fund Archegos imploded in recent weeks with major losses. Greensill was the key financial backer of Liberty Steel owner, GFG Alliance. Greensill Capital, filed for insolvency earlier this month. There are concerns about the future of Liberty Steel which directly employs 3,000 people in the UK. An additional 2,000 people work for GFG Alliance in the UK. Credit Suisse said it expects to make a $960m (Â£690m) loss for the first quarter. It had planned to ask shareholders to vote on both short and long-term bonus awards for executives, but it has now cancelled these proposals and it is cutting its proposed dividend payout to shareholders. It also warned of a $4.7bn loss from Archegos' implosion alone. It said it had yet to calculate the cost of its involvement with Greensill Capital. Archegos is run by controversial former hedge fund manager, Bill Hwang.The Swiss bank was one of several lenders that acted as prime broker to Mr Hwang. David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Credit Suisse and Nomura warn of hedge fund hit Archegos collapsed after bets it made on stocks unravelled. Shares in one of its holdings, US entertainment giant Viacom, starting falling, forcing it to sell them off in double-quick time. Credit Suisse was one of the last to try to unload its shares in the company, selling then at just over $40 per share, compared with the $100 it was priced at earlier in March. Credit Suisse's chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, said in a statement: ""The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable. ""In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognise that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders.""Â Credit Suisse said it had launched investigations into both of these matters. It said these would not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also on the broader consequences. Mr Gottstein said: ""Serious lessons will be learned."" The bank's results will be published on April 22, 2021.

"Pub landlord Paul Slater says he is frustrated at the lack of information from the Welsh Government ""The English seem to have some vision and we don't seem to have a road map out of it."" Pub landlord Paul Slater said he is frustrated at the lack of information from the Welsh Government about when businesses might be able to reopen. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) wants more details about the conditions for lifting lockdown. The Welsh Government said new variants of coronavirus mean it cannot provide as much certainty as they would like. Ministers also argued the package of business support is the most generous in the UK. Tories demand Welsh Covid roadmap after PM's plan Town centres focus of green post-Covid recovery The head of the FSB in Wales, Ben Cottam, said there is a danger tourism firms will lose a significant amount of Easter trade. Ben Cottam, head of Wales for FSB, calls for security on funding for businesses On Monday, the UK governmentset out its roadmap for the reopening of businesses in England. Mr Cottam said it was ""welcome"" that the Welsh Government gave some indication to retail and close contact businesses as to their path out of lockdown on Friday. But he said there should be ""a clearer conversation now"" about what businesses will need to do ahead of reopening. Mr Cottam argued this did not happen as the country came out of similar lockdown measures last year. ""It's been really frustrating for businesses that the day they're able to reopen, they get the guidance."" Paul Slater says his staff want ""to know what's going on"" Paul Slater is the landlord of The Trotting Mare pub which sits the Welsh side of the border with England, between Whitchurch and Oswestry, in Shropshire. Mr Slater toldBBC Radio Waleshe had been closed for eight of the past 12 months, and called for more information from the Welsh Government. ""It's the uncertainty - I have got staff wanting to know what's going on,"" said Mr Slater. ""Even if it was a long term date, we would have something to work towards. ""Wales and England have both got the same data and evidence but Wales are taking a different route, which after three lockdowns is becoming a bit frustrating, whereas the English see to have some vision and we don't seem to have a road map out of it."" Sue Muddeman has owned the Bay Bistro in Rhossili for 16 years Sue Muddeman, who has owned the Bay Bistro in Rhossili for 16 years, said they closed just before Christmas and decided not to reopen to provide a takeaway service. Ms Muddeman doesn't expect a reopening date but called for as much notice as possible in order to prepare. ""There's lots of things that they could be telling us now so that we could be prepared, so when they do have a date for opening we can literally open those doors and we're ready to go,"" she said. ""We probably can't solve the problem of people coming from England that have different rules. That was an issue. But it needs to be laid out very clearly."" Swansea shop Hiatus director Matt Bryer said he will ""persist to make this work"" Meanwhile in Swansea, Hiatus, a sustainability conscious surf, outdoors and lifestyle store, had to delay it's opening due to the pandemic. The company's director, Matt Bryer, explained they finally managed to open the shop in September 2020, but said the past few months have been ""challenging."" ""You've never had to be as dynamic as you have now,"" he said. Mr Bryer said it feels like ""neglect"" when he sees other sectors ""getting access to more funding"". ""It seems like we might be misunderstood on how we operate, how our cashflow operates and how our commitments operates,"" he said. The past few months have been ""challenging"", Hiatus shop director Matt Bryer says Mr Cottam also called on the Welsh Government to offer security on funding for businesses with relief for certain sectors to be extended by a year. ""We would like to see Welsh Government commit to 100% rates relief holiday,"" he said. ""That will just give businesses a little bit of breathing space they need to get back up and running and to help restart the economy."" The FSB wants the Welsh and UK governments to provide consistent messages and trading conditions. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it will move to the alert level three in ""gradual steps, assessing the impact as we go along"". It said a first step, in the next three weeks, would be to consider the rules around non-essential retail and close contact services, and the possibility of re-opening self-contained accommodation for Easter. ""We recognise everyone wants certainty and to be able to plan for the future, and that businesses want to be open and trading - we want that to happen as soon as it is safe to do so,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are actively reviewing our options for providing further support for firms aligned to the review process and have active planning in place to extend if required."" It added that the Welsh Government has provided Â£650m to help businesses through the December to March period in addition to a Â£180m support fund for the tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors.

Today's live page has been brought to you by Alex Therrien, Alexandra Fouche, Doug Faulkner, George Wright, Holly Wallis and James Clarke. France has opened large vaccination centres We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day. Here's a round-up of the day's biggest developments around the world: We'll be closing up for the day shortly but here is a reminder of what has been happening across the UK today: As we reported earlier a comedy club in Liverpool received a deluge of abuse after it wasinaccurately reported to be involved in a Covid vaccine passport schemeover the weekend. Now the Hot Water Comedy Club says as a result of ""misleading press releases/media articles and the confusing messaging on the official government website"" it has made the decision not to be part of any government programme. ""We have still not managed to speak to anybody in the government about this,"" a statement says. Stuart Jones said he thought people would now be ""much more willing"" to shop on the High Street again We've been hearing a lot over the past few days about how people in the UK are feeling about the route out of lockdown. Stuart Jones says he is âlooking forward to finally
openingâ his personalised garment printing business in Romsey, Hampshire, for
the first time next Monday - 12 April. The 41-year-old took on a lease in September and
was all set to open in November but was stopped by the second lockdown. He then decided against opening the business at
Christmas for many reasons, the main one being what he saw as a âweariness
around the pandemicâ. Back then, Stuart, who is from Romsey himself, thought people would be less likely to shop
on the High Street but now he hopes with more people vaccinated, shoppers will return and support local businesses again. Stuart says: âNow weâre on the road to freedom, Iâve had my
first vaccine and it feels like thereâs light at the end of the tunnel and
people are much more willing to shop on the High Street again. âI know I will be looking to shop on the High Street again and support independent shops with a boost that's desperately needed.""  A man and a woman walk their dog in Vancouver Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has warned of a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeping the country. ""Around the world, countries are facing a very serious third
wave of this pandemic,"" Trudeau tells a news conference. ""And
right now, so is Canada."" Hospitalisations are rising rapidly and intensive care beds are filling up as variants spread, he warns. Canada has averaged almost 5,200 new coronavirus cases per
day over the past week. Ontario - the nation's most
populous province - was put into a limited lockdown over the weekend, but some
local health officials are calling for stronger restrictions. More than 23,000 Canadians have lost their lives to the virus. Discussions about a possible link between the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots are continuing. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should listen to medical regulators and keep getting their jabs. But some EU countries recently paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns. And as we've told you in the past half hour, a trial of the vaccine on childrenhas been pausedwhile those behind it await more information from UK regulator the MHRA. Regulators are carrying out a review into reports that a very small number of recently-immunised people suffered an extremely rare form of blood clot, called a cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT). In the UK, 30 people have developed the clots - and seven have died as a result - out of 18 million people who have received the vaccine. Regulators and experts say the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks, and no link has been established. Read morehere. Samba CyuzuzoBBC Great Lakes Footage of Rwandan newlyweds and family guests forced to spend their wedding night in a stadium for breaching coronavirus rules has sparked criticism. Spending the evening at a stadium ""on my wedding day is a bad memory that will never fade in my life"", one bride has told the BBC anonymously. ""Inflicting pain and shaming people like this doesn't make us fear corona or observe measures."" Police in the capital, Kigali, had stopped at least three weddings over the Easter weekend because they exceeded the maximum of 20 attendees. A police spokesperson told Rwandan media ""more people doing parties are violating the measures"", and police wouldn't allow it to continue. Some people online said police were ""now going too far"" by unlawfully holding people for hours at night in stadiums, while others praised officers for taking action to ""keep them safeâ. Clarisse Karasira, a Rwandan music star, tweeted ""this act lacks humanity"", and said it was ""an eternal pain to the couple and their children"". Rwandaâs response to Covid-19 has been praised internationally, but activists and opposition have deplored deep human rights violations in the process. The country has recorded more than 22,000 cases of Covid-19 and 311 deaths. BBC Radio 5 Live The boss of the relaunched Thomas
Cook holiday brand has told the BBC vaccine passports could be welcomed by the travel industry if it means foreign travel can open up again. The 179-year-old Thomas Cook Groupcollapsedin 2019, but was resurrected as an online-only travel agentlast year. Its chief executive, Alan French, earlier today told BBC Radio 5 LiveâsWake Up to Money: âI think the vaccine passport does look like itâs going to be part of the tool set that allows people to travel. âI can see within the travel business the passport being a player. âAt the moment, the travel industryâs having to react very flexibly. If the vaccination passport can help in any way, that would be helpful for us,â he said. Thomas Cook Group collapsed in 2019 but was relaunched as an online travel agent last year. He has joined other travel industry voices calling on the governmentfor greater clarity. ""For us, the signals are positive, but the details as to how people can travel are missing,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ""hopeful"" foreign travel can begin again on 17 May. French says he's âlooking forwardâ to an industry report from the government'sGlobal Travel Taskforce,externaldue to be published next Monday, which is expected to recommend measures designed to facilitate the return of international tourism as quickly as possible. Anna CollinsonHealth Correspondent The Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial on children and teenagers has been paused while the UK regulator investigates whether there's a possible link with rare blood clots in adults. Prof Andrew Pollard from Oxford University has told the BBC while there are no safety concerns with the trial itself, the paediatric clinical trial will not give any further vaccinations while they await for additional information from the MHRA. Participants in the trial are advised to continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions. About 300 volunteers signed up for the trial which started in February. Researchers are assessing whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17.
Updates from the European Medicines Agency and the MHRA are expected in the coming days. You can read more here. The number of patients in hospital in England with Covid-19 has dropped to its lowest level for six months, figures show. A total of 2,588 patients were in hospital at 08:00 BST, according to figures from NHS England. This is the lowest since the number was 2,435 on 4 October, and is down 92% from a record 34,336 on 18 January. During the first wave of the virus, patient numbers peaked at 18,974 on 12 April. Hospital admissions in England of patients with Covid-19 are at their lowest level for nearly seven months, with 156 admissions reported on Sunday, 4 April. This is the lowest since 153 on 13 September and is down 96% from the peak on 12 January. The fall in patients and admissions reflects the combined impact of the lockdown and vaccines in helping reduce the number of infections that need hospital treatment. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent All
medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe
side effects. The
seasonal flu jab has about a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve
disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. The
key question is whether the risks are worth the benefits. Even
if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest
about one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated in the UK. For
everyone over the age of 75 infected there is one death per eight Covid
infections. For
those in their 40s it is one death per 1,000. On
the face of it, the risk-benefit ratio is clearly in favour of vaccination if you assume you are going to be
infected at some point. But what is needed now is more information about who has been
suffering from these rare blood clots. How old are they? Do they have any
underlying health conditions that could explain what happened? This
will help narrow down the
scale of any potential risks. An
update from the UK regulator - as well as the European one - is expected in the
coming days. The United States is further ramping up its vaccination programme, which has accelerated since Joe Biden took office in January. The Biden administration says all adults will be eligible for a jab by 19 April - almost two weeks earlier than the previous target. President Biden is expected to speak about the vaccination effort later today. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, tells reporters: ""The president will announce officially later this afternoon that we've reached 150 million shots in arms since entering government and that by 19 April all adult Americans will be eligible to get the vaccine. ""That doesn't mean they will get it that day, it means they can join the line that day if they have not already done that beforehand."" Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The process of unlocking society confronts us with a dilemma that will mould the politics of the coming months: what is, simultaneously, epidemiologically safe and yet ethically, practically and politically possible? Having to prove you're not contagious - because you've been jabbed, tested or have immunity - is the very essence of this debate, because without that, argue some, how can social distancing be abandoned in the summer, while providing reassurance that is safe? The government calls its exploration of this idea ""Covid status certification."" But critics, including about 40 Conservative MPs, think it reeks of a ""papers, please"" society; an ID card in all but name. Ministers acknowledge the idea raises ethical issues. It raises colossal practical ones too: the NHS has been asked to look into what ministers call a ""digital and non-digital route"" to demonstrating your Covid status. An app and a scrap - of paper - in other words. The Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs said today the idea would ""lead to a two-tier Britain entirely incompatible with freedom"". And Labour are sceptical too. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have expressed a cautious openness to the idea of a domestic Covid certificate.  Northern Ireland's Health Minister says he doesn't support them. Egyptian authorities have launched an investigation after the body of a coronavirus victim was dug up from a grave and then burnt. According to local media, the remains were those of a hospital nurse who had died of the disease in Helwan, south of Cairo. Such is the stigma surrounding the virus in Egypt there have been reports of some communities being very reluctant to allow its victims to be buried in their cemeteries. In April last year,23 people were arrested for blocking the burial of a doctor who reportedly died with coronavirus. The group were believed to have feared a body buried with the virus could spread it. This video can not be played One of the positive impacts of lockdown is that there has been a big reduction in light pollution. A nationwide star count found a 10% drop in the amount of people who could only see 10 or fewer stars, an indicator of severe light pollution. Light pollution can impact human health and wildlife by disturbing biological cycles and behaviours. The BBC's Justin Rowlatt visited the Kielder Observatory in Northumberland, an area that benefits from some of the darkest skies in England, to explore the impact of having less light pollution. Three in five UK adults have received a first dose of a coronavirus jab, the health secretary says. Some 31,622,367 have received a first vaccine, with 5,496,716 people now fully vaccinated thanks to a second dose - 10.4% of the adult population. Matt Hancock says it is ""fantastic"" news and has tweeted his thanks to ""everyone involved in the vaccine rollout"", saying ""we're making great strides in our national effort"". More than 37 million jabs have been given in the UK - 31.6 million first doses and just under 5.5 million second The president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, has been vaccinated with the Chinese coronavirus jab, Sinopharm, in an attempt to encourage reluctant Serbians to follow suit. A poor uptake prompted the government last month to invite in foreigners to get inoculated. Several thousand Bosnians took up the offer. A similar number marched through the Bosnian capital Sarajevo on Tuesday in protest at their own government's failure to secure enough doses - fewer than 200,000 for a population of 3.5 million. Critics say Serbia's apparent generosity was a sign of its desire to restore its regional dominance, and that the Russian and Chinese vaccines on offer have not been approved for use in Europe. Thousands took to the streets in Sarajevo Meanwhile, in Slovakia fresh doubts have been raised about a controversial stock of Russian vaccine. The drug regulator has reportedly found the unused batch is different from the Sputnik vaccine reviewed by the medical magazine the Lancet. Slovakia PM Igor Matovic resigned last week over the furore caused by his decision to buy the stock without consultation. You can see from these graphs hospitalisations and new Covid cases continue to decline in the UK. You can also see the shift in the government's vaccine rollout to focus on second doses, with more of these now being given than first jabs. Rappers A1 and J1 didn't know each other before meeting on Houseparty Remember awkwardly entering different rooms on Houseparty, when the video chat app took off during the first Covid lockdown? For rappers A1 and J1, that interaction has been life-changing. Without it they would have no viral fame, no collaboration with 2020 Brit Award nominee Aitch, and no song reaching number two in the charts. ""For me, it's just a blessing the position we're in,"" 15-year-old A1 tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. The pair didn't know each other before meeting on Houseparty during lockdown in March 2020. The artists now have 2.6 million monthly listeners on Spotify, with fans including the likes of KSI and Aitch. ""We didn't know it was going to do this well. And then it just started taking off,"" J1, 17, says. Read more on how their collaboration came abouthere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sir Keir Starmer has apologised after visiting a church which has been criticised for its stance towards homosexuality.

"This video can not be played Hunter Biden says his father ""saved"" him several times when he was in a dark place with his addiction battle Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, has reflected on his public struggle with drug and alcohol addiction, saying his life ""is not a tabloid"". ""I don't belong to an administration, I belong to a family,"" he told the BBC. He took responsibility for ""creating a story... that anyone conscious would know would be a tabloid sensation"". He also addressed the scrutiny he and his father faced over his work with Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Mr Biden was a director on the board of Burisma while Joe Biden was US vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on US-Ukrainian relations. Speaking to US broadcaster CBS, he also said he was confident that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing over his business affairs by an ongoing US Department of Justice investigation. The business dealings in Ukraine made him a frequent target of Republican criticism during the 2020 election campaign, and were at the centre of former US President Donald Trump's first impeachment. The impeachment inquiry focused on a conversation Mr Trump had with Ukraine's president in which he appeared to pressure him to open an inquiry into the Bidens. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. Biden and Ukraine: What we know about corruption claims Hang on, why was Trump impeached again? While defending his qualifications for the position at Burisma, Mr Biden said that, in retrospect, he had ""missed... the perception that I would create"". ""I know that it is hard to believe with 20/20 hindsight how I could possibly have missed that,"" the 51-year-old told the BBC in an interview. He added that Burisma saw his name ""as gold"" and that it played a large part in his appointment to the board. While no criminal activity by the Bidens has been proven, a senior US state department official raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest as far back as 2015. An investigation by US Republican lawmakers last yearfound that Hunter Biden's work for the Ukrainian firm was ""problematic""but concluded there was not evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. The report also claimed that Biden relatives ""cashed in on Joe Biden's vice presidency"". The report was slammed by Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, one of Mr Trump's most vocal critics in Congress, who described it as a ""political exercise"". Mr Biden acknowledged that his father's name had ""opened doors that wouldn't be opened up to other people"". But he said this had been ""both a privilege and a burden"". Asked by CBS about the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into his financial dealings,external, the president's son said: ""I can say this, I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing."" US media quote sources saying the investigation relates to business dealings with foreign countries including China. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Joe Biden and a life in politics Speaking to the BBC ahead of the release of his new memoir Beautiful Things, Mr Biden said he wanted to write about ""the love of a family and how it saved me"". ""And, you know, we're going through two pandemics right now... there's the pandemic of coronavirus, and there's a pandemic of addiction too,"" he said. Mr Biden's mother and sister died in a car accident in 1972 that he and his brother survived. In the interview, he talked about the links between the trauma he has suffered and his drug and alcohol addiction. ""There's something at the centre of each addict that's missing, that they feel that they need to fill... Nothing can possibly fill it. And so you numb yourself,"" he said. After his brother Beau died of cancer in 2015,he said he ""descended into a really dark, dark place"". ""My brother had just died, I'd separated with my wife, I was in an apartment by myself, and I was basically drinking myself to death. It was awful. I mean, grief does funny things. And combine that with addiction and it is a really hard thing to overcome,"" he said. Hunter Biden acknowledged that his father's name had ""opened doors"" He added that while his struggle with addiction made him a target for tabloid stories and political attacks, it was also something that people across the country could relate to. ""I think what people see in the Biden family is their family. I think that they see all of the tragedy in loss, but they see all the love and sincerity. And I think that they see that we're not much different than any other family out there,"" he said. In anticipation of Mr Trump raising his addiction in the first election debate, Mr Biden said both he and his father ""intuitively knew what to say"". ""I said 'Dad, you know, this is our story. And it's a story of love. It's a story of hope. It's a story that so many people are going through right now. Just talk to them and know that your honesty and my honesty about where we are is what I think will resonate with the American people.' ""It wasn't a political calculation, it was from the heart."" Looking towards his future, Mr Biden said addiction ""never leaves"" but that many addicts had ""gone on to do incredibly brilliant, great, amazing things"". ""It's about time we started looking at addiction as a mental health issue, rather than an ethical or moral issue,"" he said. Asked about the possibility of his father running for re-election at the age of 82, he said: ""My dad is younger than me in his physical and mental capacity... I don't know anyone that has more energy."" What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?

"This video can not be played PM: some lockdown restrictions to be eased from 12 April Pubs and restaurants serving outside can reopen as planned next Monday, along with non-essential shops, gyms and hairdressers, as England's lockdown is further eased, the PM has said. But Boris Johnson urged caution, saying: ""We can't be complacent."" Officials were examining the potential role of Covid status certificates, he told a Downing Street briefing. Pilot eventswill take place from mid-April to trial the system, with later events checking vaccinations. Speaking in Downing Street, the prime minister also said the government was ""hopeful"" international travel could resume in the next stage of lockdown easing on 17 May, but cautioned against the effects of the surge of coronavirus in other parts of the world. He said the government would set out ""well before 17 May what is reasonable"" and aim to give the aviation industry ""as much notice as possible"". What can I do from 12 April? What is the new traffic light system for holidays? What's happening with pools, haircuts and pubs? Hairdressers and homeware shops reopen in Scotland It comes as the government has publishedan update on a series of reviews,externalinto Covid certificates, the safe return of mass events, international travel and social distancing rules. In the document, the government says it cannot yet confirm international travel can resume on 17 May ""given the state of the pandemic abroad"", and advises people not to book summer holidays abroad ""until the picture is clearer"". It also confirms further details on a risk-based ""traffic light"" system for foreign travel will be published in a report later this week. On Covid status certification, the paper says this could have an important role to play both domestically and internationally and ""is likely to become a feature of our lives"" while the pandemic continues. A certification scheme could record whether people had been vaccinated, recently tested negative or had natural immunity. The NHS is working on digital and non-digital ways for individuals to demonstrate their Covid status, according to the government paper, but there were no details on whether this might include using an app. More than 40 Conservative MPs havesigned a cross-party letteropposing the use of vaccine passports for access to jobs or services, with critics calling such a move ""discriminatory"". The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said vaccine passports had managed to ""achieve the remarkable political feat of uniting a former Labour leader and a former Conservative leader against them"", as he asked the prime minister if there would be a vote in Parliament on their introduction. Mr Johnson said the question of a Commons vote was ""taking too many fences at once"", and that the government needs to work out its proposal. He stressed that certification would not be introduced either for the 12 April lockdown easing or for the planned further changes from 17 May that would see pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors. But he said ""all countries"" were looking at vaccination status for international travel, adding: ""I do think that's going to be part of the way people deal with it and we need to think about that."" The government's review said that public transport and essential shops and services would never require Covid status certification, but it could play a role in allowing people to return to theatres, nightclubs, and events such as festivals or sports fixtures. It is also possible that requiring customers to prove their status could ""play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings"" such as pubs and restaurants, the document states. The government said this would be considered in consultation with the industry, and that businesses should continue to plan to reopen in line with the latest guidance. Labour has backed the move to proceed as planned on 12 April, but shadow health minister Justin Madders told the BBC the party had concerns about how vaccine passports could affect ""liberties and freedoms"". Meanwhile, Tory former chief whip Mark Harper, leader of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptics, has called for Parliament to be given a vote on vaccine passports, warning they would lead to a ""two-tier Britain"". And the Confederation of British Industry said firms would need help to navigate ""ethical, legal and practical implementation challenges"" around status certificates. This video can not be played The prime minister said international from 17 May was ""hopeful"" The further easing of lockdown was expected given the data is perhaps as positive as it possibly could be. Hospital admissions and deaths have fallen sharply. Even infection rates - that some warned would start rising quickly with the reopening of schools - have continued to drop. With the vaccination programme going well, the UK is certainly in a strong position compared to most. What's more, the steps being taken from 12 April are not considered particularly high risk. It's the return of indoor mixing in May that is more of a worry - and then how to allow foreign travel and big events like live sport and music concerts. The prime minister was careful not to make any promises on these. Government modelling suggests a resurgence of hospital cases and deaths is still ""highly likely"" in the future. That's because the vaccine does not work for everyone and not all those in the at-risk groups have come forward for a jab. There's good reason to believe this resurgence will be limited - perhaps no worse than a bad flu season - but it's the possibility it could be much worse that is causing the concern. Speaking alongside England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson said the decision to proceed with the rule changes was ""fully justified by the data"". He said the government could see nothing in the present data to make it deviate from its roadmap, with ""things still seem set fair"" for the next step along on 17 May. But he added: ""We can't be complacent, we can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries."" Hospitality venues can serve food and alcohol to customers sitting outdoors, with no curfew Spas can reopen, as can zoos, theme parks, drive-in cinemas and drive-in performances events Members of the same household can take a holiday in England in self-contained accommodation Public buildings such as libraries and community centres will also reopen Close-contact services such as beauty and nail salons can reopen Weddings attended by up to 15 people can take place The number of care home visitors will also increase to two per resident Mr Johnson encouraged people to use free NHS tests, as everyone in England is to be given access totwo rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Meanwhile, Prof Whitty warned ""this virus will be with us for the foreseeable future"", and Sir Patrick suggested the pandemic could result in long-term changes in behaviour. Separately, the government's scientific advisers have said the next phase of unlocking is ""highly unlikely"" to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. However, later steps such as indoor mixing are ""highly likely"" to lead to a resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths, SPI-M - a subgroup of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - has predicted. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Travel industry leaders expressed frustrationat the lack of ""clarity"" in the latest update on foreign travel. Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"", adding: ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement."" Meanwhile, Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee said the update ""continues to suggest significant barriers to international travel and may push back the date of restart beyond 17 May"", while Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK said it ""does not provide the clarity we were seeking"".
