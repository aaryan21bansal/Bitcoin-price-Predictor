"This video can not be played Catalans sing their anthem 'Els Segadors', or 'The Reapers' Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says the Spanish region has won the right to statehood following a contentious referendum that was marred by violence. He said the door was open to a unilateral declaration of independence after Catalan officials said voters had backed secession with a 42.3% turnout. Spain's government has warned it could suspend Catalan autonomy. The constitutional court banned the vote and almost 900 people were hurt as police tried to stop it going ahead. Officers from the national police and paramilitary Civil Guard seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Catalans had been fooled into taking part in an illegal vote. More than 2.2 million people were reported to have voted, according to Catalan authorities, out of 5.3 million registered voters. Just under 90% of those who voted backed independence, they said. A Catalan spokesman said more than 750,000 votes could not be counted because polling stations were closed and urns were confiscated. Given the chaotic nature of the vote, the turnout and voting figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona. ""With this day of hope and suffering, the citizens of Catalonia have won the right to an independent state in the form of a republic,"" Mr Puigdemont said in a televised address. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was flanked by members of his government as he made his statement ""My government in the next few days will send the results of today's vote to the Catalan parliament, where the sovereignty of our people lies, so that it can act in accordance with the law of the referendum."" He said theEuropean Union could no longer ""continue to look the other way"". This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting The Spanish prime minister spoke of a ""mockery"" of democracy. ""At this hour I can tell you in the strongest terms what you already know and what we have seen throughout this day. There has not been a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia,"" Mr Rajoy said. Spain's justice minister warned that any declaration of independence could lead to article 155 of the country's constitution being invoked which allows the national government to intervene in the running of an autonomous region. ""We are not here to divide Spaniards... but if someone tries to declare independence on behalf of a part of Spain's territory, that cannot be done because it is beyond their powers,"" said Rafael CatalÃ¡. Analysis: Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona Spain's complicated relationship with the region of Catalonia is headed for the unknown. After violence by Spanish police, a declaration of independence by Catalonia's regional government seems more likely than ever before. On Monday the government in Madrid will hold talks with Spanish parties to discuss a response to the biggest political crisis this country has seen in decades. Read more from Tom More than 40 trade unions and Catalan associations called a region-wide strike on Tuesday due to ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"". TV images showed Spanish police kicking would-be voters and pulling women out of polling stations by their hair. Catalan medical officials said 844 people had been hurt in clashes, including 33 police. The majority had minor injuries or had suffered from anxiety attacks. How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote The most powerful images of Catalan clashes The reasons for the referendum In Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Mr Puigdemont was due to vote, and forcibly removed those inside. He voted at another station. The BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona witnessed policebeing chased away,externalfrom one polling booth after they had raided it. TV footage showed riot police using batons to beat a group of firefighters who were protecting crowds in Girona. This woman suffered a head injury in Barcelona The national police and Guardia Civil - a military force charged with police duties - were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote. The Catalan police - the Mossos d'Esquadra - have been placed under Madrid's control, however witnesses said they showed little inclination to use force on protesters. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who voted blank on Sunday, condemned police actions against the region's ""defenceless"" population, but Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had ""acted with professionalism and in a proportionate way"". The Mossos d'Esquadra are held in high esteem by Catalans Large crowds of independence supporters gathered in the centre of the regional capital Barcelona on Sunday evening, waving flags and singing the Catalan anthem. Anti-independence protesters have also held rallies in Barcelona and other Spanish cities. Catalan authorities said 319 of about 2,300 polling stations across the region had been closed by police while the Spanish government said 92 stations had been sealed off. Since Friday, thousands of people have occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. This video can not be played Voters attempt to stop police seizing ballots. Some shouted: ""We will vote! We are peaceful people"" Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. The anti-independence Societat Civil said there were voting irregularities, including the same people voting twice. Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. Who will move next in Catalan crisis?

"One of the UK's largest supermarket chicken suppliers has suspended operations after an investigation allegedly exposed food safety breaches. The 2 Sisters Food Group said staff at its site in the West Midlands will need to be ""appropriately retrained"" before it starts resupplying customers. It comes after allegations that workers had changed slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has also been investigating the claims. The Guardian and ITV News claimedan undercover reporter witnessed workers changing the ""kill dates""on chickens. They also allegedly saw meat of different ages being mixed together and codes on crates of meat altered. Food safety: Five things to watch out for Raw chicken 'should not be washed' In a statement,external, the company said an internal investigation had shown ""some isolated instances of non-compliance"" at its plant in West Bromwich. ""We have therefore decided to temporarily suspend operations at the site to allow us the time to retrain all colleagues, including management, in all food safety and quality management systems."" All staff will remain on full pay and take part in training on site, it added. ""We will only recommence supply once we are satisfied that our colleagues have been appropriately retrained."" Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Lidl and The Co-op have stopped taking chickens from the site while investigations take place. The company also supplies Tesco and Sainsbury's, which are looking into the allegations. 2 Sisters said the FSA had visited the site every day since the allegations came to light and had ""not identified any breaches"".

"It was one of the world's most opulent railway stations, sitting imposingly on the French-Spanish border - but then it fell into disrepair. Now, writes Chris Bockman, the building is showing new signs of life. When they built the station at Canfranc, it was on a grand scale and with no expense spared. It had to be bold and modern - an architect's dream come true, built in iron and glass, complete with a hospital, restaurant and living quarters for customs officers from both France and Spain. At the time it was nicknamed the ""Titanic of the Mountains"". To give you an idea of its size - there are 365 windows, one for each day of the year; hundreds of doors; and the platforms are more than 200m long. The question is, how did such an extravagant  station, high up on a mountainside in a village with a population of just 500 people, ever see the light of day? The ticket hall fell in to disrepair after the French abandoned the train line in 1970 At the turn of the 20th Century, the Spanish and French authorities had a grand project to open up their border through the Pyrenees, enabling more international trade and travel. It was a remarkably ambitious scheme, involving dozens of bridges and a series of tunnels drilled through the mountains. At one point, work stalled as the French workers were sent off to fight in World War One. They were replaced by Spanish counterparts. Celebrating the digging of the Somport tunnel in 1912, which would form part of the international train line The station was built just to the Spanish side of the border, but one of the platforms was still considered French territory - like a kind of foreign embassy. French police and customs staff sent their children to a French-speaking school installed in the village. But the day the station was opened in 1928 by the French President Gaston Doumergue and Spanish King Alfonso XIII, flaws quickly became apparent. The rail gauges were different, so passengers still had to change trains. It made transporting goods as freight too slow. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 didn't help. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST In the early 1930s, as few as 50 passengers a day were using Europe's second-biggest train station. And then things got worse. During the Spanish Civil War, Franco ordered the tunnels on the Spanish side sealed off, to prevent his Republican opponents from smuggling weapons in. When the international line re-opened during World War Two, however, the route was used by thousands of Jews and Allied soldiers to escape into Spain. Disused train carriages sit alongside the rails near Canfranc Today, the mayor of Canfranc is Fernando Sanchez, whose father was a customs officer at the station - he told me it became a spy hub for the Allies, but the Germans also used the rail line to transport gold they'd stolen from Europe. After the war, the French lost interest in the line and allowed it to deteriorate. When a train derailed on the French side in 1970, that signalled the end and France abandoned the line. The Spanish were furious, according to Fernando Sanchez - there was an international agreement to maintain the line and the French were accused of breaking it. Canfranc's population, which had risen to 2,000 thanks to the station, dwindled to 500. The grand building itself went to rot. The tracks rusted, the ceilings fell in with the harsh winter weather and vandalism did the rest. The bar at Canfranc station, which fell in to disrepair But a few years ago the local government in Aragon decided to buy the place and restore it, claiming it was a major part of Spanish history. In the past four years 120,000 people have visited, wearing hard hats - ironically, far more than ever actually used the line when it was in service. Nearly all the tourists are Spanish. They're fascinated by the station's size, and perhaps also a little proud of its symbolism - the image it projected to the world. There are now even two trains a day between Saragossa and Canfranc. Now the Aragon government wants not only to refurbish the station as a hotel, but to build another one right next to it, and relaunch rail travel through the Pyrenees. The French regional government based in Bordeaux has agreed to reopen the line on its side too. Its president, Alain Rousset, told me the route through the achingly beautiful Valley of Aspe will be branded the the ""western trans-Pyrenean line"" when it opens. He promised to find 200 million euros (Â£175m) to pay for it, and Brussels will offer matching funds. Rousset says he has made a lot of enemies by pushing for this plan - pointing out that politicians in Paris had envisaged a motorway instead. Graffiti scrawled on walls in the valley now read ""Long live Canfranc"". The line is back in favour. If all goes to plan, the Titanic of the Pyrenees could be back in business within five years. I noticed that the massive wooden ticket counters at the station have already been restored.

"The attack took place outside the train station in the southern French port city Two young women have been stabbed to death at Marseille's main train station in a suspected terrorist attack. Soldiers on guard at the station shot dead the attacker, who police described as of North African appearance and aged about 30. Witnesses said he shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). So-called Islamic State (IS) said the attacker was one of its ""soldiers"". One victim had her throat slit and the other was stabbed in the stomach. They were both aged 20. President Emmanuel Macron said he was disgusted by the ""barbarous act"" and paid tribute to the soldiers and the police officers who responded. The attack took place by a bench outside the southern French city's Saint Charles train station. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told reporters that the attacker had fled after the first murder but returned to kill again. Macron: Anti-terror drive 'top priority' Is terror threat to Europe greater today? Soldiers were already in the station as part of Operation Sentinelle, which sees combat troops patrol streets and protect key sites amid France's ongoing state of emergency. IS claimed it was behind the attack via its Amaq news outlet. The group regularly claims responsibility for militant attacks it believes are inspired by its ideology. ISrecently released a tapepurportedly of leader Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi in which he urged supporters to step up attacks. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Police are treating this as a terrorist attack, but there are plenty of question marks about the man and his motivation. French media report that the killer was in his 20s with a police record for petty offences. If so, that fits in with a steady pattern of recent attacks in France, carried out by individuals who seem to have a deep hatred of French authority, aggravated by exposure to Islamist ideas. 7-9 Jan 2015- Two Islamist gunmen storm the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 17 people. Another Islamist militant kills a policewoman the next day and takes hostages at a Jewish supermarket in Paris. Four hostages are killed before police shoot the gunman dead.

"There were lengthy delays for motorists in the Winchester area A 17-year-old boy has been charged after ""potentially hazardous material"" forced the closure of the M3 motorway. Thousands of people were stuck in queues for 11 hours on 23 September between junctions nine and 11. The teenager, from Winchester, faces two counts of arson with intent to endanger life and two of causing danger to road users, Hampshire Police said. He will appear before Basingstoke magistrates on Monday over incidents on the M3 on 16 and 23 September. The discovery of the partly-ignited substance, dropped from a bridge, led to military bomb disposal experts being called to the motorway near Winchester. The road was closed shortly before 04:00 BST and had fully reopened by about 15:30. At the time of the incident, police revealed they were also investigating a similar case on the same bridge at about 04:00 BST on 16 September, when an object was dropped on to the carriageway. On that occasion officers found ""a quantity of broken glass"" but no fire. No-one was hurt on either occasion.

"Several locations in the Canadian city were cordoned off by police during the manhunt A Somali-born refugee has been arrested in connection with attacks in Edmonton, Alberta in which five people were injured, officials say. The unnamed 30-year-old man is suspected of stabbing a policeman and injuring four pedestrians on Saturday. The officer was controlling traffic at a Canadian Football League game when he was struck by a car at high speed and then attacked with a knife. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called it a ""terrorist attack"". Edmonton officials say the suspect could face terror and murder-related charges. They add that he had been known to police for believing in extremist ideology. According to broadcasters CBC and CTV, a flag belonging to so-called Islamic State was found inside the vehicle that hit the police officer. The officer and his vehicle were rammed by a car outside Alberta's Commonwealth Stadium on Saturday evening. The driver then stabbed the uniformed officer several times, before fleeing on foot. The van overturned during a police chase Shortly before midnight, a man driving a rented van was pulled over at a checkpoint. His name on documents was said to be ""very similar"" to that of the man police were searching for. The truck then fled the scene, and was pursued by officers. Four pedestrians were struck during the chase in what police say appeared to be a deliberate action. Two injured pedestrians have since been released from hospital and the police officer is recovering from his wounds. Mr Trudeau said he was both ""deeply concerned and outraged"" by ""this senseless act of violence"". Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson urged calm. ""Terrorism is about creating panic and sowing divide about disrupting people's lives,"" he said. ""We can succumb to that or rise above it."" Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Canada is not immune to the forces of extremism and has dealt with attacks before.  In January, a gunman entered a mosque in Quebec City and fired on worshippers, killing six. In 2014, gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a soldier guarding a war memorial in Ottawa before driving to parliament, where he was eventually killed. A few days before, two soldiers were rammed by a car in Quebec province. The suspect was later killed by police. But one soldier was killed and another injured in what was described as an apparent act of home-grown terrorism. Canadians are again shaken by a suspected terror incident that is reminiscent of recent vehicle attacks in European cities like Barcelona, London, and Berlin.

"Monarch is in last-ditch talks with the aviation regulator about renewing its licence to sell package holidays. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) extended Monarch's licence by 24 hours on Saturday amid uncertainty about the company's future. However, with the deadline now passed, the regulator has yet to announce a decision on what it means for the UK's fifth biggest airline. About 10,000 people on holidays sold by the airline are thought to be abroad. The CAA is understood to have contingency plans in place to bring those passengers home on other airlines if Monarch faces difficulties. Monarch had until midnight on Sunday to reach a deal with the CAA - but neither the company nor the CAA have issued updates since then. If the regulator decides not to renew its package holiday licence, consumer confidence in Monarch's scheduled airline operations could also be undermined. Monarch's Atol licence extended for 24 hours Package holidays accounted for a fraction of the 6.3 million passengers Monarch carried last year to 40 destinations from Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham, Leeds-Bradford and Manchester airports. The government's Atol scheme refunds customers if a travel firm collapses and ensures they are not stranded. The agreement with the CAA on Saturday means package holidays bought from Monarch on Sunday are still Atol protected. Monarch's owner, Greybull Capital, has been trying to sell part or all of its short-haul operation so it can focus on more profitable long-haul routes. The airline reported a loss of Â£291m for the year to October 2016, compared with a profit of Â£27m for the previous 12 months, after revenues slumped. Monarch, founded in 1968, is made up of a scheduled airline, tour operator and an engineering division. In total it employs about 2,500 people. The company said its flights are operating as normal, and that it continues to work on plans to resolve its future. Monarch has focused more on destinations such as Spain following terror attacks in Turkey and Egypt Monarch has experienced the perfect storm of challenges in recent years. The terror attacks in Turkey and Egypt have deprived the airline of a large chunk of its annual revenues, and forced it to compete on heavily congested traditional routes to Spain and Greece. That has forced down prices and profits on top of weaker demand from UK travellers - for whom a less valuable pound has made travelling costlier. Monarch will not be facing the winter with much confidence. The short-haul market has been described as ""horrendous"" by senior aviation industry figures. It has already resulted in the collapse of Air Berlin and placed huge pressure on other airlines. Put simply, there are too many seats and not enough bums to put on them to make a profit for all major carriers. Are you currently abroad with Monarch or planning to travel soon?

"Macklemore: ""No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it"" American artist Macklemore sang in support of gay rights at one of Australia's biggest annual sporting events during the country's vote on same-sex marriage. The singer performed a set ahead of kick-off in the National Rugby League (NRL) grand final in Sydney. Opponents had called for the song Same Love to be left out of the show to stop the event becoming ""politicised"". But Macklemore said it ""was one of the greatest honours of my career"". Australians are in the middle of a postal vote on whether gay marriage should be introduced. The poll is non-binding for the government, but has been deeply divisive. Australia's heated same-sex marriage debate Aussie rugby team same-sex marriage spat Tony Abbott's daughter appears in 'Yes' ad Seattle native Macklemore - whose real name is Benjamin Haggerty - had previously told Australia's Channel Nine he would donate his portion of the proceeds from the song's sales in Australia to the Yes campaign.

The song had rocketed to the top of Australia's charts on the iTunes digital music store. Among its lyrics are: ""I might not be the same, but that's not important / No freedom 'til we're equal / Damn right I support it."" A petition asking the NRL to ban what it called an ""LGBTIQ anthem"", started by former rugby league player Tony Wall, gathered thousands of signatures in the lead-up to the final on Sunday.

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was among those calling for the song - one of Macklemore's biggest hits - to be excluded. But the song, accompanied by rainbow pyrotechnics, was the centrepiece of his set in front of 80,000 stadium spectators and was televised around the world. While the music played, the stadium's large screens displayed the NRL logo with the message: ""We stand for equality."" The postal ballot runs for two months, ending on 7 November. Opinion polls have suggested a majority of Australians support same-sex marriage. After Macklemore's performance ended, Melbourne Storm handily defeated their rivals the North Queensland Cowboys34-6 to win the grand final.

"This video can not be played Police were filmed violently tackling voters and appearing to pull a woman by her hair Catalan emergency officials say 761 people have been injured as police used force to try to block voting in Catalonia's independence referendum. The Spanish government had pledged to stop a poll that was declared illegal by the country's constitutional court. Police officers prevented some people from voting, and seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. In the regional capital Barcelona, police used batons and fired rubber bullets during pro-referendum protests. Speaking soon after the polls closed at 20:00 local time (18:00 GMT), Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Catalans had been fooled into taking part in an illegal vote. The Spanish interior ministry said 12 police officers had been hurt and three people arrested. It added that 92 polling stations had been closed. The national police and Guardia Civil - a paramilitary force charged with police duties - were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote from taking place. While Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau condemned police actions against what she called the region's ""defenceless"" population, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had ""acted with professionalism and in a proportionate way"". One voter, JÃºlia Graell, told the BBC that ""police started to kick people, young and old"", adding: ""Today, I have seen the worst actions that a government can do to the people of its own country."" This video can not be played Voters attempt to stop police seizing ballots. Some shouted: ""We will vote! We are peaceful people"" In Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was due to vote, and forcibly removed those looking to place their ballots.

Since Friday, thousands of people have occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. This woman suffered a head injury in Barcelona In some areas, farmers positioned tractors on roads and in front of polling station doors, and school gates were taken away to make it harder for the authorities to seal buildings off. Firefighters acted as human shields between police and demonstrators. Referendum organisers had called for peaceful resistance to any police action.

Before the poll, Spanish authorities seized voting materials, imposed fines on top Catalan officials and temporarily detained dozens of politicians.

But their strategy of physically preventing people from voting has the potential to backfire hugely.

"This video can not be played Eyewitness Anthony Biscardi recalls the moment a prop collapsed on US rockstar Manson Rock star Marilyn Manson was injured during a concert in New York when a large piece of stage scenery fell on him on stage. The prop - apparently two large guns held together with metal scaffolding - fell as he was performing at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Saturday. An eyewitness told the BBC that the singer lay on stage for up to 15 minutes covered by a sheet before he was carried out on a stretcher and taken to hospital. He has cancelled nine tour dates following the injury, according toBillboard magazine,external. Eyewitness Anthony Biscardi told the BBC that fans at the concert ""instantly freaked out"". ""He was performing the song Sweet Dreams. Towards the middle of the song it seemed as though he tried climbing onto a prop. ""The first touch of weight on those poles and it came crashing down onto him."" The 48-year-old 'shock rock' star has been nominated for four Grammy awards In videos of the incident posted online, stage crew and band members can be seen lifting the prop off the singer but he does not get back up. ""He was pretty limp, almost as though he was unconscious,"" Mr Biscardi said. Mr Biscardi said a black sheet was put around him until he could be taken off stage, when an announcement was made that the show was cancelled ""due to injury"". A representative toldRolling Stone,externalmagazine that: ""Manson suffered an injury towards the end of his incredible NYC show. He is being treated at a local hospital."" The 48-year-old artist was three dates into his The Heaven Upside Down Tour. He was due to perform in Boston on Monday night.

"The attack took place outside the train station in the southern French port city Two young women have been stabbed to death at Marseille's main train station in a suspected terrorist attack. Soldiers on guard at the station shot dead the attacker, who police described as of North African appearance and aged about 30. Witnesses said he shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). So-called Islamic State (IS) said the attacker was one of its ""soldiers"". One victim had her throat slit and the other was stabbed in the stomach. They were both aged 20. President Emmanuel Macron said he was disgusted by the ""barbarous act"" and paid tribute to the soldiers and the police officers who responded. The attack took place by a bench outside the southern French city's Saint Charles train station. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told reporters that the attacker had fled after the first murder but returned to kill again. Macron: Anti-terror drive 'top priority' Is terror threat to Europe greater today? Soldiers were already in the station as part of Operation Sentinelle, which sees combat troops patrol streets and protect key sites amid France's ongoing state of emergency. IS claimed it was behind the attack via its Amaq news outlet. The group regularly claims responsibility for militant attacks it believes are inspired by its ideology. ISrecently released a tapepurportedly of leader Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi in which he urged supporters to step up attacks. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Police are treating this as a terrorist attack, but there are plenty of question marks about the man and his motivation. French media report that the killer was in his 20s with a police record for petty offences. If so, that fits in with a steady pattern of recent attacks in France, carried out by individuals who seem to have a deep hatred of French authority, aggravated by exposure to Islamist ideas. 7-9 Jan 2015- Two Islamist gunmen storm the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 17 people. Another Islamist militant kills a policewoman the next day and takes hostages at a Jewish supermarket in Paris. Four hostages are killed before police shoot the gunman dead. The other two gunmen are cornered and killed by police in a siege 13 Nov 2015- IS jihadists armed with bombs and assault rifles attack Paris, targeting the national stadium, cafes and Bataclan concert hall. The co-ordinated assault leaves 130 people dead, and more than 350 wounded 13 Jun 2016- A knife-wielding jihadist kills a police officer and his partner at their home in Magnanville, west of Paris. He declares allegiance to IS, and police later kill him 14 Jul 2016- A huge lorry mows down a crowd of people on the Nice beachfront during Bastille Day celebrations, killing 86. IS claims the attack - by a Tunisian-born driver, later shot dead by police 26 Jul 2016- Two attackers slits the throat of a priest at his church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, in Normandy. They are shot dead by police 3 Feb 2017- A machete-wielding Egyptian man shouting ""Allahu akbar"" attacks French soldiers at Paris's Louvre Museum - he is shot and wounded 20 Apr 2017- A known terror suspect opens fire at police on the Champs Elysees in Paris, killing one and wounding two. He is shot dead - and the assault is claimed by IS Update 12 October 2017:  This article has been amended to give the correct age of one of the victims.

"This video can not be played Newly-reformed GCSEs are leaving teenagers 'spaced out and stressed out', Lauren Stocks tells Labour delegates It was a moment that caught the Labour party conference off-guard. Sixteen-year-old Lauren Stocks had just received her GCSE results and wanted to talk about the toll that changes to the exams had taken on her and her classmates. In a passionate speech, she articulated the scale of the mental health problems that blight her generation. ""There's a statistic we were shown when I was about 13 or 14 that told me three in 10 people in every classroom suffer with a mental illness. Using strong language, she denied that to be the case. ""It's a good half. ""I could've walked into any food tech, history, art, maths classroom and just watched seas of spaced-out, stressed-out, depressed kids, in a battlefield where they can't afford pens and paper,"" she said, gulping hard. ""It is a disgusting sight,"" she told delegates, and urged parents of teenagers with newly-reformed GCSEs ahead of them to make sure they know they are loved. In under three minutes, Lauren delivered a speech conveying the impatience of youth. (""I didn't make notes before I came on stage and my thoughts will be fairly scattered, so please go easy on me."") Her audience were on their feet, cheering Lauren for a speech that's since been shared thousands of times on social media. Lauren has been a Labour party member since the age of 14 ""It felt pretty weird,"" she tells the BBC. ""I was kind of in my own little world. ""To see everyone stand up - I really appreciated it."" And the plaudits didn't stop there. ""My Snapchat blew up,"" she says. About 30 people from her old school contacted her to say they were really glad she had spoken up for them. ""I have suffered with many a mental health issue. I was worried it was just me but the response was overwhelming."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some social media users though, with characteristic brutality, were less than warm, criticising her choice of hair dye and appearance. The impact of these negative comments is something her mum, Sarah Hilton, worries about a lot but Lauren less so. ""They're saying: 'That's not a girl'. ""When I checked last night, I was definitely female,"" she says, laughing it off. She also diplomatically brushes off the inevitable parallels being drawn with a famous 1977 Conservative conference speech by another 16-year-old, which was watched by a smiling prime minister-in-waiting - Margaret Thatcher. ""I haven't seen the speech but I have studied William Hague,"" she says. ""I don't have the best opinion of him."" Lauren's mum, Sarah Hilton, says her daughter has been educating her about politics Despite her years, Lauren is no stranger to public speaking. Now under-19 representative for North West Young Labour, she has been an activist for two years. Her interest in politics was first piqued at 12 as she idly watched YouTube videos of people discussing left-wing ideas. After a brief dalliance with the Greens, she joined the Labour party on 3 August 2015. ""I remember if as if it were yesterday,"" she says, almost wistfully. A few weeks later, Lauren received an email asking people to attend a Manchester food bank that leader Jeremy Corbyn would be visiting. ""I asked mum if I could go. I'd never been into Manchester alone before. ""My mum dropped me off at the food bank and after that they kept me involved,"" she says. After her experience of sitting the new GCSEs, she says students should be empowered and told what they can achieve, not threatened that if they fail, they'll be left watching Jeremy Kyle all day. This year's GCSE students in England were the first to sit exams which were numerically graded and tougher than in the past. The changes, introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove, resulted in a dip in results, but schools minister Nick Gibb said pupils and teachers were rising to the challenge. Exam regulators said the new qualifications had allowed students to better demonstrate their abilities and had better prepared them for further study. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We recognise there are challenges facing the profession including a more demanding curriculum and higher expectations for pupils. Where staff are struggling we trust head teachers to take action to tackle the causes of stress and ensure they have the support they need. ""The government has also taken steps to reduce the burden of exams on young people including removing multiple, pointless resits and investing Â£1.4 billion in children's mental health services"". Lauren met veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner at the party conference Conference was, Lauren admits, a fast-paced eye-opener but also a chance to meet her heroes, Dennis Skinner (""soon-to-be Sir""), writer and activist Owen Jones (""I love him so much"") and Laura Smith (""a rising star who I hope to see in Cabinet""). For all her enthusiasm for politics and its people - and despite lobbying from her mum - she is not certain that's where her future lies. Lauren is now studying history, sociology and politics at college, and plans to stand for council in 2019. But beyond that, she says she has no political ambitions.

"Debbie McGee and her dance partner Giovanni Pernice topped the Strictly leaderboard Strictly Come Dancing continues to outpace ITV rival The X Factor in the competition for Saturday night views. An average of 9.3 million people saw Saturday's episode, making it the day's most watched show with a 45% viewing share. The X Factor attracted 4.9 million viewers, slightly up on last week but its peak fell from 6m to 5.8m. The BBC and ITV shows, which overlap for 50 minutes, have long competed for viewers during one of TV's prime slots. Strictly's episode did better than its 2016 equivalent, which had an average of 8.6m views. It had a peak viewing of 10.2m, compared to 9.5m in 2016. This was despite some concern that the celebrity contestants in the dancing competition are less popular than in previous years. Who's still in Strictly Come Dancing? Strictly judge's other role.

"What do you do if your child frightens you? What if they seem unable to feel empathy and don't care about punishment? Children with what psychiatrists call ""Callous Unemotional Traits"" are more likely to go to prison and may, in extreme cases, become psychopaths in adulthood. Jane and Paul say parents in this difficult situation need more help. Jane:When Max came to us, our whole world was turned upside down. We were really thrown in at the deep end, we didn't know whether we were coming or going. It was a huge adjustment for us. Paul:Max is adopted and there's always a certain amount of uncertainty that comes with that. We realised very early on that there were some problems, but you hope that with the support of other people then you're going to be able to overcome those. Jane:We knew adopting Max was a risk before he came to live with us, but what we were led to believe was: ""Give him a secure home, family life, make him feel safe, give him all those things that he hasn't had and in timeâ¦"" It's always: ""In time, in time, in time."" We had his history when we adopted him so we knew he'd had a lot of problems at school previously. On his first day when we put him into the primary school here they were struggling. There were lots of days when they couldn't cope with him. He hit out at other children as well. There was one instance where he knocked the glasses off another pupil. It's not playground fights - he has never fought against a peer or an equal for any reason, it's always just that he's unhappy and he goes for someone to let out his unhappiness. Jane:There was a time when he got a knife, it was a small knife from the kitchen, and he started putting it up against another child. Within a few months Max had been excluded. We realised: ""This is a child we never expected to have to manage."" The first time I went to CAMHS [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services] they said: ""He's still settling in."" I don't cry often but I was in tears because I thought: ""We really, really need help, we are out of our depth with him."" Paul:It's always been difficult at home. Early on he was obviously much smaller so you could pick him up, but now he's a teenager, he's much larger, he's able to push his weight around, and to restrain him you have to actually use quite a lot of force. He's got a younger sister, and we have to physically get between the two of them, to make sure that she doesn't get hurt by him. We can't leave them alone together. It's very much like having a toddler and a new-born baby all the time. At night when they go to bed, I stay upstairs with them until Max's sister has gone to sleep because we can't trust him not to do something. We're monitoring him, supervising him, from him waking up until he goes to sleep. This video can not be played A teenager exhibiting 'callous unemotional traits' and his parents speak to Radio 4's Today Jane:I remember the first time we called the police. I'd noticed that Max had something in his pocket, so I said: ""What's that?"" He didn't want me to know. I said: ""Max, you've got to hand me over whatever you've got in your pocket because I know it's something that you shouldn't have."" He went mad and pushed me. So I went upstairs and he knocked me over - I fell up the stairs. Then he sat on the sofa there, and Paul sat beside him and said: ""Calm down, we've got to find out where you got this, what it is."" Then Max started screaming and shouting, and hitting Paul. We'd been told to call the police if he got out of hand but we were very reluctant to do it. The upshot was that it was something Max had stolen. Paul:I think we are in physical danger - it's an abusive relationship, if he was an adult that's how you would talk about it. Jane:The day before yesterday you could say Max assaulted me three times because I wouldn't agree with what he wanted to do. The first one was quite a bad push. The second time he had me in a wrangle but I managed to pull away from him. The last one was when he wanted money to go out and I didn't have the change. I didn't want to give him a Â£20 note because it's very hard to get the money back from him. He was saying: ""No, I want it! I want it!"" There were all these things on the table and he pushed them all off and then he went for me. He was really annoyed. He doesn't go to finish it off, if you know what I mean, but he definitely does go to hit you and hurt you. Paul:He can be very intimidating. He'll be in your face, very aggressive, shouting and swearing at you, threatening, pointing. Jane:We're under a child protection care plan. It should be an adult protection plan because Max is hitting me and his sister constantly. So we have the same care plan in place as if we had been abusing him, and that's really very hard for us to accept, but they say that's the only thing that they can use to monitor him. Paul:He's got very little impulse control and he will store things up for quite a long time to try to get his own back. But he does have some very good characteristics as well. Jane:He's got some very charming aspects to his personality. I think he can make people happy because he's quite good fun sometimes. I imagine that if he managed to tone down his behaviour and became a salesman, he would sell - he's really good at getting people to buy into him and what he wants. He's a very interesting character. He was more affectionate when he was younger. I don't know if he feels like he needs us less, but there can be quite a period of time before you get any affectionate moments from him now. Sometimes he can say quite horrible things - but you know he doesn't mean them really. They can't express their feelings openly and hide their feelings from others They don't seem to know right from wrong They seem very cold and uncaring They try to hurt the feelings of other people and don't care who they hurt to get what they want They don't apologise to people they have hurt They don't show remorse when they have done something wrong They don't care if they are in trouble They don't easily admit to being wrong They are not concerned about schoolwork and don't care about doing things well They don't care about punctuality Source: Professor Stephen Scott, Child and Adolescent psychiatrist, King's College London Jane:At one point I had to go into hospital. The day before I went in Max was really acting up, he was throwing everything, pulling everything, hitting his sister. I was thinking: ""God, at least I'm going to get relief, I almost prefer going to hospital tomorrow and being under sedation for the day - at least it's a way out."" Max was just so difficult to manage. He was seeing a psychologist at the time, but he couldn't seem to help because Max won't reflect on his actions. Nobody seemed to be able to help us, they'd just give us reward charts, but nobody could give us any practical advice on how to manage him. Max had a therapist who said: ""I can't do anything for him. You're wasting your time coming here because I can't get through to Max. All I can do is tell you to stick with it."" We eventually got Max into another primary school with a special unit. They struggled with him but they were very good and he managed to do two years without any exclusion. Family Futures, an independent adoption support and adoption agency, said adopted children often need specialised help to address sometimes abusive and traumatic backgrounds. ""In our experience this type of presentation in adopted and looked after children is often as a result of in utero and early infancy trauma that shapes the child's developing brain and nervous system. This leads to highly defensive and hard wired neuro physiological and psychological responses. ""The majority of children placed for adoption today have come from abusive and traumatic backgrounds and this has shaped their experience of the world and their behaviour. ""Traditional therapeutic interventions are not effective with this population of children. Specialist, holistic approaches based on biopsychosocial formulations are better suited to encourage the child to feel safe in the world and to develop their capacity to openly engage in reciprocal relationships with others. ""This bringing together of information about the interaction of biological factors, psychological factors and social factors is the approach needed for these children. ""That Max's early life experience was not considered runs a real risk of our society's most vulnerable adopted and looked after children being pathologised and seen as inherently flawed, when in fact we need to acknowledge and address their developmental trauma early on if we cannot prevent it happening in the first instance. ""This means the government ensuring appropriate therapeutic interventions are available to such children and families. ""As in the case of Max, Family Futures often see children who other therapists have said that they cannot help, but with the right approach, significant changes can be made."" Family Futures,external Paul:I do love him, you can't put this much effort in to a relationship and not care, but it's relentless pressure. There's never an incident-free day. Every so often we think we've got to the limit of what we can take. The plan now is to try to get Max into a residential school. We think that by doing that it will get rid of the pressure of him being here all the time and hopefully that defuses the situation, but we haven't been able to find the right place for him at this point. Jane:We can't continue as we are. We've had it up to here. If we don't get the boarding school option we're going to have to enforce Section 20, which means that we put Max back in care. In fact we came close to doing that a few weeks ago. We have fully adopted him, he is our son, so what we are saying is that we cannot care for this child and we are putting him back into the care system. It would be a devastating thing for him, for his sister, for us. But it may be the only way we can survive this. All names have been changed.

"The Nevada Department of Corrections shared this image of OJ Simpson being released The former American football star and actor OJ Simpson has been released on parole after nine years in a Nevada jail. He had been serving time for armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and 10 other charges over a 2007 confrontation at a Las Vegas hotel. Simpson wasapproved for early parole releaseat a board hearing in July. In 1995 he was acquitted of the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. In aFacebook post,external, Nevada Department of Corrections released an image and video of Simpson signing documents and leaving Lovelock Correctional Centre early on Sunday. They confirmed the 70-year-old had been released from the facility at 00:08 (07:08 GMT). He will face restrictions - including up to five years of parole supervision. This video can not be played Four things OJ did in while in prison Simpson has expressed his desire to move to Florida after leaving jail.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says the government ""has to look again"" at the issue of tuition fees Theresa May has admitted a change in her party's approach on tuition fees in England, saying she has listened to voters and fees will freeze at Â£9,250. Fee repayment thresholds will also rise, so graduates will start paying back loans once they earn Â£25,000, rather than Â£21,000, the PM said. She said the whole student finance system would be reviewed and did not rule out a move to a graduate tax. Labour, which wants to scrap tuition fees, called the plan ""desperate"". The prime minister, who is in Manchester for her party's conference,also pledged to extend the Help to Buy schemewhich helps people buy newly-built homes, in an attempt to win over younger voters. The Olympic cost of PM's tuition fees plan 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees 'I worry about money most of the time' How to own a home by the age of 25 Tories 'urgently need more volunteers' Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she plans to apologise to Conservative activists for her decision to call a snap election. She said the message she had taken from the election, at which she lost her Commons majority, was that the Conservatives needed to ""listen to voters,"" particularly younger people and those who are ""just about managing"". She said that when the government increased student fees it had been expected that there would be a ""diversity in the system,"" with some universities offering shorter and cheaper courses, rather than always charging the maximum amount. ""That hasn't happened. We've got to look at it again,"" she told Marr. Asked if there could be a graduate tax instead of the current system, she said: ""By looking at it again we will be looking at the issues that people are raising, we will be looking at where the system has worked, we will be looking at the concerns that people have."" The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday The planned Â£250 increase in tuition fees for 2018-19 to Â£9,500 will not go ahead and fees will instead remain at the current maximum of Â£9,250 per year. The overhaul of the higher education sector could also see the introduction of fast-track, two-year degree courses, an idea which has been suggested to limit the costs for young people considering higher education. Other ideas being considered by the government as part of the overhaul are cutting the interest rates on loans and introducing lower fees for students studying certain subjects, such as engineering, where there is a skills shortage. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said he wanted to see the government going further by  reintroducing maintenance grants for the poorest students and reducing interest rates for low and medium earners. ""We also need to do more to reverse the worrying decline in the numbers of part-time and mature students,"" he added. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust education think tank, agreed that maintenance grants should be reintroduced and also called for fees to be means-tested so those from low-income families repay less. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the move was ""a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass because they have no plans for young people and no ideas for our country"". She added: ""They are yesterday's party."" By Sean Coughlan, BBC education correspondent Calling this a ""freeze"" on tuition fees in England is a distinctly positive spin on abandoning a policy of increasing fees above Â£9,250 only put in place this year. If not a U-turn, it's certainly a Uni-turn. But it shows how quickly the politics have changed - with rising fees and ballooning debts now a toxic combination for any party wanting to court young voters. Although billed as a change of direction, universities had already predicted thata fee rise was ""dead in the water""because, without a majority, the government had no realistic prospect of pushing it through. Perhaps more significant is the increase in the earnings threshold for repayments - up from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000. There is also the promise of re-examining interest rates for loans, hiked to 6.1% from this autumn. But this will be the first time an announced fee rise has had to be ditched. The question will be whether cancelling an increase will be a bold enough move compared with promises to scrap them altogether. Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, welcomed the move, saying increasing the repayment threshold from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000 could save many lower and middle earning graduates thousands of pounds. Writing on his Facebook page,external, he said ""every single graduate earning over Â£21,000 a year will pay less"". ""And it has a long-term progressive benefit too,"" he added. ""As most graduates won't clear their loans in full before it's wiped - by reducing what they repay each year, you reduce what they repay in total too."" However, he said details were still ""sketchy"" and it was unclear who it would apply to. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme is currently only available on newly-built homes in England The Help to Buy expansion will see Â£10bn go to another 135,000 buyers in order to help them to own their own home. The funding will allow recipients to get a mortgage with a deposit of just 5%. The money can only be put towards the purchase of new-build homes. The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday - when Mrs May will be the final speaker in Manchester. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent in Manchester The conference slogan isn't ""anything but Brexit"", but listen to what the party's high command wants to talk about here in the next few days, and it might as well be. There is a clear attempt by senior Conservatives here to change the subject; stray beyond the ever present - and divisive - topic of leaving the European Union, and flesh out the government's domestic political priorities. Ministers want to be seen to be addressing an Achilles heel for them at the general election - young people, who overwhelmingly rejected them in June. Hence two policies pitched directly at them: university tuition fees in England, and getting on the property ladder. The political reality, though, is Brexit - the defining political issue of our time - will never be far from the lips of people here. And neither too will the precarious state of the party and its leader, after the humiliation of going backwards in an election Theresa May called voluntarily.

"This video can not be played Police were filmed violently tackling voters and appearing to pull a woman by her hair Catalan emergency officials say 761 people have been injured as police used force to try to block voting in Catalonia's independence referendum. The Spanish government had pledged to stop a poll that was declared illegal by the country's constitutional court. Police officers prevented some people from voting, and seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. In the regional capital Barcelona, police used batons and fired rubber bullets during pro-referendum protests. Speaking soon after the polls closed at 20:00 local time (18:00 GMT), Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Catalans had been fooled into taking part in an illegal vote. The Spanish interior ministry said 12 police officers had been hurt and three people arrested. It added that 92 polling stations had been closed. The national police and Guardia Civil - a paramilitary force charged with police duties - were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote from taking place. While Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau condemned police actions against what she called the region's ""defenceless"" population, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had ""acted with professionalism and in a proportionate way"". One voter, JÃºlia Graell, told the BBC that ""police started to kick people, young and old"", adding: ""Today, I have seen the worst actions that a government can do to the people of its own country."" This video can not be played Voters attempt to stop police seizing ballots. Some shouted: ""We will vote! We are peaceful people"" In Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was due to vote, and forcibly removed those looking to place their ballots. Mr Puigdemont was able to vote at another polling station. The most powerful images of Catalan clashes The reasons for the referendum The BBC's Tom Burridge, in Barcelona, witnessed policebeing chased away,externalfrom one polling booth after they had raided it. Since Friday, thousands of people have occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. This woman suffered a head injury in Barcelona In some areas, farmers positioned tractors on roads and in front of polling station doors, and school gates were taken away to make it harder for the authorities to seal buildings off. Firefighters acted as human shields between police and demonstrators. Referendum organisers had called for peaceful resistance to any police action. Why these are uncharted waters for Spain How FC Barcelona were caught up in the vote Meanwhile, FC Barcelona's match against Las Palmaswas played behind closed doors, after Barcelona said the football league refused to suspend the game. This video can not be played Police use batons on a crowd Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain's distinctive north-eastern region Pressure for a vote on self-determination has grown over the past five years. But Spanish unionists argue Catalonia already enjoys broad autonomy within Spain, along with other regions like the Basque Country and Galicia. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence Mr Rajoy says the vote goes againstthe constitution,external, which refers to ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards"". Central government spokesman IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo accused the Catalan government of being inflexible and one-sided, but it is a charge that Catalan nationalists have thrown back at Madrid itself. The Spanish governmentput policing in Catalonia under central controland ordered the regional force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to help enforce the ban on the illegal referendum. Before the poll, Spanish authorities seized voting materials, imposed fines on top Catalan officials and temporarily detained dozens of politicians. Police have also occupied the regional government's telecommunications centre. Spain says a number of factors ensure the poll does not adhere to international standards: the Spanish interior minister said the computer system preventing people from voting twice was not working from Sunday morning. On top of that, any result would not be legally binding, as the poll had been blocked by the Constitutional Court. How Spain tried to stop the vote By Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona The Spanish government has always said that it's the Spanish courts ordering the Spanish police to act. But their strategy of physically preventing people from voting has the potential to backfire hugely. Had you asked me 24 hours ago whether or not I thought it realistic that Catalonia's regional government would declare independence from Spain in the next few days I would have said probably not. But after the very ugly scenes we've seen across this city and this region today I think it is a very real possibility. If that happens then we're into the unknown.

"Several European countries have imposed a full-face veil ban and others are considering it Legislation banning full-face Muslim veils in public spaces has gone into effect in Austria. The government says the law, which says faces must be visible from the hairline to the chin, is about protecting Austrian values. It comes ahead of a general election later this month which could see gains by the far-right Freedom Party. Muslim groups have condemned the law, saying just a tiny minority of Austrian Muslims wear full-face veils. The law bans Muslim veils such as the burka or niqab, but also places restrictions on the use of medical face masks and clown makeup. An estimated 150 women wear the full burka in Austria but tourism officials have expressed fears that the measures will also deter visitors from the Gulf. The Islamic veil: A debate across Europe What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? Far-right defeated in Austria vote France and Belgium introduced a burka ban in 2011 and a similar measure is currently going through the Dutch parliament.

" A Sikh, two Muslims, a Jew, a Christian and a Buddhist walk into a room. The six men aren’t setting up a punchline, but holding a community meeting here on No 5 Road in Richmond, British Columbia. Balwant Sanghera has been planning the float for the annual Canada Day parade, and reminds everyone that they can participate. Azeem Moledina wants to talk about weekend parking. Abba Brodt would like to make the street more pedestrian-friendly. Frank Klassen is new to the area and is meeting many for the first time. All in all, it’s a pretty typical neighbourhood association meeting, filled with cups of tea and small talk. But No 5 Road is not a typical neighbourhood - the street and the surrounding area is home to about 20 places of worship: Buddhist and Hindu temples, a Sunni and a Shia Mosque, and several churches, preaching in English, Mandarin, Minnanese, Cantonese, Arabic, Hindi, and Punjabi. Sanghera, a member of the Gurdwara Nanak Niwas, or Sikh temple, likes to call it the Highway to Heaven. “I do not think there is any [other] place like this,” he says. Since 2013, Sanghera has been encouraging members from all the houses of worship on the street to meet every few months. Balwant Sanghera “It gives everybody a lifeline to understand that there’s so much that unites us,” says Abba Brodt, the head teacher at Richmond Jewish Day School. Brodt shares Sanghera’s enthusiasm for the community, and has helped organise volunteer events for his students and students from Az-Zahraa Islamic Academy, next door on the No. 5 road. “I think every parent understands what we’re trying to do, it’s not about politics, it’s about trying to do good in this world.”Religious harmony doesn’t always come naturally, Sanghera admits. Even though they are right next door to each other, many groups on the road still stick to what he calls their own “cubby hole,” rarely venturing outside their own cultural or religious community. Abba Brodt Sanghera lived through the war between India and Pakistan in 1965 and says he has seen first-hand how misguided beliefs about cultural superiority can lead to violence. “Some people get so hung up on 'Oh my religion is better than yours!' And that’s wrong, that’s something we have to overcome.” So Sanghera is perhaps the biggest cheerleader for the Highway to Heaven as a symbol for Canadian multiculturalism, always cooking up a new activity for people to do, be it serving a communal lunch in the Gurudwara’s kitchen, or building a float in the annual Canada Day parade. Inside But not every problem is easily solved by more parking or parade floats. Mourners attend the funeral of the men killed at a Quebec City mosque Last winter, a gunman killed six men during evening prayers at a Quebec City mosque, which left many Muslims across Canada feeling alone and afraid. The act of hate made it clear why the Highway to Heaven is still very much needed, says Azeem Moledina, a member of Az-Zahraa Islamic Centre, who does public relations for the mosque. “It was a blizzard, I remember. It was cold, it was sub-zero temperatures, the roads were slippery, but I had communities from all over Richmond come by,” he says. “They held their hands together and they supported us in our time of grief and sadness, because it was a time of grief and sadness for all of Canada.” No 5 road wasn’t always such a heavenly destination. View from the air near the north end of No 5 Road looking towards Vancouver (City of Richmond Archive) For decades, it was just a sleepy by-way on the outskirts of Richmond, a suburb of Vancouver. On one side of the street, there were acres and acres of farmland. On the other, a quiet row of mid-century houses. But in the 1980s, the city of Richmond found itself in the middle of an immigration boom, with newcomers pouring in from China, the Philippines, Taiwan and India. With them, they brought not only the languages, cuisines and traditions of their home countries, but their religions as well. One of the first organisations to come to the street was the Gurudwara. Members bought an 11-acre farm and farmhouse on No 5 Road in 1984, and converted the farmhouse into a place of worship. Other faiths soon followed, and in 1990, the city rezoned the area to officially allow cultural and religious organisations to build along the road. As the road grew, immigrants built large cultural hubs where they could not only practise their faith, but be reminded of where they come from. “Whenever we worship I am reminded of the way my ancestors worshipped,” says Jonathan Wang, while sipping tea in the library of Ling Yen Mountain Temple. In another room, nuns in putty-coloured robes are chanting softly, while worshippers quietly go in and out of the temple’s elaborate courtyard. Built in 1996, the temple is by far one of the most impressive buildings on the highway, with lush gardens, colourful murals and ornate gilded eaves. A small pear tree flourishes on its expansive grounds, a nod to the land’s agricultural past. Faith did not strike Mr Wang all at once; for him, it was more of a slow awakening. For years, he dropped his wife off on No. 5 Road without going inside the temple himself. But as he grew older, he says, he started thinking more about what might be waiting for him after death. He longed to connect with his family back in Taiwan, and he came to cherish Buddhist teachings of reincarnation. “I came to see it not just as a Buddhist temple but as a community where people come to get in touch with their culture.” At the meeting, Frank Klassen is notably quiet. He’s been a pastor at Trinity Pacific Church for almost a year, but it’s his first-time meeting many of the men around the table, and he has some trepidation. Can they shake hands in their religion? Is it rude to drink tea if others are fasting? Who is vegetarian and who isn’t? “There’s kind of a cautious getting to know each other that takes time,” he says. Located directly across from Ling Yen Mountain Temple, Trinity Pacific is part of the Church of God (Anderson) movement, which emphasises personal faith and one’s relationship with God over liturgical practice. The importance of this relationship to his church and his faith can make Rev Klassen feel a bit “queasy” when people talk about the “highway to heaven”. “Ultimately the road that leads to heaven is a narrow path, it’s not a smorgasbord,” he says. Rev Klassen said he’s happy to participate in community events and wants to be a good neighbour but ultimately he’s more concerned with strengthening the faith of his own congregation. Practicing musical worship at Trinity Pacific After leaving the meet-and-greet with his neighbours, he pulls out his Bible and turns to Matthew 7:14. “Enter through the narrow gate,"" he reads. ""For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.” When the Canadian government announced it would be dramatically increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed into the country in 2015, it triggered an outpouring of support from across the country. It was no different on the Highway to Heaven. The BC Muslim Association, a Sunni mosque and cultural association located around the corner from No 5 Road, on Blundell Road, had worked with church groups both on and off the highway to sponsor refugees before. But this was the first time they would be applying to sponsor refugees on their own. Their neighbours on the highway supported them, giving money, food and kitchen items. After raising more than C$500,000, the mosque was allowed to sponsor 47 refugees to come to Canada. The project was especially close to the heart of Shawkat Hasan, who spearheaded the campaign. He was just a boy when the First Arab-Israeli war broke out in the late 1940s and his family fled from the city of Ramla to a United Nations refugee camp. One day, in a bag of clothing donated by the Red Cross, he found a note pinned inside a man’s coat. “Please write me back,” the note said in English, along with an address in Abbotsford, British Columbia. The eight-year-old Hasan did, and thus began his long correspondence with Isaac Braun, a Mennonite from Canada who was involved with raising money to support refugees. Shawkat Hasan The two struck up a friendship that would bring them both halfway around the world. Braun attended Hasan’s high school graduation and helped him get into a Mennonite University in the United States, which in turn set Hasan on the path to a job with the United Nations Refugee Agency in Europe. Hasan says that it was Braun, a Mennonite, who taught him about the impact that one person can have on the lives of others. “We are all human beings created by the same god for the same destiny,” Hasan says, while sitting outside the BC Muslim Association before evening prayers. ""People are arguing and killing each other for no reasons, except to create more misery.” When he was finally ready to retire and his own two daughters were ready to go to university, Hasan decided to move his family to Canada, where Braun had lived. “In Canada, as soon as you step out of the airplane you are no different than everyone else,” he says.

"The claim:Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, tweeted this week: ""Wales is becoming the Botany Bay of 21st century. England shoving its urban poor onto the hulks & shipping them off to Wales."" It follows the UK government announcement of plans to build a new prison in south Wales. Reality Check verdict:In March of this year, figures show more Welsh prisoners were held in England than English prisoners in Wales. But if you look at plans to expand prison capacity in Wales this could be reversed in future. The most up-to-date figures I could get my hands on show there were 4,787 Welsh prisoners in March 2017. By Welsh prisoner I mean the prisoner gave an address in Wales. 1,970 of these prisoners were serving their sentence in England. By comparison, there were 714 English prisoners (home address in England) in Welsh jails. So, if you look at it in terms of the export and import of prisoners between Wales and England, there was a net export of 1,256 prisoners from Wales to England. Hardly Botany Bay, where Britain set up a penal colony in the 18th century. British convicts were shipped to Botany Bay, Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries Before we go on, it's worth noting that prisons are not devolved, soHer Majesty's Prison and Probation Service,externaloperates across England and Wales. This means that, in theory, all the prisons could be in Wales, or indeed, in England. It's one administrative area. It also means that prisoners are not usually classified as English or Welsh by theMinistry of Justice,external(MoJ). However, it is possible to designate a prisoner as Welsh or English by their stated address and to request this data from the MoJ in the form of a ""Freedom of Information,external"" (FOI) request. Indeed, the figures given above for March 2017, come from an FOI request made by the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University. But these figures don't tell the whole story. Another way of testing the Botany Bay claim is to look at whether there are more spaces available in Welsh prisons than Welsh prisoners. Again, it's worth noting that some prisoners, including women and category A prisoners, simply can't be housed in Wales at all because there are no facilities for them. So there is always likely to be some ""exchange"". None the less, in simple numbers, in March 2017 Welsh prisons had operational capacity for 3,750 people. With a total of 4,787 Welsh prisoners, there were more prisoners than space. No wonder so many were held in England - there was nowhere else to go. Now, with the help of this graph, let's look at what has happened since March and what could happen in the future. By August this year, the operational capacity of Welsh prisons grew to 4,195, mainly due to the opening, in February, of Berwyn prison in north Wales. And if Berwyn were full - it currently holds only a quarter of a possible 2,100 prisoners - that would bring the overall capacity of prisons in Wales up to 5,731. Let's compare that figure with the latest - and only - figure we have for the total number of Welsh prisoners from March 2017 - 4,787. That still means there may be 944 spaces available in Welsh prisons than there are Welsh prisoners. They could be filled by English prisoners. Let's take this one step further. We also know the UK government plans to build a new prison in south Wales - plans which have met resistance from residents, Plaid Cymru and the Howard League for Penal Reform. Baglan, Port Talbot, is a potential site for a new prison in south Wales Both the location and size of the jail are yet to be announced, but it's likely to be built in Port Talbot and I understand it will have space for up to 1,600 prisoners. If that figure is right, there could be 2,544 more spaces available for prisoners in Wales than there are Welsh prisoners. There is some speculation that one of the Victorian prisons in either Cardiff or Swansea could close, and the land sold to developers. Even so, at most this would drop capacity by around 800. The MoJ says all this is speculation. It claims it is investing Â£1.3bn in the ""prison estate"" and Wales could benefit through the creation of ""up to 500 jobs and contributing Â£11m a year to the regional economy."" But by our basic calculations - space available versus Welsh prisoner numbers - it looks like at the moment Wales is not taking an unfair share of the burden when it comes to housing English and Welsh prisoners, but it certainly could be in the future.

"There has been a fair amount of sniggering that the government has announced a freeze in tuition fees - something the Telegraph heralded as part of a ""revolution"". That will matter within the sector. But it is unlikely to change Britain's electoral dynamics. There is, however, one enormous and expensive change that is worth unpicking in all this: Theresa May also told the Telegraph that the government is going to raise the student loan repayment threshold from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000. This has two big effects. First, all graduates earning above the old threshold will now repay less in any given year. A person earning, say, Â£30,000 a year would pay 9% of their income above Â£25,000 - not Â£21,000. So their flow of annual repayments would drop from Â£810 to Â£450. Second, the interest rates charged on the outstanding balance for each student is tied to how far they are above the repayment threshold. As a result, moving this threshold will also reduce the flow of interest accruing to the Treasury that might eventually be payable by ex-students. There are good reasons for doing this. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, has been campaigning for the threshold to rise - it was, after all, promised. And this change reduces the pinch on young people's pay very directly: it feels like a very targeted tax cut to some young graduates. But, to channel the spirit of the Treasury, it is very expensive. Not in the short term, when I'd expect it would make a pretty small impact. But definitely in the longer term. Demonstrations against the interdiction of tuition fees were held in 2010 Back in 2012, when the current student finance system took effect, the Â£21,000 threshold was supposed to rise steadily over time, but it was later frozen in nominal terms to save money. The reason for the freeze was that the loss rate on student loans issued after 2012 was estimated to be around 45p in every pound lent out - higher than originally budgeted for. The freeze cut the cost and, combined with a fewchanges to how the cost is estimated, took the estimate down to about 30p. By eye, I would estimate that this change would increase the cost by at least 10p in the pound. The losses would be over 40p in the pound. That is potentially a lot of money. How much? This affects the so-called ""Plan 2"" debt pile, which stood at Â£44bn in the last debt statistics release. This category is currently accruing at a rate of about Â£13bn a year. So with fees at current levels, it is heading to about Â£120bn at the end of this Parliament. Even with the most conservative assumptions, we are talking well over Â£10bn of losses on the value of that debt by 2022. That loss won't appear in any debt statistics in 2022 - but the losses will be there, and will slowly get added to the national debt between now and the 2050s. It will happen subtly, but this is a ""putting on the Olympics"" level of outlay. The politics of this are baffling, too. The interest charge on outstanding debt - now at 6.1% for higher-earners and students still studying - was a major issue. They could have gone for that without making the whole student finance system a lot more expensive. This measure is a boon for current and recent students - but this looks like progress for Labour. It makes it harder for the government to defend the status quo by making it much dearer.

"Michelle Fox plays Imogene in BBC Three's Overshadowed BBC Three drama Overshadowed is a little different to most TV shows - it's made up entirely of the vlogs of its lead character, Imogene. It's through these videos that her followers begin to notice all is not well in her life. ""I don't think I've seen anything on television like this, I think it's a new kind of concept,"" says Michelle Fox, the actress who plays the teenage central character of Overshadowed. Michelle plays Imogene, a young vlogger who uploads videos every day - recorded in her bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, at school... even while out jogging. But, over the course of eight 10-minute episodes, viewers gradually see her start to show signs of anorexia. ""Basically, Imogene decides to share her life with the world, and the world sees more of her life than she does, with the outside force of the eating disorder,"" Michelle explains. ""It's an insight to Imogene's life and how anorexia is affecting it. ""In the first couple of episodes, she seems like a really normal teenager, and she's lovely, embarrassing, funny, and I think it's not until the end of episode one that you get a snippet that something is not right."" The show's title, Overshadowed, is a reference to Imogene feeling that there's an outside force literally standing over her, compelling her to skip meals and count calories. This external force is presented as an on-screen character - Anna (a reference to anorexia) - who constantly pushes Imogene to eat less and exercise more. ""When someone is going through a mental health crisis or eating disorder, often people blame the person, 'Why can't you just stop? Why can't you see what's going on?'"" Michelle says. ""And by showing the eating disorder as a separate entity, you remove the control, you can see the person trying, but there's this outside control overshadowing them. It's not this person's fault, they're not doing it in a malicious way."" Tackling such a serious subject would be a tall order for any TV show, let alone one which is doing it via a series of vlogs - a relatively new format. ""I think this is a good way to tell a story,"" Michelle says. ""The way I like to watch things as a viewer is I like to be a bit ahead, and be in on the secret, on what's going on. ""But with a vlog, it's blunt, it's instant, people say how they feel, and as an audience member it feels real, like you're right there with the person, especially because they're talking to you directly. ""Imogene is speaking to herself but she's also speaking to a camera, so it puts the viewer in an awkward and horrible position, like the struggle with mental illness is really in your face."" The slightly unusual format was what helped Michelle get the part. The Irish actress graduated from Bristol Old Vic drama school last summer and was appearing in the theatre's production of Medea when she heard about Overshadowed. ""My agent called and she said the casting director wanted to see me, so as well as recording a traditional audition tape, I sent in tapes which I filmed myself on my phone, because I had a feeling the series might all be shot handheld. ""So I sent in two different copies, and the casting director really liked that, and I got cast off the tape [i.e. without meeting the casting director in person], which was really surprising."" Overshadowed is certainly one of the first TV dramas to be told through vlogging, so producers will be watching closely to see how the audience reacts. But Michelle says: ""I think this could be the first of many."" Overshadowed is available to watch now on BBC Three.

"The attack took place outside the train station in the southern French port city Two young women have been stabbed to death at Marseille's main train station in a suspected terrorist attack. Soldiers on guard at the station shot dead the attacker, who police described as of North African appearance and aged about 30. Witnesses said he shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). So-called Islamic State (IS) said the attacker was one of its ""soldiers"". One victim had her throat slit and the other was stabbed in the stomach. They were both aged 20. President Emmanuel Macron said he was disgusted by the ""barbarous act"" and paid tribute to the soldiers and the police officers who responded. The attack took place by a bench outside the southern French city's Saint Charles train station. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told reporters that the attacker had fled after the first murder but returned to kill again. Macron: Anti-terror drive 'top priority' Is terror threat to Europe greater today? Soldiers were already in the station as part of Operation Sentinelle, which sees combat troops patrol streets and protect key sites amid France's ongoing state of emergency. IS claimed it was behind the attack via its Amaq news outlet. The group regularly claims responsibility for militant attacks it believes are inspired by its ideology. ISrecently released a tapepurportedly of leader Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi in which he urged supporters to step up attacks. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Police are treating this as a terrorist attack, but there are plenty of question marks about the man and his motivation. French media report that the killer was in his 20s with a police record for petty offences. If so, that fits in with a steady pattern of recent attacks in France, carried out by individuals who seem to have a deep hatred of French authority, aggravated by exposure to Islamist ideas. 7-9 Jan 2015- Two Islamist gunmen storm the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 17 people.

"This video can not be played Police storm Catalan referendum polling station and take away ballots Catalonia's independence referendum has descended into chaos, with clashes occurring as police attempt to prevent the vote from taking place. The Spanish government has pledged to stop a poll that was declared illegal by the country's constitutional court. Police officers are preventing people from voting, and seizing ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. In the regional capital Barcelona, police used batons and fired rubber bullets during pro-referendum protests. Catalan emergency services said they had treated 38 people who were injured when police pushed back crowds of voters and forced their way into polling stations. The Spanish interior ministry said 11 police officers had been injured. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont condemned the action of the national police and Guardia Civil, who were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote from taking place. ""The unjustified use of violence... by the Spanish state will not stop the will of the Catalan people,"" he told reporters. But Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido blamed Mr Puigdemont for what he termed the day's senseless events. And the Guardia Civiltweeted (in Spanish),externalthat it was ""resisting harassment and provocation"" while carrying out its duties ""in defence of the law"". The ballot papers contain just one question: ""Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?"" There are two boxes: Yes or No. Ahead of the polls opening, the Catalan government said voters could print off their own ballot papers and use any polling station if their designated voting place was shut. This video can not be played Police use batons on a crowd In the town of Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Mr Puigdemont was due to vote. Television footage showed them breaking the glass of the sports centre's entrance door and forcibly removing those attempting to vote. However, Mr Puigdemont was still able to cast his ballot at another polling station. Why these are uncharted waters for Spain Spain's move to halt Catalan vote Since Friday, thousands of separatist supporters had occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. In some areas, farmers positioned tractors on roads and in front of polling station doors, and school gates were taken away to make it harder for the authorities to seal buildings off. Referendum organisers had called for peaceful resistance to any police action. Meanwhile, both FC Barcelona and the Catalan football federation have asked the Spanish football league for tonight's match against Las Palmas to be suspended. Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona It began in the dark and the rain. Daniel, who arrived at his local school at 01:00 and slept in the street outside, said his grandfather would have been proud of him. He and hundreds of others blocked the entrance for several hours before this polling station opened. Suddenly there was silence. Two officers from Catalonia's regional police force had arrived. But a human wall was formed, and the police left. National Spanish riot police arrived at another polling station nearby in Barcelona but again, people there kept them back. One witness said there were scuffles and showed me a photo of a middle-aged woman with a bloody face. But inside the school sports hall, there is a mood of celebration as people take selfies as they cast their votes. Catalonia's former President, Artur MÃ¡s - the man in charge when Catalan nationalists really started pushing for a referendum - told me that people were voting peacefully in the face of ""a violent Spanish state"". Thousands of extra police officers have been sent to the region, many of them based on two ships in the port of Barcelona. The Spanish governmenthas put policing in Catalonia under central controland ordered the regional force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to help enforce the ban on the illegal referendum. In a show of force ahead of the poll, Spanish authorities seized voting materials, imposed fines on top Catalan officials and temporarily detained dozens of politicians. Police have also occupied the regional government's telecommunications centre. Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence - and others don't Pressure for a vote on self-determination has grown over the past five years. But Spanish unionists argue Catalonia already enjoys broad autonomy within Spain, along with other regions like the Basque Country and Galicia. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain's distinctive north-eastern region Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy says the vote goes againstthe constitution,external, which refers to ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards"". Central government spokesman IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo accused the Catalan government of being inflexible and one-sided, but it is a charge that Catalan nationalists throw back at Madrid itself. Demonstrations by independence campaigners have been largely peaceful. On the eve of the vote, thousands of demonstrators calling for Spanish unity held rallies in cities across Spain, including in Barcelona. They waved Spanish flags and carried banners reading ""Catalonia is Spain"". Huge referendum rally in Barcelona Stop escalation in Catalonia - Spain PM Thousands protest over Catalonia raids.

"There were lengthy delays for motorists in the Winchester area A 17-year-old boy has been charged after ""potentially hazardous material"" forced the closure of the M3 motorway. Thousands of people were stuck in queues for 11 hours on 23 September between junctions nine and 11. The teenager, from Winchester, faces two counts of arson with intent to endanger life and two of causing danger to road users, Hampshire Police said. He will appear before Basingstoke magistrates on Monday over incidents on the M3 on 16 and 23 September. The discovery of the partly-ignited substance, dropped from a bridge, led to military bomb disposal experts being called to the motorway near Winchester. The road was closed shortly before 04:00 BST and had fully reopened by about 15:30. At the time of the incident, police revealed they were also investigating a similar case on the same bridge at about 04:00 BST on 16 September, when an object was dropped on to the carriageway. On that occasion officers found ""a quantity of broken glass"" but no fire. No-one was hurt on either occasion.

" Warning: This article contains content that some readers may find distressing The fire at Grenfell Tower in west London on 14 June killed scores of people and left the block a charred ruin. It stands as a reminder of one of the most tragic days in modern British history. Each floor of the tower tells a story - about London and its inhabitants, about immigration and gentrification, about lives lived and tragically lost. It was a microcosm of life in the capital. Like most of Grenfell, the 21st floor housed four two-bedroom flats and two one-bedroom flats arranged around a central hallway, with the lifts on one side and the staircase on the other. We used to play in the hallways because it was pretty big. We’d play football. And ‘it’. We had a nice little group on that floor” Marcio Gomes, former Grenfell Tower resident Marcio and Andreia Gomes, both 38, are originally from Portugal.  Marcio’s parents moved to the UK in search of a better life when he was five. He grew up in west London near Grenfell Tower.  Andreia arrived from Madeira when she was 21, looking for a change of scene. She had come on holiday to England every year with her family. The couple lived with their daughters, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. They’d moved into their council flat 10 years before, but still considered themselves “babies in the tower - a lot of friends had been there 20 years plus”. They loved life in the tower - the amazing views of London and the close-knit community. Marcio Gomes “It was great.  The rooms were big,” says Marcio. “There were kids on every floor, of all different ages. The corridor space in between the flats, even though it was very small, they would play tag, or ride their scooters or play football. We’ve seen a lot of those kids grow up and become young women and men, and move on and get a job.” He works in IT and Andreia is a supervisor in a clothes shop. Seven months pregnant at the time of the fire, she was about to go on maternity leave.  Their son was to be called Logan. They believe that, since the fire, Grenfell has too often been portrayed in a one-dimensional way, as a place full of poor people, living on benefits, but they point out the majority were working. Before the fire, Marcio had done some renovations in preparation for Logan’s arrival, transforming a recessed storage area into a snug nursery. His daughters shared a big bedroom and were making plans to welcome their new brother.  “They were very excited,” says Marcio. “The diversity was great, you’d meet all sorts of different people – Irish, English, Arabic, Muslim, Portuguese, Spanish, Italians. You’d get to see different cultures.  You’d go up in the lift with lots of different people, you’d talk, the kids would play. The tower itself was a community, it was very family orientated.  It’s been portrayed as a poor tower, a broken tower.  It was far from that.” On the night of the fire, the Gomes family had been out for dinner, but had been asleep for several hours when they were woken up by Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya, 12, who lived across the corridor in Flat 186. Helen and Lulya had already tried to get out of the building and had met the El Wahabis from flat 182 on the way. By the time they knocked on the Gomeses' door, it was between 01:30 and 02:00. “[Helen] was panicking a little bit.  I closed the door to stop the smoke.  It was already thick, black smoke,” says Marcio. These two families - the Gomes family of four with Helen, her daughter, Lulya, and two dogs - spent the next two terrifying hours waiting as smoke started to fill the flat. Marcio filled the bath with water and ran the shower.  With all the windows open, the two families stayed low to the ground to try to keep beneath the smoke. All of the adults had conversations with the emergency services and were told to stay put, that firefighters would come to rescue them. They had friends outside the tower who were watching the building burn and were calling them to say they must get out, including Miguel and Fatima Alves who lived on the 13th floor.  They’re also from Portugal and Miguel and Marcio play football together every week. Once the Alves family had escaped from the building, they began to call Marcio to tell him he must get his family out. Tension grew as the fire spread and people became trapped by dense smoke, especially those residents on the top floors of the tower. “I’m very religious and I kneeled down and I begged our lady of Fatima to protect them, to protect everybody in the building, but especially them because they are Portuguese and we knew them,"" says Fatima Alves. Helen was increasingly anxious. “At one point I think I asked one of my friends, ‘Can we speak to the fire people or the police you know?’ And she let me talk to them and we asked them, ‘What shall we do?’ And they say to us, ‘Someone is going to come and take you out,’” says Helen. “That's what they say to us from two to three o'clock. So we've been waiting and waiting and waiting. And then we call again and we asked them. And they said, ‘No, stay in, do not come out. Don't come out, don't come out.’” So the Gomes family and the Gebremeskels waited. At about 03:30, Marcio and Andreia’s bedroom caught fire. “My room is on fire.  Just like that.  My curtains are on fire.  My Moses basket is on fire.  All that side of the window is on fire,” says Marcio. “I looked at them and I said, ‘We have to go now.  There’s no turning back.  It’s now or never.’” Marcio tied wet tea towels around everyone's faces, wrapped wet sheets around them and gave specific instructions about the order in which they should leave.  They began the descent in the pitch black, gagging as they attempted to get down 21 floors of smoke-filled stairs. They found themselves treading on the dead and the dying - other Grenfell residents who, like them, had tried to get out of the building before passing out on the stairs. “We were just going, just going and going, because if we don’t keep going, we’re going to die,” says Helen. Helen, Andreia and Megan, who were at the front, managed to get out.  But when they turned around, Marcio, Luana and Lulya weren’t behind them.  The girls had been overcome by smoke at about the 10th floor and Marcio was desperately trying to find them in the darkness. ""I said, 'I’m here, follow my voice.’ I tried to climb up. She said, ‘I can’t, Dad.’ Then she didn’t talk any more. The smoke was so heavy you couldn’t see.  I kept trying to shout, ‘I’m waiting.’” Marcio saw a light. Two firefighters were on their way upstairs.  They rescued the girls and brought them down to safety. All three children and Andreia Gomes were put into induced comas and treated for cyanide poisoning.  Logan, the Gomeses’ son-to-be, was stillborn in hospital.  It has been difficult to cope with his death - and the deaths of other close friends and neighbours. Andreia Gomes “To me, it’s like yesterday.  Sleeping is horrible.  It’s good to talk about it.  We do that every day,” says Andreia. Marcio is angry that concerns about safety were ignored by the council and the tenants' management organisation before the fire. “Yes, it was an accident, but it could have been avoided.  The residents never wanted cladding, we wanted sprinklers.  We said to them many times it didn’t feel safe after the regeneration work they spent three years doing.  They kept saying, ‘Be quiet, it’s fine.’” But Marcio and Andreia are clear they don’t blame the firefighters for any of what happened. And they are intensely grateful to the two who picked their way through the darkness to rescue Luana and Lulya. The London Fire Brigade rescued 65 people during the fire. Due to ongoing investigations and the public inquiry, it says it cannot go into details of what happened on the night. Now the Gomes family home is just ash.  Detectives showed them a 360-degree view of the flat. “It’s pretty much all gone. The only thing that remained was the metal frames of the beds,” says Marcio.  “There’s a huge crack in the floor.  The fire must have been so intense in that area.  It was difficult for me and my wife to see, but it was important, to close that chapter in the book.” Both the dogs that the Gomeses and Gebremeskels tried to rescue died - after the girls passed out, both dogs ran back to their flats. As for the material possessions they have lost, though everything is gone, it’s the sentimental things “you can’t put a price on” that are missed. “The first thing I thought of was the nursery books my daughters had done, and pictures of course,” says Andreia. “I had photos of my mum who passed away.  The negatives were there, but we lost them as well.” Three months on from the fire, the family are still living in a hotel. They’ve only been shown one potential new flat in all that time and the strain is beginning to show. Marcio believes they can rebuild their lives. “We have to for the sake of the girls,” says Andreia. But they are haunted by what happened and by the fine line between death and survival. “I am not sleeping too well at the moment and that’s because all those things keep running through my head,” says Marcio. But his actions on the night were key to their escape.  He was calm and organised, filling the bath, wetting towels, giving clear instructions to the others about how they might make it out of the building.  Six of the seven people who escaped from the 21st floor that night did so under his guidance. Helen Gebremeskel Born in Ethiopia, Helen Gebremeskel, 45, came to the UK as a political asylum seeker when she was a child.  She moved into Grenfell Tower 20 years ago. For 17 years she lived in a one-bedroom council flat and then in 2014 she moved down a floor, to the two-bed council flat on the 21st floor she shared with her daughter Lulya – Flat 186. “It was a very special building, Grenfell Tower, very special,” says Helen. Lulya misses the flat. “Like when I walk through, I open the door and I hear my dog bark.  And then I miss my friends that I would play with.” Lulya: “I miss my friends” Helen’s flat was painstakingly decorated - a haven of white with a few splashes of purple in the form of cushions and carpet. She was proud of the home she’d created with its corner sofa in the living room, its large television and its designed feel. “It was very nice.  Whoever comes in that house is shocked.  It was a beautiful house.  The living room was very big.  And the kitchen, it’s very big.  I have never seen a council flat that big.” Off the entrance corridor, Helen had created a prayer room - a quiet place for someone with a hectic working life. Every day Helen went to the beauty salon she ran in west London. “I’m always working, I always go home late.  The only day I have a day off is Sunday which is to spend time with my daughter.” Helen was always close to her neighbours, the Gomes family. Lulya often spent time with their daughters. The night of the fire began like many other evenings for the family in Grenfell.  Lulya had a shower and watched a movie while Helen cooked their dinner.  They ate together and then went to bed.  But Helen was woken just before 01:30 by her fire alarm and immediately smelled smoke.  When she looked out of her kitchen window, she could see the fire. She woke Lulya, who grabbed their dog, and they tried to go down the staircase. That attempt failed but ultimately they were to be successful. Helen talks wistfully of the community she’s lost. “It’s my home. I know a lot of the people there, my neighbours, and everyone there.   When you live somewhere for 20 years, it’s your home. It’s very difficult for us.” As well as her neighbours on the 21st floor, her best friends in the tower were the Choucair family - Nadia Choucair, her husband Bassem and their three children, Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab who was three.  They lived on the 22nd floor and were her neighbours for 17 years. Helen spoke to them a lot on the night of the fire as they sheltered in their flat one floor up. “The last time I called them and I say to them, ‘You need to get out, you need to get out.  No-one’s coming to rescue us, you need to get out.’ I explained to them, ‘Just cover them with a wet towel, just wet it and just get out.’ I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for Marcio. Her husband Bassem was crying.  He was crying and that was the last time I spoke to them.” Helen is devastated by their loss. “It’s very emotional, thinking you’ve got friends there who support you, is always there with you, you know. And then, all of a sudden, they’re not there.” Flat 182 was the home of NHS worker Abdulaziz El Wahabi, 52, and charity volunteer Faouzia El Wahabi, 42. They lived with their children Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 15, and Mehdi, eight. Abdulaziz worked long hours as a hospital porter. He was dedicated, with a great sense of fun, says his brother-in-law Chris Jones. “You have to have a sense of humour to work in the NHS.  He never complained, he got on with the job.  Being a porter, you’re someone who goes to the operating theatre, to X-rays.  It’s a very important job - you just don’t get well paid for it.” Abdulaziz at work in University College Hospital Faouzia volunteered at the Westway Trust, teaching people to knit and crochet. She was also an involved parent at her youngest son’s school. “His mum always came on our visits. She’d accompany the class.  The children got to know her very well.  She had a wonderful smile.  She was a lovely lady,” says Sara Cooper, head teacher at the Oxford Gardens primary school. Originally from the harbour town of Larache in northern Morocco, Abdulaziz moved to the UK when he was nine.  His father, who was also a hospital porter, came on a visit to London and liked it so much, he stayed and got a job.  Soon after, he brought his family over to live with him.  His son, Abdulaziz, had two brothers and six sisters who all live in Britain. Abdulaziz and Faouzia had three children, all born in the UK. The family moved to Grenfell  shortly after the birth of their oldest son Yasin, 20 years ago. “That flat was their home.  It was like they took Morocco and it was in the flat,” says Chris Jones. Flat 182 was full of Moroccan artefacts including carpets and ceramics gathered on the family’s trips back to north Africa. There were Moroccan paintings on the walls and mirrors with Moroccan frames. There was even a miniature electrically operated water fountain with ceramic tiles. “Abdulaziz loved plants,” says sister Hanan Wahabi, who lived in another part of the tower. “He had a range of plants and he took pride in how much they would grow. “Abdulaziz and Faouzia were both proud of their children and liked having their photos displayed showing the progression of how they had grown.” The couple had just finished redecorating their bedroom. They changed the flooring from carpet to laminate wood and bought new cupboards and drawers from Ikea which the older two children helped to put together. The oldest child, Yasin, was studying accountancy part-time at Greenwich University.  He’d also completed a course as a referee at football tournaments, worked in Subway and helped one of his uncles on his stall in Portobello market selling Moroccan rugs. “Yasin was a grafter.  He had lots of friends.  Everybody loved Yasin,” says Chris. Yasin on holiday in Morocco Nur Huda, their only daughter, was described by her teachers at Holland Park School as a “warm and good-spirited 15-year-old”. She loved playing football. Nur Huda had finished some of her GCSEs just before the fire. Her aunt, Hanan, picked up the results when they came.  Nur Huda got an A in additional science and Bs in core science, history, PE, maths, English language and literature. “Her parents would have been proud of her,” says Hanan. Nur Huda was taking her GCSEs in June Eight-year-old Mehdi was in year three at Oxford Gardens Primary School.  A keen judo fan, his friends made a collage to describe him.  It included the words “funny”, “loving”, “warm”, “beautiful person”. Mehdi, dressed for World Book Day The El Wahabis, the Gomes family say, were at the heart of the 21st floor community.   The children were in and out of each other’s homes and the adults often knocked on each other’s doors for a chat or to borrow something when they’d run out.  Faouzia’s generosity stands out. “I remember one Christmas, she came to knock on our door, with this huge chicken.  She said, ‘This is for you, it’s Christmas,’” says Andreia Gomes. On the night of the fire, the El Wahabis ate together as a family.  It was Ramadan and Yasin went to the mosque to perform the specific prayer that follows the fast.  He then went out with some cousins and friends to an American diner in west London before returning home.  Abdulaziz and the rest of the family stayed and prayed in their flat.  Nur Huda was revising for her GCSE exams. Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya saw the El Wahabis at about 01:30 as they all tried to escape the building.  But as they attempted to go downstairs, they were turned back by other Grenfell residents who were coming up the staircase. “People were telling us to go back up.  Because the firefighters had told them to go back up, to go to the top,” says Lulya. Relatives of the El Wahabis spoke to them by phone that night. Abdulaziz’s sister Hanan lived with her family on the ninth floor.  She escaped from the building at about 01:20 and then spoke to her brother at 01:25.  He said he was going to try and get out with his family.  They spoke again at about 01:30 and Abdulaziz told her they hadn’t been able to get out because it was pitch black and they were struggling to breathe outside the flat. When Hanan called again, the family said they’d been told by the emergency services to stay put and await rescue.  Another sister spoke to Faouzia El Wahabi at about 02:00.  Faouzia told her that the emergency services had advised the family to move into the bedroom and put towels under the door. Chris Jones and his wife also spoke to Abdulaziz that night. “He said, ‘There’s a lot of smoke, we’re not leaving.’  After that, that was it.  We tried ringing and ringing, but there was no answer,” says Chris. “I’ve thought a few times about being put in the position where you’ve made a decision for the family around you.  The last thing you would do is what we call the Shahada [prayer]. They would have got comfort out of that.” The surviving relatives have endured a long wait to find the remains of their loved ones.  All five members of the family - Abdulaziz, Faouzia, Yasin, Nur Huda and Mehdi - have now been identified in the flat.  Relatives received the news about Nur Huda only in the middle of September. The tragedy of the family’s demise has rippled out into the community. Head teacher Sara Cooper had to break the news to Mehdi’s class. “It was incredibly hard.  There was lots of sobbing, but I think it was important because they were ready – they were at the point where they could cry, because of all the amazing work their teachers had done. We all cried together.” A week after the fire, University College Hospital paid tribute to its missing porter.  The chief executive, Marcel Levi, said: “Abdulaziz is an extremely dedicated and hugely popular member of staff.  He is a larger than life character who never fails to show kindness and compassion to patients and colleagues.” Chris Jones is still trying to deal with what has happened. “If there was a good way to die, it would be among people who loved you and cared for you and would do anything on this earth to be with you.” “I can’t believe we won’t see them any more,” says Andreia Gomes. “The youngest one used to come and knock on our door every Sunday to play with our youngest. She used to go there as well to have dinner with them.  We used to see them every day, if not one of the children then the mum or dad.  I think I’m still just expecting to bump into one of them in the road.” Only 14 flats in Grenfell Tower were not in council hands - two were owned by housing associations and 12 had private owners. One of those was on the 21st floor. Flat 185 had been bought from the council in 2000 under right- to-buy rules by its tenant, Nigerian-born Tunde Adoweru. He had moved out a few years before and begun to rent out his property. The listing on the rental website described “a fabulous, bright two-bedroom flat, with panoramic views of London landmarks - 77 square metres in size, includes a contemporary fully fitted kitchen and open plan living room, two double bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, limestone bathroom and separate toilet.” Management consultant Julian Ng, 30, and IT platforms engineer Lee Stewart, 29, both British-born, had moved in 11 days before the fire. Their rent was more than £400 a week.  But the flat’s spacious rooms, chrome kitchen and surround sound stereo system immediately attracted them. “When you stepped into the flat itself, it was beautiful, tasteful, modern and because it was on the 21st floor, it had amazing views,” says Julian. “How do you describe London?  It’s very diverse.  And that’s what we got from this place.  It was a very nice place to live in.” Lee also liked the building. “It’s been painted as a very, kind of, poverty-stricken building.  Maybe parts of it were.  But that’s not the impression we had when viewing it.” The couple had started to plan for dinner parties. “We had a huge glass dining table, loads of windows.  You could take advantage of the views from so high up,” says Lee. They had a lucky escape on the night of the fire.  It was Lee’s birthday.  Julian was away for work and had invited his partner to spend the night in his hotel. They heard about the fire when their landlord called them at about 03:00. They watched the blaze on TV, horrified by what was happening and wondering about their new neighbours. “My last morning in there, I was late for work, it was 8.55.  The lifts took a really long time to get down - they were stopping at most floors and kids were piling in, going to the school just outside.  There were so many families and children in there.  You have a hazy memory of who you’ve seen, knowing not all of them will be OK,” says Lee. Julian and Lee have had moments of overwhelming sadness. “There’s a huge sense of loss,” says Lee. “It was my first night away from the flat.  I should have been home.  If I had been, when would I have heard?  Would I have been able to get out?  Would I have got messages to my family?  I keep thinking about the ‘what ifs’.  We were very lucky.” The couple have lost all their possessions and, like the Gomes family, it’s the more personal belongings that matter. “I had a stupid plant I carried around for 10 years,” says Lee. “It had a name, it is really daft. I’m terrible at gardening and can’t keep anything alive.  But this plant lived for 10 years.  It’s just stuff like that that’s irreplaceable.” Julian lost old photos from university and childhood.  “One of the things Lee liked was a T-shirt I had.  That’s lost.  OK, I can replace it, but not that specific T-shirt. [Or] the cuddly toy you had for 10 years.” Ligaya Moore’s friend, Nenita Bungay In one of the one-bedroom flats lived Ligaya Moore, who came to Britain from the Philippines about 45 years ago. Her friend Nenita Bungay says Ligaya had always dreamed of living in the UK. She came to work as a nanny and later was a waitress, and had married a British man, James Moore.  He died of cancer a decade ago and Ligaya, by then retired, continued to live in their council flat.  She was a keen ballroom dancer back in the day. A photo of Ligaya's wedding “She was an active person, she loved to dance, even at her age.  That’s why she loved our church because she loved dancing,” says Pastor Emil from the Jesus is Lord Church. Ligaya was well known to her neighbours on the 21st floor. “She was always sweet after school, because sometimes I’d come home by myself.  I’d see her in the lift and she would always offer me a sweet,” says Lulya. “She was lovely, she always played with the kids.  She was 80, something like that I think, and she used to use the stairs for exercise!  It was amazing.  From the 21st floor to the ground is a lot of steps,” says Marcio Gomes. On the night of the fire, none of the surviving neighbours saw Ligaya at all. Nenita was the last person to see her. “We had a wonderful dinner that night.  She peeled avocado.  We had a wonderful salad.  I brought some porridge.  She brought chocolate.  She was so happy.” After the meal, they went their separate ways at about 22:30.  Nenita got a call that night from another friend to say Ligaya’s building was on fire. “I call her every minute, no answer,” says Nenita. Nenita Bungay hopes her friend died peacefully in her sleep “I am thinking she was in a deep sleep, maybe in a deep sleep and being suffocated with fire and smoke.” The police showed Nenita footage of Ligaya’s burnt- out flat. “The ceiling, the walls, everything is rubble… everything is collapsed. The bed is only coils, the fridge is only a skeleton.” Forensic teams have located human remains inside Ligaya’s flat.  They haven’t yet been identified as hers. Very sadly, on 14 June, rescue never came for Ligaya Moore, or the El Wahabis in flat 182. Their neighbours will never forget them. “We used to see them every day,” says Andreia Gomes. “I can’t believe I won’t see them any more.” The occupant of Flat 184, who escaped the fire, chose not to take part in this report. Apart from the permanent residents, there have been reports of a woman from the Philippines, illegally in Britain, who claimed to live on the 21st floor. On contacting her, she said she was homeless and had spent time between two flats in Grenfell Tower - sometimes staying on the 21st floor but not on the night of the fire. She chose not to take part in this report. Built with Shorthand",Negative,4.3891164e-06

"This video can not be played Police storm Catalan referendum polling station and take away ballots Catalonia's independence referendum has descended into chaos, with clashes occurring as police attempt to prevent the vote from taking place. The Spanish government has pledged to stop a poll that was declared illegal by the country's constitutional court. Police officers are preventing people from voting, and seizing ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. In the regional capital Barcelona, police used batons and fired rubber bullets during pro-referendum protests. Catalan emergency services said they had treated 38 people who were injured when police pushed back crowds of voters and forced their way into polling stations. The Spanish interior ministry said 11 police officers had been injured. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont condemned the action of the national police and Guardia Civil, who were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote from taking place. ""The unjustified use of violence... by the Spanish state will not stop the will of the Catalan people,"" he told reporters. But Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido blamed Mr Puigdemont for what he termed the day's senseless events. And the Guardia Civiltweeted (in Spanish),externalthat it was ""resisting harassment and provocation"" while carrying out its duties ""in defence of the law"". The ballot papers contain just one question: ""Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?"" There are two boxes: Yes or No. Ahead of the polls opening, the Catalan government said voters could print off their own ballot papers and use any polling station if their designated voting place was shut. This video can not be played Police use batons on a crowd In the town of Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Mr Puigdemont was due to vote. Television footage showed them breaking the glass of the sports centre's entrance door and forcibly removing those attempting to vote. However, Mr Puigdemont was still able to cast his ballot at another polling station. Why these are uncharted waters for Spain Spain's move to halt Catalan vote Since Friday, thousands of separatist supporters had occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. In some areas, farmers positioned tractors on roads and in front of polling station doors, and school gates were taken away to make it harder for the authorities to seal buildings off. Referendum organisers had called for peaceful resistance to any police action. Meanwhile, both FC Barcelona and the Catalan football federation have asked the Spanish football league for tonight's match against Las Palmas to be suspended. Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona It began in the dark and the rain. Daniel, who arrived at his local school at 01:00 and slept in the street outside, said his grandfather would have been proud of him. He and hundreds of others blocked the entrance for several hours before this polling station opened. Suddenly there was silence. Two officers from Catalonia's regional police force had arrived. But a human wall was formed, and the police left. National Spanish riot police arrived at another polling station nearby in Barcelona but again, people there kept them back. One witness said there were scuffles and showed me a photo of a middle-aged woman with a bloody face. But inside the school sports hall, there is a mood of celebration as people take selfies as they cast their votes. Catalonia's former President, Artur MÃ¡s - the man in charge when Catalan nationalists really started pushing for a referendum - told me that people were voting peacefully in the face of ""a violent Spanish state"". Thousands of extra police officers have been sent to the region, many of them based on two ships in the port of Barcelona. The Spanish governmenthas put policing in Catalonia under central controland ordered the regional force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, to help enforce the ban on the illegal referendum. In a show of force ahead of the poll, Spanish authorities seized voting materials, imposed fines on top Catalan officials and temporarily detained dozens of politicians. Police have also occupied the regional government's telecommunications centre. Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. This video can not be played Why some Catalans want independence - and others don't Pressure for a vote on self-determination has grown over the past five years. But Spanish unionists argue Catalonia already enjoys broad autonomy within Spain, along with other regions like the Basque Country and Galicia. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain's distinctive north-eastern region Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy says the vote goes againstthe constitution,external, which refers to ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards"". Central government spokesman IÃ±igo Mendez de Vigo accused the Catalan government of being inflexible and one-sided, but it is a charge that Catalan nationalists throw back at Madrid itself. Demonstrations by independence campaigners have been largely peaceful. On the eve of the vote, thousands of demonstrators calling for Spanish unity held rallies in cities across Spain, including in Barcelona. They waved Spanish flags and carried banners reading ""Catalonia is Spain"". Huge referendum rally in Barcelona Stop escalation in Catalonia - Spain PM Thousands protest over Catalonia raids.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says the government ""has to look again"" at the issue of tuition fees Theresa May has admitted a change in her party's approach on tuition fees in England, saying she has listened to voters and fees will freeze at Â£9,250. Fee repayment thresholds will also rise, so graduates will start paying back loans once they earn Â£25,000, rather than Â£21,000, the PM said. She said the whole student finance system would be reviewed and did not rule out a move to a graduate tax. Labour, which wants to scrap tuition fees, called the plan ""desperate"". The prime minister, who is in Manchester for her party's conference,also pledged to extend the Help to Buy schemewhich helps people buy newly-built homes, in an attempt to win over younger voters. The Olympic cost of PM's tuition fees plan 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees 'I worry about money most of the time' How to own a home by the age of 25 Tories 'urgently need more volunteers' Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she plans to apologise to Conservative activists for her decision to call a snap election. She said the message she had taken from the election, at which she lost her Commons majority, was that the Conservatives needed to ""listen to voters,"" particularly younger people and those who are ""just about managing"". She said that when the government increased student fees it had been expected that there would be a ""diversity in the system,"" with some universities offering shorter and cheaper courses, rather than always charging the maximum amount. ""That hasn't happened. We've got to look at it again,"" she told Marr. Asked if there could be a graduate tax instead of the current system, she said: ""By looking at it again we will be looking at the issues that people are raising, we will be looking at where the system has worked, we will be looking at the concerns that people have."" The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday The planned Â£250 increase in tuition fees for 2018-19 to Â£9,500 will not go ahead and fees will instead remain at the current maximum of Â£9,250 per year. The overhaul of the higher education sector could also see the introduction of fast-track, two-year degree courses, an idea which has been suggested to limit the costs for young people considering higher education. Other ideas being considered by the government as part of the overhaul are cutting the interest rates on loans and introducing lower fees for students studying certain subjects, such as engineering, where there is a skills shortage. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said he wanted to see the government going further by  reintroducing maintenance grants for the poorest students and reducing interest rates for low and medium earners. ""We also need to do more to reverse the worrying decline in the numbers of part-time and mature students,"" he added. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust education think tank, agreed that maintenance grants should be reintroduced and also called for fees to be means-tested so those from low-income families repay less. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the move was ""a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass because they have no plans for young people and no ideas for our country"". She added: ""They are yesterday's party."" By Sean Coughlan, BBC education correspondent Calling this a ""freeze"" on tuition fees in England is a distinctly positive spin on abandoning a policy of increasing fees above Â£9,250 only put in place this year. If not a U-turn, it's certainly a Uni-turn. But it shows how quickly the politics have changed - with rising fees and ballooning debts now a toxic combination for any party wanting to court young voters. Although billed as a change of direction, universities had already predicted thata fee rise was ""dead in the water""because, without a majority, the government had no realistic prospect of pushing it through. Perhaps more significant is the increase in the earnings threshold for repayments - up from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000. There is also the promise of re-examining interest rates for loans, hiked to 6.1% from this autumn. But this will be the first time an announced fee rise has had to be ditched. The question will be whether cancelling an increase will be a bold enough move compared with promises to scrap them altogether. Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, welcomed the move, saying increasing the repayment threshold from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000 could save many lower and middle earning graduates thousands of pounds. Writing on his Facebook page,external, he said ""every single graduate earning over Â£21,000 a year will pay less"". ""And it has a long-term progressive benefit too,"" he added. ""As most graduates won't clear their loans in full before it's wiped - by reducing what they repay each year, you reduce what they repay in total too."" However, he said details were still ""sketchy"" and it was unclear who it would apply to. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme is currently only available on newly-built homes in England The Help to Buy expansion will see Â£10bn go to another 135,000 buyers in order to help them to own their own home. The funding will allow recipients to get a mortgage with a deposit of just 5%. The money can only be put towards the purchase of new-build homes. The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday - when Mrs May will be the final speaker in Manchester. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent in Manchester The conference slogan isn't ""anything but Brexit"", but listen to what the party's high command wants to talk about here in the next few days, and it might as well be. There is a clear attempt by senior Conservatives here to change the subject; stray beyond the ever present - and divisive - topic of leaving the European Union, and flesh out the government's domestic political priorities. Ministers want to be seen to be addressing an Achilles heel for them at the general election - young people, who overwhelmingly rejected them in June. Hence two policies pitched directly at them: university tuition fees in England, and getting on the property ladder. The political reality, though, is Brexit - the defining political issue of our time - will never be far from the lips of people here. And neither too will the precarious state of the party and its leader, after the humiliation of going backwards in an election Theresa May called voluntarily.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says the government ""has to look again"" at the issue of tuition fees Theresa May has admitted a change in her party's approach on tuition fees in England, saying she has listened to voters and fees will freeze at Â£9,250. Fee repayment thresholds will also rise, so graduates will start paying back loans once they earn Â£25,000, rather than Â£21,000, the PM said. She said the whole student finance system would be reviewed and did not rule out a move to a graduate tax. Labour, which wants to scrap tuition fees, called the plan ""desperate"". The prime minister, who is in Manchester for her party's conference,also pledged to extend the Help to Buy schemewhich helps people buy newly-built homes, in an attempt to win over younger voters. The Olympic cost of PM's tuition fees plan 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees 'I worry about money most of the time' How to own a home by the age of 25 Tories 'urgently need more volunteers' Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show she plans to apologise to Conservative activists for her decision to call a snap election. She said the message she had taken from the election, at which she lost her Commons majority, was that the Conservatives needed to ""listen to voters,"" particularly younger people and those who are ""just about managing"". She said that when the government increased student fees it had been expected that there would be a ""diversity in the system,"" with some universities offering shorter and cheaper courses, rather than always charging the maximum amount. ""That hasn't happened. We've got to look at it again,"" she told Marr. Asked if there could be a graduate tax instead of the current system, she said: ""By looking at it again we will be looking at the issues that people are raising, we will be looking at where the system has worked, we will be looking at the concerns that people have."" The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday The planned Â£250 increase in tuition fees for 2018-19 to Â£9,500 will not go ahead and fees will instead remain at the current maximum of Â£9,250 per year. The overhaul of the higher education sector could also see the introduction of fast-track, two-year degree courses, an idea which has been suggested to limit the costs for young people considering higher education. Other ideas being considered by the government as part of the overhaul are cutting the interest rates on loans and introducing lower fees for students studying certain subjects, such as engineering, where there is a skills shortage. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said he wanted to see the government going further by  reintroducing maintenance grants for the poorest students and reducing interest rates for low and medium earners. ""We also need to do more to reverse the worrying decline in the numbers of part-time and mature students,"" he added. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust education think tank, agreed that maintenance grants should be reintroduced and also called for fees to be means-tested so those from low-income families repay less. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the move was ""a desperate attempt by the Tories to kick the issue into the long grass because they have no plans for young people and no ideas for our country"". She added: ""They are yesterday's party."" By Sean Coughlan, BBC education correspondent Calling this a ""freeze"" on tuition fees in England is a distinctly positive spin on abandoning a policy of increasing fees above Â£9,250 only put in place this year. If not a U-turn, it's certainly a Uni-turn. But it shows how quickly the politics have changed - with rising fees and ballooning debts now a toxic combination for any party wanting to court young voters. Although billed as a change of direction, universities had already predicted thata fee rise was ""dead in the water""because, without a majority, the government had no realistic prospect of pushing it through. Perhaps more significant is the increase in the earnings threshold for repayments - up from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000. There is also the promise of re-examining interest rates for loans, hiked to 6.1% from this autumn. But this will be the first time an announced fee rise has had to be ditched. The question will be whether cancelling an increase will be a bold enough move compared with promises to scrap them altogether. Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, welcomed the move, saying increasing the repayment threshold from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000 could save many lower and middle earning graduates thousands of pounds. Writing on his Facebook page,external, he said ""every single graduate earning over Â£21,000 a year will pay less"". ""And it has a long-term progressive benefit too,"" he added. ""As most graduates won't clear their loans in full before it's wiped - by reducing what they repay each year, you reduce what they repay in total too."" However, he said details were still ""sketchy"" and it was unclear who it would apply to. The Help to Buy mortgage scheme is currently only available on newly-built homes in England The Help to Buy expansion will see Â£10bn go to another 135,000 buyers in order to help them to own their own home. The funding will allow recipients to get a mortgage with a deposit of just 5%. The money can only be put towards the purchase of new-build homes. The Conservative Party conference runs from Sunday until Wednesday - when Mrs May will be the final speaker in Manchester. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent in Manchester The conference slogan isn't ""anything but Brexit"", but listen to what the party's high command wants to talk about here in the next few days, and it might as well be. There is a clear attempt by senior Conservatives here to change the subject; stray beyond the ever present - and divisive - topic of leaving the European Union, and flesh out the government's domestic political priorities. Ministers want to be seen to be addressing an Achilles heel for them at the general election - young people, who overwhelmingly rejected them in June. Hence two policies pitched directly at them: university tuition fees in England, and getting on the property ladder. The political reality, though, is Brexit - the defining political issue of our time - will never be far from the lips of people here. And neither too will the precarious state of the party and its leader, after the humiliation of going backwards in an election Theresa May called voluntarily.

"This video can not be played Ruth Davidson says Corbyn ""hasn't even won a raffle"" Ruth Davidson has demanded Scotland benefits more from being part of the Union with a plea for more government jobs to be relocated north. The Scottish Conservative leader said the UK ""continues to be far too London-centric"" with ""enough civil servants to fill Wembley Stadium"". Ms Davidson also urged activists not to lose heart in the face of a resurgent Labour Party. She predicted Jeremy Corbyn's ""bubble"" would burst if the party worked hard. Guide: 2017 political party conferences The Scottish Conservatives have enjoyed a significant revival under Ms Davidson's leadership, winning 13 seats in June's snap election, including those of former first minister Alex Salmond and SNP depute leader Angus Robertson. She told the Conservative conference in Manchester: ""Just as the SNP came crashing down to earth. Just as they lost 40% of their seats in June. ""Just as half a million Scots chose to take their vote away. So too can the Corbyn bubble burst, but only if we work hard to make it so. ""Because, you know what? People tire of being offered free unicorns. Of easy promises that don't add up. ""They want serious solutions to the issues facing their world. They want opportunities to make their own lives better."" The Scottish Conservatives leader said she loved London but - in an allusion to speculation she could be a future prime minister - joked: ""No plans to move there myself, but great to visit."" But she then criticised the concentration of civil servant jobs in the UK capital, saying: ""For all the devolution of power in the last 20 years, our Union continues to be far too London-centric."" Ms Davidson praised the V&A Dundee project but argued more jobs must move outside London She told the conference: ""We live in a country where the property values of London's top 10 boroughs are worth more than all of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales combined. ""Where you can sell a three bed semi in Ilford, and buy half of Sutherland. ""Where, in a capital city already zooming forward on the jet fuel of high finance, the economy is further boosted by enough civil servants to fill Wembley stadium."" Ms Davidson cited the new V&A museum in Dundee as a model of investment already taking place. She argued that the civil service and cultural bodies must ""represent and be present"" across the whole of the UK. ""The government is reviewing the various agencies based in London to see which ones could be ready for a move,"" Ms Davidson said. ""So I want us to seize the opportunity to ensure more of them come to Scotland."" The SNP described Ms Davidson's call for a transfer of civil service jobs ""lightweight"". MSP Joan McAlpine said: ""Given the nature of Ruth Davidson's speech this afternoon, we now expect her to stand up to Theresa May and get behind our efforts to bring more powers to Holyrood after Brexit. ""David Mundell previously promised a powers 'bonanza' for Scotland so let's see some progress made on that promise with real action."" She added: ""Scotland needs more than just the relocation of some civil service departments - we need full powers in areas such as immigration and social security in order to make a real, positive difference to people's lives.""
