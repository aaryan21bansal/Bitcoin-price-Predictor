"Universities and colleges are facing a wave of cyber-attacks Universities and colleges are being warned by the UK's cyber-security agency that rising numbers of cyber-attacks are threatening to disrupt the start of term. The National Cyber Security Centre has issued an alert after a recent spike in attacks on educational institutions. These have been ""ransomware"" incidents which block access to computer systems. Paul Chichester, the NCSC's director of operations, says such attacks are ""reprehensible"". The return to school, college and university, already facing problems with Covid-19, now faces an increased risk from cyber-attacks, which the security agency says could ""de-rail their preparations for the new term"". The cyber-security body, part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, says attacks can have a ""devastating impact"" and take weeks or months to put right. Newcastle University and Northumbria have both been targeted by cyber-attacks this month, and a group of further education colleges in Yorkshire and a higher education college in Lancashire faced attacks last month. Newcastle University faces cyber-attack Northumbria University hit by cyber-attack UK universities in Blackbaud attack Leeds college group under cyber-attack Hackers beat university cyber-defences in two hours Students blamed for college cyber-attacks The warning from the NCSC follows a spate of ransomware attacks against academic institutions - in which malicious software or ""malware"" is used to lock out users from their own computer systems, paralysing online services, websites and phone networks. The security agency says this is often followed by a ransom note demanding payment for the recovery of this frozen or stolen data - sometimes with the added threat of publicly releasing sensitive information. Newcastle University faced a cyber-attack this month Universities have frequently been targets of cyber-attacks - with up to a thousand attacks per year in the UK. Attacks can be attempts to obtain valuable research information that is commercially and politically sensitive. Universities also hold much personal data about students, staff and, in some cases, former students who might have made donations. Earlier this summermore than 20 universities and charities in the UK, US and Canada were caught up in a ransomware cyber-attackinvolving a cloud computing supplier, Blackbaud. A Freedom of Information inquiry in July, carried out by the TopLine Comms digital public relations company, found 35 UK universities, out of 105 responses, had faced ransomware attacks over the past decade. There were 25 which had not had attacks - and a further 43 which declined to answer. One university reported 42 separate ransomware attacks since 2013. The warning from the NCSC highlights the vulnerability of online systems for remote working, as increased numbers of staff are working from home. ""Phishing"" attacks, where people are tricked into clicking on a malicious link such as in an email, also remains a common pathway for such ransomware attempts, says the advice. Mr Chichester of the NCSC says: ""The criminal targeting of the education sector, particularly at such a challenging time, is utterly reprehensible."" ""I would strongly urge all academic institutions to take heed of our alert."" Universities UK says data security has had to become a priority for higher education - and that ""protections are in place to manage threats as much as possible"". The universities body also says it is working with the NCSC to produce ""robust guidance on cyber-security"" which will be released later this academic year.

"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething announced the lockdown during a press conference A second county in Wales will go into lockdown because of the rate of coronavirus cases. The 240,000 people living in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) will have restrictions imposed on their daily lives. From 18:00 BST on Thursday, people will not be able to enter or leave the area without a reasonable excuse, such as travel for work or education. All licensed pubs, bars and restaurants will have to shut by 23:00 every day, once the lockdown comes into effect. People will also be banned from meeting people outside their own households indoors. What can I do in Rhondda and Caerphilly lockdown? Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there had been a ""rapid"" rise in cases, with 82.1 infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days. The latest equivalent figure across the whole of Wales is 21.4 per 100,000. It is the second local lockdown in Wales, after Caerphilly county borough was made subject to restrictions last week. A trip to Doncaster was said to be associated with one of the clusters of cases in RCT. A statement on Wednesday evening from the Welsh Government clarified the party did not attend the races being held in the South Yorkshire town,as part of a pilot event for 2,500 people.

Testing centres have been opened in the county borough Wednesday's rate of positive tests for the past week in RCT was 5.1% - the highest in Wales. Mr Gething previously warned a positive rate of 4% across Waleswould trigger a national lockdown. The Wales average is 2.4%. Figures on Wednesday showed RCT's case rate had almost caught up with Caerphilly, which had 83.4 per 100,000 people over the past seven days. The lockdown restrictions have been imposed despite people in RCT having been asked to takeextra precautions last week. A review into the lockdown will be held in two weeks' time. Contact tracing teams have been able to trace about half of the coronavirus cases in RCT ""back to a series of clusters within the borough"", Mr Gething told a press conference. ""The rest are evidence of community transmission."" One cluster is associated with a rugby club and a pub in the lower Rhondda valley, another is connected to a club outing to Doncaster, which Mr Gething said stopped off at a series of pubs on the way. ""My message is that is absolutely the wrong thing to do,"" said the health minister. ""Somebody in that party should have recognised they were acting outside the rules and they were a significant risk to themselves and their families at home. ""This wasn't a group of young people - it's entirely possible for people in their 40s and 50s to behave irresponsibly, and we've seen a significant spread from that event. ""So think about the choices you're making and about how you, your family and community would want to be kept safe."" Doncaster Racecourse has confirmed it had no ticket bookings for any groups from south Wales for the event. ""Doncaster Racecourse has received no contact from any organisation, including the NHS or the Welsh Government, to verify the attendance of any individuals at last week's event for the purposes of track and trace,"" it said. Under the lockdown rules, no-one will be able to leave or enter the county without a reasonable excuse. The list of excuses to travel is the sameas in Caerphilly, including: For essentials - food and medicine For work, if you cannot work from home, or for education To obtain supplies for the essential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation or to get access to public services Motorists will be able to drive through the county borough, providing they do not stop. The rules can be enforced by a system of fixed penalty notices, which start at Â£60 to a maximum of Â£1,920, or unlimited fines in the courts. People had been asked to take precautions last week in RCT as cases rose ""It's really scary,"" says florist Joy Carter Joy Carter owns the florist Flowers By Joy in Aberdare town centre. She described the local lockdown as a ""nightmare again"". ""It's crazy. Last time it was so difficult. I don't understand how I can go into a pub but not a house. ""I'm doing flowers for a wedding this Saturday - what will they do? It's been so difficult with the weddings and funerals."" She said the town had been busy all day, but added: ""What's it going to be like tomorrow? ""As for trade, people are going to be too afraid to go out again, especially older people. A few have said they had better stay in. ""It's really scary."" She said she will stay open ""even if I put the shutters down and just take orders over the phone"". ""I don't think anyone can be blamed. I think it's going to be around for a long time,"" she said. Barber Sirwan Hussein says people are not wearing masks in the town Barber Sirwan Hussein said it was clear there was problems with people respecting covid rules. ""I think people don't care about social distancing,"" he said. ""I've been around everywhere, and not many people are wearing a mask. ""The UK is going to be locked down again - we'll all be in lockdown again."" He said he had a client who did not want to wear a mask, even though it is now the law indoors in Wales. ""He said if they want to fine me - fine me - I'll pay the fine, but I'm not going to wear a mask."" Butcher David Bishop hopes a new lockdown will bring a boost for local businesses Aberdare butcher David Bishop said he did not believe the new rules in RCT would not have a major impact. ""Everything is going to be open as normal, it just affects the daily lives of families meeting together,"" said the 54-year-old. He said there could be a silver lining for businesses such as his. ""We were open right through the original lockdown, and in real terms it actually got busier for us,"" he said. ""Now it's back to normal levels - maybe this will make us busier again."" Rules allowing people to meet six people from their extended household in Wales will also not apply in RCT. Mr Gething said residents will be able to meet outdoors ""for the time being"". University of South Wales students will still be able to travel in and out of RCT for their studies, despite the new restrictions. Speaking in the Senedd, Mr Gething said: ""It would be permissible for people to move into that area and to stay there for their study."" He said students would need to observe the local restrictions while they were there."" Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""Now we need to stick to the rules and get the transmission rate down to protect the NHS and the most vulnerable."" Leanne Wood, Plaid Cymru Rhondda Member of the Senedd (MS), said it was ""disappointing, but not a surprise"". ""The sooner we get this under control, the sooner we can ease restrictions and the safer our loved ones will be,"" she added. Pontypridd Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones said: ""I know the news of tighter coronavirus restrictions will be worrying for people across Ponty, but I am confident that this is the right approach in order to reduce the number of cases locally."" The Rhondda Cynon Taf area is home to 240,000 people The difference in rules around pubs in RCT and Caerphilly prompted questions from the Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies. ""The health minister must explain the rationale behind this and give guidance across Wales to prevent other lockdowns."" Mr Gething told his press conference that pubs were a ""factor in transmission"" in RCT, but had not been in Caerphilly. He said a series of bars and pubs have faced closures and improvement notices in the area. A bar has been shut in Pontypridd after a series of breaches were captured on CCTV, a licensed premise was closed in Tonypandy and improvement notices for another bar in Pontypridd and a barbers in Tonypandy were also issued. A further 50 licensed premises were visited by council officers over the weekend, Mr Gething said. Asked why he was not closing all pubs, Mr Gething said: ""If there are no opportunities to drink in licenced premises we may see more people breaking the rules and drinking in each other's homes."" Ystrad councillor Elyn Stephens told theLocal Democracy Reporting Serviceshe welcomed the decision to impose fresh restrictions, however she said some concerns remained over pubs. ""There are questions to be answered about why the lockdown wasn't localised to the known clusters, in the lower Rhondda, a fortnight ago when they first became apparent. ""The response I've received so far to the announcement has been overwhelming anger and frustration that the pubs are still open, when residents cannot see their families.""

"This video can not be played Asked if the EU is negotiating a trade deal with the UK in good faith, Boris Johnson says: âI donât believe they areâ. No 10 has reached a deal with some of the Tory MPs unhappy with plans to give the government the power to override parts of the UK's Brexit agreement. Boris Johnson has agreed to amend the Internal Market Bill, giving MPs a vote before he could use the powers in it that would break international law. The move could head off a potential rebellion over the issue next week. But Labour said the UK was on course to break its word, as a senior government legal officer quit over the issue. Lord Keen, Scotland's Advocate General,stood downon Wednesday after days of speculation about his future. In his resignation letter, he told the PM: ""I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a Law Officer with your policy intentions."" Kuenssberg: No 10 not backing down Law officer offers resignation over Brexit bill How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? The peer, who served in the Ministry of Justice, objected to proposed legislation which would allow the government to override parts of the EU withdrawal agreement, in contravention of international law. But less than a hour after his exit was confirmed, Downing Street said it had reached a compromise with two critics of sections of the bill, ex-justice minister Sir Bob Neill and former work and pensions secretary Damian Green. Agovernment amendment,externalto the bill, published on Thursday, would prevent ministers from activating powers in the bill to override the Brexit divorce deal until MPs had voted to approve it first. The provision is similar to the changes to the bill proposed by Sir Bob, who will now drop his planned amendment. Ministers have also tabled amendments to place a time-limit on attempts to question the legality of controversial sections of the bill via judicial review. Tonight's compromise - some would say U-turn - between Downing Street and potential Conservative rebels appears to have solved one short-term problem. It staves off the prospect of a serious, if not fatal, show of high-profile dissent next week when MPs debate the specific clauses of the bill that would breach international law. The ""parliamentary lock"" would allow MPs as a whole, and not just ministers, to decide whether to press the political equivalent of the nuclear button. It is thought MPs may be less likely to do so. But this compromise won't be enough to stop the bill being potentially savaged in the Lords. Eminent peers with a background in the legal profession maintain that it is still wrong to legislate with the intention of breaking international law. They will be bolstered by Lord Keen's resignation - as he has made it clear that he couldn't reconcile his responsibilities as a law officer with the government's policy. And Brussels is insisting that the clauses which override part of the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland should be removed entirely. Otherwise the EU could take the UK government to court. In a joint statement with No 10, Mr Green - head of a centrist group of Tory MPs - said: ""The Internal Market Bill was designed to give MPs and peers a vote on the use of these powers via statutory instrument. ""But following talks, it is agreed that the Parliamentary procedure suggested by some colleagues provides a clearer, more explicit democratic mandate for the use of these powers, and also provides more legal certainty."" The statement claims that on the Tory benches there is ""near-unanimous agreement that the government must be able to use these powers as a final resort, that there must be legal certainty, and that no further amendments are required on these powers"". Mr Green urged the government to focus on settling the terms of its future economic partnership with the bloc before the 15 October deadline set by the PM. Allow Twitter content?

Senior Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale, who hadthreatenedto vote against the bill unless it was changed, welcomed the government's plans to amend it. In a tweet on Thursday, he wrote: ""Good that Bob Neill's amendment, which I endorsed, has effectively been accepted. ""At least Parliament will now have the chance to vote again if the government proposes to change the withdrawal agreement."" The bill has provoked a backlash from the EU, which has threatened legal action - and the possible suspension of trade talks - if the measures overriding the withdrawal agreement are not withdrawn. And Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said his party would continue opposing the legislation. Responding to the joint statement on Wednesday he said: ""This does not fix the problem of breaking the law, damaging our reputation around the world and damaging our future prosperity. ""We need a trade deal with Europe and that is what we were promised. Breaking our own word and the treaty the prime minister signed puts that at risk."" Defending the bill on Wednesday during an appearance before a committee of senior MPs, Mr Johnson said he believed the EU may not be negotiating with the UK in good faith over the agreement's implementation. Pressed by Labour's Hilary Benn on whether he thought the EU was negotiating in good faith, he said: ""I don't believe they are."" This contradicted Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who earlier told MPs he believed the EU was acting in good faith. When that was put to him, Mr Johnson said it was ""always possible that I am mistaken and perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong"". Both sides have a duty to act in good faith under Article 5 of the withdrawal agreement - but it is difficult to demonstrate a lack of ""good faith"" or ""best endeavours"" - another phrase enshrined in the treaty. The legal definition of ""good faith"" is stronger than the generally accepted meaning of the words. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards.

So his comments about the Good Friday Agreement should come as no surprise. Indeed they largely echo concerns expressed by senior Democrat politicians in Congress to British ministers about the impact Brexit may have on the peace process. The only difference is Joe Biden may soon be elected President of the United States - still the most powerful country in the world. On Tuesday, four senior congressmen also issued a similar warning, saying a UK-US trade deal would be blocked if the UK failed to preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement. The letter was signed by Democratic congressmen Eliot Engel, Richard Neal, and Bill Keating, who all chair committees in the US House of Representatives, as well as Republican Congressman Peter King. How could the Brexit deal change? What is the Northern Ireland protocol PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons However, asked about the bill at a joint UK-US press conference Mr Pompeo said: ""We trust the UK, we know the complexities of the situation, I have great confidence they will get this right."" Mr Raab said ""the threat to the Good Friday Agreement comes from the EU's politicisation of the issue"". He defended the bill as ""precautionary and proportionate"" adding ""what we can't have is the EU seeking to erect a border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain"". Asked earlier about the letter from US politicians, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think when they understand what we are trying to do they will share our ambition and concern which is to protect the peace process."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, said the ""rhetoric coming from Washington is growing increasingly ridiculous"". He said if a post-Brexit trade deal were allowed to lead to new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, this would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement. ""Do unionist voices not matter in [Washington ] DC, or is it just about the Irish-American vote rather than peace in Belfast?,"" he added. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 By BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack This is not the first time that Brexit and the peace accord's paths have crossed. During negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,some claimed a hard borderbetween NI and the Republic of Ireland would breach the Good Friday Agreement. But critics of that argument point out thatthe text does not contain an explicit commitment,externalnever to harden the border, and there is nothing about customs posts or regulatory controls. The only place in which it alludes to infrastructure at the border is in the section on security, which cites ""the removal of security installations"". Unionists say the real breach of the deal is the NI Protocol, which instead places an economic border in the Irish Sea. They claim it breaks the Good Friday Agreement, as it does not have the consent of both communities. What this latest argument is really about is whether the government's new Brexit plans for Northern Ireland breach the ""spirit"" of the peace deal. That in itself is open to interpretation - but is widely understood to be a spirit of non-violence, consent and partnership. That's what has prompted the intervention from several prominent US politicians, and debate over this is likely to deepen as Brexit talks move towards a conclusion. In his talks on Wednesday, Mr Raab argued that the government's plans are precautionary and proportionate - and in response to what ministers describe as threats from the EU to block food imports. Mr Raab also met Mr Pompeo, amid continuing transatlantic tensions over Iran. The US secretary of state recently accused the UK and its European allies of ""siding with the Ayatollahs"" for blocking further United Nations sanctions on Iran. What just happened with Brexit?

"Ex-Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has landed a Â£100,000 job advising the owner of some of the UK's top ports. The Conservative MP is working for Hutchison Ports, which operates Harwich and Felixstowe among other terminals. According to the MPs' register of financial interests,external, he will be paid for seven hours work a week for a year. The appointment has been approved by a Whitehall watchdog despite it raising concerns of a ""perceived risk"" that it may give the firm an unfair advantage. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments,external(ACOBA) said Mr Grayling had reassured them he would not be advising the company on its commercial maritime activities or risks and opportunities associated with Brexit. The watchdog said the role would be limited to advising the firm, which also operates London Thamesport, on its environmental strategy and its engagement with local enterprise bodies. It said the MP must comply with these and other conditions, including a ban on him lobbying ministers on behalf of the company or giving advice on UK government tenders, until July 2021, two years after he left the cabinet. Mr Grayling stepped down as transport secretary when Boris Johnson became PM in July 2019, having served under his predecessor Theresa May for three years. MPs are allowed to take on second jobs - and while some have argued that representing constituents should be a full-time occupation, others say working in ""the real world"" keeps members of Parliament grounded in reality. For ex-members of the government, however, taking on paid work is slightly trickier - particularly if they have only recently given up their ministerial red boxes. There are rules on appointments set by the government, with compliance overseen by ACOBA. Former ministers and ex-senior civil servants are are expected to seek advice from the watchdog and follow its advice if they want to start a job less than two years after leaving government. However although the watchdog has the power to put information about appointments into the public domain, it has no formal enforcement powers. In 2017, a committee of MPs described ACOBA as ""a toothless regulator"". And in the same year, Labour's then shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said it was ""populated with establishment figures"". Why has Javid been allowed to work for JP Morgan? Critics of Mr Grayling say he made a series of poor decisions during his time in the job, including awarding a contract to a group of ferry operators to provide extra capacity after the UK left the EU - one of which had never sailed a vessel. The contracts,which Mr Grayling described as an insurance policy, were later cancelled. The National Audit Office estimated that the costs incurred to the taxpayer could be as high as Â£56.6m. Mr Johnson sought to install the MP for Epsom and Ewell as chair of the powerful Commons Intelligence and Security Committee in July. But MPs on the committee voted to back his colleague Julian Lewis instead. Mr Grayling has since quit the committee.

After being sacked as chancellor, the Conservative accepted several roles including as an advisor to the BlackRock Investment Institute and the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper.

"Sony has matched the price of the forthcoming flagship PlayStation 5 to that of Microsoft's Xbox Series X. Last time round, the PS4 significantly undercut the Xbox One at launch. Sony also confirmed the PS5's ""digital edition"" - which does not have a disc drive - would cost about 40% more than the low-end Xbox Series S. Both PS5 consoles are set to be released on 19 November in the UK, and 12 November in the US, Japan and Australia. That puts them slightly later than Microsoft's 10 November launch date. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be one of the PS5's exclusive titles Sony was the clear leader in the previous generation of the so-called console wars. The various PlayStation 4 consoles outsold the Xbox One range by a factor of more than two to one. But the Â£449/$500/â¬500 cost of the Japanese firm's new top-end machine and Â£360/$400/â¬400 price of the digital edition means it may be a closer battle this time, at least to begin with. Some industry-watchers believe Microsoft's combination of a Â£250 price for the XBox Series S and the value offered by the Xbox Game Pass subscription service could give the US firm an advantage. Microsoft offers members its first-party blockbuster games at launch in its games library, unlike Sony's existing PlayStation Now services, which is limited to older major releases. Sony's decision to price some of its first PS5 releases at Â£70 - including the ""ultimate edition"" of a new Spider-Man game, and Demon's Souls - represents a rise, and will also have to be taken into consideration. It showed off a new subscription service called the PlayStation Plus Collection for the PS5. PS5 owners will be able to play the PS4's God of War and are being promised a sequel of their own But it appeared to focus on the PS4's greatest hits - including Last of Us Remastered, God of War and Bloodborne - rather than any of the PS5's forthcoming releases. ""Microsoft has a really appealing offering with the Xbox Series S pricing at just Â£250, and Sony doesn't really have an answer to that for people who just want the cheapest possible entry point to next-generation gaming,"" video games journalist Laura Dale told the BBC. ""However, people who want to play any of Sony's first-party franchises are unlikely to be swayed to Xbox just because it's cheaper."" One key difference between the two companies' strategies is that the Xbox Series S delivers lower-resolution graphics than the Series X because it has less powerful components, while Sony has opted only to remove the Blu-ray drive from its entry-level machine. On that basis, its marketers may still argue it provides a better-value way to experience the full power of what next-generation games can deliver. The trailer for the new Final Fantasy game said it would only be released on the PS5 and PCs Even so, it is likely Sony will instead focus its appeal on the draw of its ""console exclusive"" titles. To that end, during its latest virtual event it showed trailers and gameplay for: Final Fantasy XVI - the latest entry in Square Enix's series, which appears to be set in a medieval world this time round after the sci-fi-themed last title Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales - including a lengthy battle with super-villain The Tinkerer on a bridge. A version of this game will also be released for the PS4 Deathloop - an assassin-themed shooter in which time repeats, helping players learn how best to hunt their targets Sony also teased its forthcoming God of War sequel Ragnarok, which it said would be released next year, but only showed off an animated logo. ""It is possible that PS5 will have launched three console-exclusive titles before Xbox Series X manages to launch its first - Halo Infinite, with no date in 2021 specified as of yet,"" said Louise Shorthouse, a games analyst at Omdia. ""Consumers also tend to stick with the same console brands across generations, so Sony is in an incredibly strong position."" Many of the games on show had been previewed at an earlier event in June. Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world game set more than 100 years before Harry Potter was born But there was also a first look at the much anticipated Harry Potter spin-off Hogwarts Legacy. The role-playing game will be a cross-platform release in 2021. Facebook boosts power and cuts price of Oculus Quest VR headset Xbox blinks first by pricing Xbox Series X ahead of PS5 Marvel's Avengers: Gaming can be 'more personal' than movies ""The two higher-spec consoles are close to each other in terms of specification - the Xbox has more storage, but the PS5's is slightly faster,"" said Nicky Danino, a gaming expert at the University of Central Lancashire. ""But there are still reasons why people will pick a specific console. What platform your friends play on, for example, is highly influential."" It looks like Sony is almost trolling arch-rival Microsoft by matching the PS5's price to that of the Xbox Series X. The gambit will have surprised many industry observers. Xbox felt forced to reveal its prices last week following a leak. And this seemed to gift PlayStation a second-mover advantage. But when I spoke to PlayStation's chief executive Jim Ryan, he was adamant that the PS5's price points had been set since the beginning of the year. Likewise, he said, today's announcement had been in his diary for some time. On paper the Xbox Series X is the more powerful machine. But PlayStation has a solid line-up of platform-exclusive titles. And the delay to Halo Infinite - after fans complained that footage shown earlier in the year was underwhelming - has been a big blow to Microsoft's original launch plans. But is the PS5 fighting the last generation's console war? Xbox has a compelling offer with its Game Pass Ultimate subscription service. So even if Xbox doesn't sell as many physical consoles as PlayStation, it may still prove to be at least as profitable. When I questioned Mr Ryan about the possibility of a similar service, he said PlayStation was about big blockbuster games that cost a lot to make, so a similar subscription service model would not make financial sense. We will find out whether he sticks to that strategy in 2021 or beyond once supply meets demand.

"Test centres in Bolton have seen long queues as people try to get tested More than 100 people turned up at an A&E asking for Covid-19 tests, sparking a plea from a hospital trust for anyone who was not seriously ill to stay away. Bolton NHS Trust said dozens of people went to Royal Bolton Hospital because they could not get into test centres. The trust says it shows NHS Test and Trace is ""failing"" but the government insists it is ""working"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and firefighters could soon be used as contact tracers. It would provide more ""rigour"" to the national system, he said. Bolton had the highest infection rate in England with 204 cases per 100,000 people recorded in the week to 13 September. The total number of cases rose from 437 up until 6 September to 587 a week later. The government said people who were not eligible were requesting tests The trust's medical director Dr Francis Andrews, said people should only go to hospital if they were ""extremely unwell or referred by your GP"". ""We are extremely busy in our emergency department as a result of this increase,"" he said. ""Only attend this department if you have experienced a life-threatening accident or illness and need urgent medical attention."" Meanwhile, Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan made a similar plea to stay away from A&E. ""We are receiving a high volume of patients coming to A&E requesting a COVID-19 test,"" it said in a post on its Facebook page. And Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has urged parents not to bring children to its emergency department for a Covid-19 test after a ""big increase"" in people asking for tests there. Bolton NHS Trust Chairwoman Prof Donna Hall said the government's approach was ""failing"". Prof Hall said the situation now was different to the one in March when they had extra staff drafted in and were not expected to continue with planned operations. ""This failure of the test-and-trace system is placing huge pressure on the NHS and social care,"" she said. ""We had 100 people in our accident and emergency unit. ""We've now got 30 people who are Covid-positive and we've got five people in our high-dependency unit so this virus is not going away. She said she felt there had been a lack of a cohesive strategy for both the containment of the virus and for the test and trace system. Lancashire's director of public health said the system was at ""breaking point"" and was ""compromising our ability to stop the transmission"". Teacher Simon Foster says the testing system was an ""absolute mess"" Teacher Simon Foster said he developed a cough overnight and, because of his job teaching children with special needs - many of whom have diabetes - he needs to be tested . ""I have tried all day to book an appointment and I still don't have one,"" he said. ""It's an absolute mess."" ""It keeps saying there was nothing available [and] there were no tests they could send by post either."" ""I hope it is just a cough.... I can't go back to work until I get tested."" Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said it was ""beyond frustrating"", adding: ""The issue is lab capacity. ""We have our own community testing sites and were doing about 200 tests a day - [on Tuesday] we did 1,639 tests. We can't go on like this."" Bolton Council said a test centre had been due to open on Saturday at the Last Drop Village Hotel, in response to the growing number of cases, but was delayed when ""an external business"" failed to turn up. A spokesman said although the delay had been ""out of our hands"", the authority was ""working with the government and their partners to find out what has happened"". Mr Burnham said 46% of named contacts were not being traced in Greater Manchester. He said 100 police community support officers (PCSOs) and 100 fire officers would set up a unit to help contact people not being reached. ""It can't be the case going forwards that we fail to fix test, trace and isolate and just introduce blanket restrictions. I don't think people will accept that,"" he said. ""We think more rigour in contact tracing, quality contact with people and support to self isolate would help improve the system."" Powers to bring in ""targeted"" restrictions, like changing a specific pub or supermarket's opening hours, were also being sought, Deputy Mayor Bev Hughes added. Steve Rumbelow, the chief executive at nearby Rochdale Council,Â told theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicethere had been a ""noticeable change"" in people's behaviour across Greater Manchester and the testing system was in ""meltdown"". He said it was ""largely"" because people were unable to get tested. ""It's not massive numbers, I don't want to over-egg it, but [it] indicates that people are starting to get concerned,"" he said. ""Test and trace is pretty much in meltdown. ""It's a major concern, and the way tests are being rationed is just not sustainable for containing the virus effectively going forward."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said NHS Test and Trace was ""working"", adding the system was ""processing a million tests a week, but we are seeing significant demand for tests, including from people who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible"". He said anyone with an appointment would not be turned away, and new booking slots and home testing kits were being made available daily.

Over two million people have waited over 18 weeks for surgery, the highest number since records began in 2007. In July, NHS trusts in England were told they should get back to about 80% of last year's levels of in-patient procedures by the end of September. Coronavirus: Long waits for hospital operations soar in England Coronavirus: Major disruption to cancer care revealed Cataracts are cloudy patches on the lens that cause loss of sight. And surgery to replace the affected lens with an artificial one is the most commonly performed operation in the UK. It usually takes about 20-40 minutes under local anaesthetic. And Moorfields aims to have patients in and out within 90 minutes. One of more than 100 patients being operated on at the specialist hospital in a single day, Brenda Silverman, 77, had to isolate for three days, and take a coronavirus test, before her surgery could go ahead. Before the operation, she said: ""I haven't been seeing so well. ""The glare and the blinding at night is awful."" And afterwards, she said: ""Everything is in focus. ""There's nothing I can't see. ""Everything is bright and cheerful."" Cataract service director Vincenzo Maurino said Moorfields had had to rethink ""almost everything to make this possible"". ""Doing four times more what we were doing will ensure our waiting list, which has gone up to four months, will come down significantly,"" he said. ""Also, we don't know what the future has ahead so we want to learn from this experience, repeat it or find other ways or be adaptable."" The ""cataract drive"" will use eight operating theatres, including those at Moorfields's private facility. And 80 St John Ambulance volunteers will assist with pre-operative assessments and accompanying patients. An NHS official said: ""Elective surgery has already rebounded from around a third of its usual rate during the peak of Covid to well over two-thirds in August, with further increases since then. ""Staff are working hard to ensure that clinics, diagnostic facilities and theatres are as safe as possible. ""So if you or a loved one have worrying symptoms, please don't put off seeing your GP. ""And if you're then asked to attend a hospital appointment, please do."" TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected? COVID-19 AND FOOD:How has lockdown changed what we eat?

"A second national lockdown would be likely to have ""disastrous"" financial consequences for the UK, the prime minister has said. Appearing at a committee of MPs, Boris Johnson said the government was doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent another nationwide lockdown. This was why new restrictions - such as the ""rule of six"" - were necessary to ""defeat"" the disease, he said. The PM also admitted there was not enough testing capacity. Earlier,he blamed a ""colossal spike"" in demandfor ongoing problems in accessing tests and results being delayed. On Wednesday, coronavirus cases in the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219,according to figures from the government.,external A further 20 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This brings the UK death total by this criterion to 41,684. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts Amid the increase in coronavirus cases, Mr Johnson was asked by the Commons Liaison Committee whether the UK could afford another national lockdown. Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want a second national lockdown - I think it would be completely wrong for this country and we are going to do everything in our power to prevent it. ""And can we afford it? I very much doubt that the financial consequences would be anything but disastrous, but we have to make sure that we defeat the disease by the means that we have set out. ""So when I see people arguing against the rule of six or saying that the government is coming in too hard on individual liberties and so on - I totally understand that and I sympathise with that, but we must, must defeat this disease."" From Monday,new rules came into force, restricting indoor and outdoor gatherings in England and Scotland, and indoor groups in Wales. A second national lockdown is extremely unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, it is hugely damaging - to the economy, to education and to wider health for reasons other than Covid. You only need to look at the latest figures for falling cancer referrals, the hours spent out of school and the rising unemployment to see the cost of the UK's spring lockdown. Secondly, the government and its medical advisers have a much better grasp of the virus. Current infection rates and hospitalisations remain much lower than they were in the spring and, despite the problems with testing, there is pretty rich data on exactly where the virus is and how quickly it is spreading. Even if things get worse, officials are quite confident the NHS will cope. But that does not mean there won't be further restrictions - or that it won't be a very difficult winter with a high number of deaths. The ban of gatherings of more than six people could be just the first step. There is also talk of curfews, forcing hospitality venues to close at 22:00 BST. This tactic was used in Belgium to curb the rise in cases, and has been deployed to tackle the outbreak in Bolton. At this stage, it is unlikely this will be used nationally. Instead, expect it to be an option for virus hotspots, along with banning visits to other people's housing which has been used in the North West and West Yorkshire. Shielding could, though, be re-introduced across the country at some point, along with bans on visits to care homes, in an attempt to protect the most vulnerable groups. Mr Johnson also admitted there was not enough coronavirus testing capacity amid reports of people struggling to get tests and results being delayed. He told the committee: ""We don't have enough testing capacity now because, in an ideal world, I would like to test absolutely everybody that wants a test immediately."" He promised there would be capacity for 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. But he urged people without symptoms to stay away from testing centres - although he acknowledged why they may want to find out if they had Covid-19. ""What has happened is demand has massively accelerated just in the last couple of weeks,"" he said. Earlier, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who stood in for Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, said Mr Johnson had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing, but ""then breaks those promises"". ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises,"" she said. This video can not be played Angela Rayner stood in for Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions MPs at the liaison committee also asked the prime minister about his aim of having a ""pregnancy-style test"" in place within months, which would have a role in fulfilling his""Operation Moonshot""ambition for mass testing. The government has said it Â£500m has been set aside to invest in its mass testing plans. Mr Johnson said: ""I am going to be cautious and say that I can't sit here today and say that we have such a 'pregnancy-style test'... today. ""It is right for government to invest in such a project."" YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Committee chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin told Mr Johnson musicians, singers and performers had ""fallen through the cracks of the support schemes available"". Mr Johnson said the best way to help the sector was to ""get these businesses going again and to get the theatres lit again, by having the virus down and having a testing regime that allows us to do that"". He also said an inquiry into the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic would ""look at everything that has gone wrong and gone right"". But he said it would not be a ""good use of official time at the moment"" and declined to indicate when the inquiry could begin. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland saidplans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days,. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Mr Buckland said. Resolving delays with testing was ""the number one issue"", he added.

"People requiring A&E will be urged to book an appointment through NHS 111 under a trial in parts of England. The aim is to direct patients to the most clinically-appropriate service and to help reduce pressure on emergency departments as staff battle winter pressures, such as coronavirus and flu. The pilots are live in Cornwall, Portsmouth, Hampshire and Blackpool and have just begun in Warrington. If they are successful, they could be rolled out to all trusts in December. However, people with a life-threatening condition should still call 999. Under the new changes, patients will still be able to seek help at A&E without an appointment, but officials say they are likely to end up waiting longer than those who have gone through 111. More NHS 111 call handlers are being brought in to take on the additional workload, alongside extra clinicians, the Department of Health and Social Care said. A campaign called Help Us Help You will launch later in the year to urge people to use the new service. The government has also pledged an extra Â£150m of funding to expand and upgrade 25 more A&Es to reduce overcrowding and improve infection control ahead of winter. This was in addition to theÂ£300m announcedfor a number of trusts to upgrade their facilities, it said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""During the peak of the pandemic we saw millions of people using NHS 111 to get the best possible advice on Covid-19, and other urgent NHS services. ""These pilots will build on this and test whether we can deliver quicker access to the right care, provide a better service for the public and ensure our dedicated NHS staff aren't overwhelmed."" A&E visits in England down to record low People told to phone ahead before going to A&E Hospital plea after 100 go to A&E for virus test This trial scheme, which seems likely to be adopted at hospitals across England, will see big changes to what people are familiar with at A&E. People who are not seriously ill will be actively discouraged from arriving at emergency departments without an appointment. They won't be turned away, but they have been warned there could be even longer waits than before. On the other hand, those who have called NHS 111 first and been directed to A&E will get a confirmed time to see an appropriate clinician. They could just as easily be directed to an urgent treatment centre or a mental health professional. There's the understandable aim of cutting unnecessary visits, so reducing overcrowding in waiting areas at a time when hospitals want to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission. But for the plan to work, a big public information campaign is required and people will need to have confidence they can get through quickly to an NHS 111 call handler when they need to. Data from the Department for Health and Social Care suggests there are 14.4 million A&E attendances in England that have not gone through NHS 111, a GP or via an ambulance. It said 2.1 million attendances do not result in admission or treatment. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts will welcome the funding, as it will ""enable them to provide better care for their patients this winter"", adding that the 111 proposals were the ""right approach"". Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the 111 scheme could have advantages for many older people, including avoiding waiting in crowded A&Es. ""However, it is important to stress that older people who have difficulty using the phone will not be turned away if they go straight to A&E as before,"" she said. YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? The government also announced a consultation on new targets for waiting times in A&E is being launched as ministers prepare to scrap the current four-hour target. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""Expansion of NHS 111 will help patients to be seen more quickly by the service most appropriate to their needs. ""We are pleased to have reached the consultation phase of how A&E performance is measured with a focus on the safe, timely care of the very sickest patients, and look forward to the publication of the proposals.""

"Test centres in Bolton have seen long queues as people try to get tested More than 100 people turned up at an A&E asking for Covid-19 tests, sparking a plea from a hospital trust for anyone who was not seriously ill to stay away. Bolton NHS Trust said dozens of people went to Royal Bolton Hospital because they could not get into test centres. The trust says it shows NHS Test and Trace is ""failing"" but the government insists it is ""working"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and firefighters could soon be used as contact tracers. It would provide more ""rigour"" to the national system, he said. Bolton had the highest infection rate in England with 204 cases per 100,000 people recorded in the week to 13 September. The total number of cases rose from 437 up until 6 September to 587 a week later. The government said people who were not eligible were requesting tests The trust's medical director Dr Francis Andrews, said people should only go to hospital if they were ""extremely unwell or referred by your GP"". ""We are extremely busy in our emergency department as a result of this increase,"" he said. ""Only attend this department if you have experienced a life-threatening accident or illness and need urgent medical attention."" Meanwhile, Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan made a similar plea to stay away from A&E. ""We are receiving a high volume of patients coming to A&E requesting a COVID-19 test,"" it said in a post on its Facebook page. And Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has urged parents not to bring children to its emergency department for a Covid-19 test after a ""big increase"" in people asking for tests there. Bolton NHS Trust Chairwoman Prof Donna Hall said the government's approach was ""failing"". Prof Hall said the situation now was different to the one in March when they had extra staff drafted in and were not expected to continue with planned operations. ""This failure of the test-and-trace system is placing huge pressure on the NHS and social care,"" she said. ""We had 100 people in our accident and emergency unit. ""We've now got 30 people who are Covid-positive and we've got five people in our high-dependency unit so this virus is not going away. She said she felt there had been a lack of a cohesive strategy for both the containment of the virus and for the test and trace system. Lancashire's director of public health said the system was at ""breaking point"" and was ""compromising our ability to stop the transmission"". Teacher Simon Foster says the testing system was an ""absolute mess"" Teacher Simon Foster said he developed a cough overnight and, because of his job teaching children with special needs - many of whom have diabetes - he needs to be tested . ""I have tried all day to book an appointment and I still don't have one,"" he said. ""It's an absolute mess."" ""It keeps saying there was nothing available [and] there were no tests they could send by post either."" ""I hope it is just a cough.... I can't go back to work until I get tested."" Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said it was ""beyond frustrating"", adding: ""The issue is lab capacity. ""We have our own community testing sites and were doing about 200 tests a day - [on Tuesday] we did 1,639 tests. We can't go on like this."" Bolton Council said a test centre had been due to open on Saturday at the Last Drop Village Hotel, in response to the growing number of cases, but was delayed when ""an external business"" failed to turn up. A spokesman said although the delay had been ""out of our hands"", the authority was ""working with the government and their partners to find out what has happened"". Mr Burnham said 46% of named contacts were not being traced in Greater Manchester. He said 100 police community support officers (PCSOs) and 100 fire officers would set up a unit to help contact people not being reached. ""It can't be the case going forwards that we fail to fix test, trace and isolate and just introduce blanket restrictions. I don't think people will accept that,"" he said. ""We think more rigour in contact tracing, quality contact with people and support to self isolate would help improve the system."" Powers to bring in ""targeted"" restrictions, like changing a specific pub or supermarket's opening hours, were also being sought, Deputy Mayor Bev Hughes added. Steve Rumbelow, the chief executive at nearby Rochdale Council,Â told theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicethere had been a ""noticeable change"" in people's behaviour across Greater Manchester and the testing system was in ""meltdown"". He said it was ""largely"" because people were unable to get tested. ""It's not massive numbers, I don't want to over-egg it, but [it] indicates that people are starting to get concerned,"" he said. ""Test and trace is pretty much in meltdown. ""It's a major concern, and the way tests are being rationed is just not sustainable for containing the virus effectively going forward."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said NHS Test and Trace was ""working"", adding the system was ""processing a million tests a week, but we are seeing significant demand for tests, including from people who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible"". He said anyone with an appointment would not be turned away, and new booking slots and home testing kits were being made available daily.

"A significant drop in the number of child sexual abuse cases reported to police during lockdown masks the true extent of what's happened to vulnerable children, police chiefs say. National Police Chiefs Council data shows reports in England and Wales fell by 25% between April and August, compared with the same period in 2019. But officers told BBC Newsnight this does not represent the true picture. And senior officers are warning child protection referrals will now rise. Chief Constable Simon Bailey said he suspected the 25% fall was ""a false and misleading picture"" of what children may have experienced during those months. 'Worryingly low number' of at-risk children in school Online child abuse rising during lockdown Child sex abuse charity sees 50% rise in referrals ""Those children that would have been exposed to those adverse experiences during lockdown, it is only going to emerge when they spend time within the safe environment of a school, in contact with their teachers, who are very, very good and adept at identifying those signs - the indicators that something is not right within that child's life,"" he said. Supt Chris Truscott, of South Wales Police, agreed there were limited opportunities during lockdown for vulnerable children to disclose harmful behaviour, which would start to come to light only now schools were back. He too expected an increase in referrals officers would have had no way of identifying during lockdown. ""If they were vulnerable before the pandemic, then the likelihood is that vulnerability will have increased over that period of time,"" Supt Truscott said. ""So I think what we are likely to see is that trickle effect turning more into a river type effect where all of that six months of lockdown experiences which children perhaps have been through [are] aired."" 'My parents put me in dangerous situations' Thousands of police trained to spot childhood trauma Help for trauma in childhood 'fragmented' Supt Truscott is the national police lead onEarly Action Together,external, a multi-agency programme in Wales that aims to stop those with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) - such as living with domestic abuse, divorce, a parent with addictions or in prison, and physical or sexual abuse - entering the criminal justice system. Those who have ACEs are: 14 times more likely to be victims of violence 15 times more likely to commit violence against another person 20 times more likely to be jailed as adults At Pencoed Comprehensive, in Bridgend, assistant head teacher Rob Green said staff training in how pupils' behaviour could indicate traumatic experiences outside school had helped vulnerable children progress. Exclusions are down by almost 60% and attendance has risen. But Mr Greene added: ""Because of what has happened and the changes families have had, maybe losing jobs, some families that now have to make do and go without because of the economic climate we are in, the pressure within the family will increase. ""So I do think we will have a lot more support we will need to put in place and we will be supporting our pupils as best we can."" In England, meanwhile, those responsible for child protection are concerned there is not yet the same integrated approach. Mr Bailey, who heads the Norfolk force, said England had ""some work to do"" putting in place the right joined-up policy. ""It needs to be the golden core that is woven through the fabric of everything that we do, be it in the police service, be it in the Ministry of Justice, be it in the Department for Education, the Department for Health,"" he said. ""We all have a responsibility to ensure that future generations of children have the opportunity to succeed and to thrive. ""And if we get this right, and the golden core of safeguarding and caring for children and nurturing children, so they can optimise all the things that are going for them, then actually we will take a significant step forward."" The Department for Education said it had invested funds to support vulnerable children. And its advice for schools was clear: ""Continue to identify and report any incidences of abuse or harm."" ""We are placing social workers in schools to help spot the signs of abuse and neglect more quickly and work with teachers to support children at risk,"" it added.

"This video can not be played ""That's my car... submerged"": Video shows flooded streets in Pensacola, Florida Tropical Storm Sally has left more than half a million Americans without power as its torrential rains and storm surges lashed the US Gulf coast. Sally weakened after it made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane on Wednesday, but the slow-moving storm continues to batter Florida and Alabama. One person was killed and hundreds were rescued from flooded areas. Pensacola, in Florida, was badly hit, with a loose barge bringing down part of the Bay Bridge. ""Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues over portions of the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama,"" the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

One person died and another was missing in the town of Orange Beach, Alabama, the mayor said without giving further details. Sally made landfall at Gulf Shores, Alabama, at 04:45 local time on Wednesday, with maximum wind speeds of 105mph (169 km/h). According to the NHC, Category 2 hurricanes havesustained winds of 96 to 110 mph,external. The NHC says a Category 2 storm's ""extremely dangerous winds"" usually cause damage to homes and shallowly rooted trees. The storm later become a tropical depression with winds decreasing to 35mph, but it has been the torrents of rainfall and high storm surges that have caused most damage. As the storm moved north from the coast, some 550,000 residents in affected areas were left in the dark on Wednesday night, according to local reports. Sally is one of several storms in the Atlantic Ocean, with officials running out of letters to name the hurricanes as they near the end of their annual alphabetic list.

Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said many areas around Mobile were seeing historic flood levels and urged people to heed warnings. The pier at Gulf State Park in Alabama suffered significant damage. Gulf Shores in Alabama hosted Sally's landfall and its torrential rain The latest on power cuts fromthe poweroutage.us website,externallists some 290,000 customers without electricity in Alabama and 253,000 more in Florida. As well as pylons being brought down, many trees were uprooted. Rain appeared to fall sideways in Alabama, which led to submerged roads as the storm inched ashore. Other areas along the coast were also affected, with beaches and highways swamped in Mississippi and low-lying properties in Louisiana covered by the rising waters. Alabama, Florida and Mississippi all declared states of emergency ahead of the storm. John De Block, at the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, told the New York Times that Sally was drifting ""at the speed of a child in a candy shop"". Sally's pace may be linked to climate change, according to experts. A 2018 study in Nature magazine found that the speed at which hurricanes and tropical storms move over an area had decreased by 10% between 1949 and 2016, a drop that was linked to an increase in total rainfall. ""Sally has a characteristic that isn't often seen, and that's a slow forward speed and that's going to exacerbate the flooding,"" NHC deputy director Ed Rappaport told the Associated Press. In addition to Sally, there are four other tropical cyclones - Paulette, Rene, Teddy and Vicky - swirling in the Atlantic Ocean basin. If only one more storm is officially named - Wilfred has already been chosen - meteorologists will run out of preselected names for the rest of the year and so will begin naming new storms after the Greek alphabet.

"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething announced the lockdown during a press conference A second county in Wales will go into lockdown because of the rate of coronavirus cases. The 240,000 people living in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) will have restrictions imposed on their daily lives. From 18:00 BST on Thursday, people will not be able to enter or leave the area without a reasonable excuse, such as travel for work or education. All licensed pubs, bars and restaurants will have to shut by 23:00 every day, once the lockdown comes into effect. People will also be banned from meeting people outside their own households indoors. What can I do in Rhondda and Caerphilly lockdown? Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there had been a ""rapid"" rise in cases, with 82.1 infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days. The latest equivalent figure across the whole of Wales is 21.4 per 100,000. It is the second local lockdown in Wales, after Caerphilly county borough was made subject to restrictions last week. A trip to Doncaster was said to be associated with one of the clusters of cases in RCT. A statement on Wednesday evening from the Welsh Government clarified the party did not attend the races being held in the South Yorkshire town,as part of a pilot event for 2,500 people.

Testing centres have been opened in the county borough Wednesday's rate of positive tests for the past week in RCT was 5.1% - the highest in Wales. Mr Gething previously warned a positive rate of 4% across Waleswould trigger a national lockdown. The Wales average is 2.4%. Figures on Wednesday showed RCT's case rate had almost caught up with Caerphilly, which had 83.4 per 100,000 people over the past seven days. The lockdown restrictions have been imposed despite people in RCT having been asked to takeextra precautions last week. A review into the lockdown will be held in two weeks' time. Contact tracing teams have been able to trace about half of the coronavirus cases in RCT ""back to a series of clusters within the borough"", Mr Gething told a press conference. ""The rest are evidence of community transmission."" One cluster is associated with a rugby club and a pub in the lower Rhondda valley, another is connected to a club outing to Doncaster, which Mr Gething said stopped off at a series of pubs on the way. ""My message is that is absolutely the wrong thing to do,"" said the health minister. ""Somebody in that party should have recognised they were acting outside the rules and they were a significant risk to themselves and their families at home. ""This wasn't a group of young people - it's entirely possible for people in their 40s and 50s to behave irresponsibly, and we've seen a significant spread from that event. ""So think about the choices you're making and about how you, your family and community would want to be kept safe."" Doncaster Racecourse has confirmed it had no ticket bookings for any groups from south Wales for the event. ""Doncaster Racecourse has received no contact from any organisation, including the NHS or the Welsh Government, to verify the attendance of any individuals at last week's event for the purposes of track and trace,"" it said. Under the lockdown rules, no-one will be able to leave or enter the county without a reasonable excuse. The list of excuses to travel is the sameas in Caerphilly, including: For essentials - food and medicine For work, if you cannot work from home, or for education To obtain supplies for the essential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation or to get access to public services Motorists will be able to drive through the county borough, providing they do not stop. The rules can be enforced by a system of fixed penalty notices, which start at Â£60 to a maximum of Â£1,920, or unlimited fines in the courts. People had been asked to take precautions last week in RCT as cases rose ""It's really scary,"" says florist Joy Carter Joy Carter owns the florist Flowers By Joy in Aberdare town centre. She described the local lockdown as a ""nightmare again"". ""It's crazy. Last time it was so difficult. I don't understand how I can go into a pub but not a house. ""I'm doing flowers for a wedding this Saturday - what will they do? It's been so difficult with the weddings and funerals."" She said the town had been busy all day, but added: ""What's it going to be like tomorrow? ""As for trade, people are going to be too afraid to go out again, especially older people. A few have said they had better stay in. ""It's really scary."" She said she will stay open ""even if I put the shutters down and just take orders over the phone"". ""I don't think anyone can be blamed. I think it's going to be around for a long time,"" she said. Barber Sirwan Hussein says people are not wearing masks in the town Barber Sirwan Hussein said it was clear there was problems with people respecting covid rules. ""I think people don't care about social distancing,"" he said. ""I've been around everywhere, and not many people are wearing a mask. ""The UK is going to be locked down again - we'll all be in lockdown again."" He said he had a client who did not want to wear a mask, even though it is now the law indoors in Wales. ""He said if they want to fine me - fine me - I'll pay the fine, but I'm not going to wear a mask."" Butcher David Bishop hopes a new lockdown will bring a boost for local businesses Aberdare butcher David Bishop said he did not believe the new rules in RCT would not have a major impact. ""Everything is going to be open as normal, it just affects the daily lives of families meeting together,"" said the 54-year-old. He said there could be a silver lining for businesses such as his. ""We were open right through the original lockdown, and in real terms it actually got busier for us,"" he said. ""Now it's back to normal levels - maybe this will make us busier again."" Rules allowing people to meet six people from their extended household in Wales will also not apply in RCT. Mr Gething said residents will be able to meet outdoors ""for the time being"". University of South Wales students will still be able to travel in and out of RCT for their studies, despite the new restrictions. Speaking in the Senedd, Mr Gething said: ""It would be permissible for people to move into that area and to stay there for their study."" He said students would need to observe the local restrictions while they were there."" Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""Now we need to stick to the rules and get the transmission rate down to protect the NHS and the most vulnerable."" Leanne Wood, Plaid Cymru Rhondda Member of the Senedd (MS), said it was ""disappointing, but not a surprise"". ""The sooner we get this under control, the sooner we can ease restrictions and the safer our loved ones will be,"" she added. Pontypridd Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones said: ""I know the news of tighter coronavirus restrictions will be worrying for people across Ponty, but I am confident that this is the right approach in order to reduce the number of cases locally."" The Rhondda Cynon Taf area is home to 240,000 people The difference in rules around pubs in RCT and Caerphilly prompted questions from the Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies. ""The health minister must explain the rationale behind this and give guidance across Wales to prevent other lockdowns."" Mr Gething told his press conference that pubs were a ""factor in transmission"" in RCT, but had not been in Caerphilly. He said a series of bars and pubs have faced closures and improvement notices in the area. A bar has been shut in Pontypridd after a series of breaches were captured on CCTV, a licensed premise was closed in Tonypandy and improvement notices for another bar in Pontypridd and a barbers in Tonypandy were also issued. A further 50 licensed premises were visited by council officers over the weekend, Mr Gething said. Asked why he was not closing all pubs, Mr Gething said: ""If there are no opportunities to drink in licenced premises we may see more people breaking the rules and drinking in each other's homes."" Ystrad councillor Elyn Stephens told theLocal Democracy Reporting Serviceshe welcomed the decision to impose fresh restrictions, however she said some concerns remained over pubs. ""There are questions to be answered about why the lockdown wasn't localised to the known clusters, in the lower Rhondda, a fortnight ago when they first became apparent. ""The response I've received so far to the announcement has been overwhelming anger and frustration that the pubs are still open, when residents cannot see their families.""

"The charity hopes to reopen Tedworth House in Wiltshire as a recovery centre for wounded, injured and sick service veterans Military charity Help for Heroes says 142 staff roles are at risk, as its income has dropped by nearly a third during the pandemic. The charity, which supports wounded veterans and their families, says there are likely to be about 80 redundancies. It relies on donations for 97% of its funding, but its fundraisers have been cancelled or postponed since March. Charity chief Melanie Waters said: ""These tough decisions have been made to protect the future of the charity."" Three Help for Heroes recovery centres - in Yorkshire, Devon and Essex - will remain closed indefinitely as Help for Heroes focuses on face-to-face community and online-based support. The charity said demand for its services rose by 33% during May and June - compared to the same period last year - as the consequences of the national lockdown impacted on veterans' mental health. Requests for help with physical conditions also increased by nearly a third over the same period. Meanwhile, the charity - which furloughed 130 staff at the start of the pandemic - said it anticipates funding will remain down by around a third for the foreseeable future, as the economy struggles to recover. Ms Waters said a major restructure was the only way the charity could continue with its work. ""In 2007, we made a promise on behalf of the nation to provide lifetime support to wounded veterans, and their families, and we are striving to keep that promise,"" she saidin a statement on their website.,external ""The crisis has had a devastating impact on the whole UK charity sector, with lasting consequences, and it has hit us hard."" The charity said it was working closely with the Ministry of Defence ""to provide core recovery activities for wounded, injured or sick service personnel"" and hoped to reopen its Tedworth House recovery centre in Wiltshire, with social distancing measures in place - as well as their community office in Wales. Last year, the charity - which was set up in 2007 by former Army Captain Bryn Parry and wife Emma - raised around Â£27m. ""We remain absolutely committed to our wounded and theirâ¯families and will continue fighting for, and changing the lives of, those we support for as long as they need it,"" said Ms Waters.

"Barbados has announced its intention to remove Queen Elizabeth as its head of state and become a republic. ""The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,"" the Caribbean island nation's government said. It aims to complete the process in time for the 55th anniversary of independence from Britain, in November 2021. A speech written by Prime Minister Mia Mottley said Barbadians wanted a Barbadian head of state. ""This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving,"" the speech read. Buckingham Palace said that it was a matter for the government and people of Barbados. A source at Buckingham Palace said that the idea ""was not out of the blue"" and ""has been mooted and publicly talked about many times"", BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said. One of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands Gained its independence from Britain in 1966 Queen Elizabeth remains its constitutional monarch Once heavily dependent on the sugar exports, its economy has diversified into tourism and finance Its prime minister is Mia Mottley, elected in 2018 and the first woman to hold the post The statement was part of the Throne Speech, which outlines the government's policies and programmes ahead of the new session of parliament. While it is read out by the governor-general, it is written by the country's prime minister. The speech also quoted a warning from Errol Barrow, Barbados's first prime minister after it gained independence, who said that the country should not ""loiter on colonial premises"". The speech was written by Prime Minister Mia Mottley His is not the only voice in Barbados that has been suggesting a move away from the monarchy. A constitutional review commission recommended republican status for Barbados in 1998. And Ms Mottley's predecessor in officer, Freundel Stuart, also argued for a ""move from a monarchical system to a republican form of government in the very near future"". Barbados would not be the first former British colony in the Caribbean to become a republic. Guyana took that step in 1970, less than four years after gaining independence from Britain. Trinidad and Tobago followed suit in 1976 and Dominica in 1978. All three stayed within theCommonwealth, a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. It is actually quite unusual for a country to remove the Queen as its head of state. The last to do so was Mauritius in 1992. Other Caribbean countries like Dominica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago became republics in the 1970s. Many of the 15 countries that are currently part of the Queen's realm seem to value the relationship it provides with her and the United Kingdom. Of course, some have talked for years of slipping the royal anchor and establishing their own heads of state. But other political objectives often get in the way. Certainly this is not the first time that politicians in Barbados have declared their intention to become a republic. The question is whether this decision will be matched by others. Jamaica has in the past suggested that this is a route it might follow. What is significant is that the prime minister of Barbados cast the decision as ""leaving our colonial past behind"". In the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, it will be interesting to see if this sparks wider political pressure on other Caribbean governments to go the same way. And if this happens, and the removal of the Queen as head of state is placed on a par with, say, the removal of a statue of a slave trader, then that could pose difficult questions for both the British royal family and the Commonwealth.

"Almost two million people in north-east England are expected to face restrictions as coronavirus cases rise. Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas are in discussions to get the measures. These may include pubs closing earlier and restrictions on households mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson toldthe Sun:,external""The only way to make sure the country is able to enjoy Christmas is to be tough now."" He previously said the government was doing ""everything in our power"" to avoid another nationwide lockdown. The PMalso told the newspaper,externalthe government is promising Â£546m as part of a plan to help protect care homes from coronavirus this winter. PM: Second national lockdown would be 'disastrous'  A full announcement detailing the new measures for the North East is expected later on Thursday. ""The number of cases has been rising rapidly in many parts of the country, but in particular in the North East, and so a decision has been made to impose further restrictions there,"" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told ITV's Peston programme on Wednesday. ""And a full announcement will be made tomorrow and so people living in that part of the country should watch out for that. And the measures will come into play at midnight on Thursday evening."" MPs from the area met with Health Minister Nadine Dorries on Wednesday evening. BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt,externalsaid a Labour MP told him measures would include pubs closing at 22:00 BST, no mixing with other households and public transport only for essential travel. Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said the temporary measures would mainly be a restriction on social gatherings. ""The evidence we've found from local testing is that it's spreading in three main areas: in pubs, in people's homes and in grassroots sports,"" he said. ""So [council leaders] have put together a series of requests to government for additional restrictions around these areas for a fixed period of time to try to prevent a damaging full lockdown."" The council leaders had also requested additional funding for policing to enforce the measures, as well as additional local testing facilities, Mr Forbes added. ""All of the testing facilities in our region are more or less at full capacity every day - we're hearing stories of people being sent 200 miles to get a test and that's not acceptable. ""That's why we've asked as council leaders for more resources immediately, because we need to make sure anyone with symptoms gets an immediate test and gets the result back straight away."" Gateshead is among the areas due to face tougher local restrictions The North East has seen a resurgence of coronavirus in recent weeks andfour boroughs were last week placed on the government's watchlistfor areas needing ""enhanced support"". On Monday, councils in the seven areas of Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Gateshead, County Durham and Sunderland called for new restrictions. BBC analysis of the government's figures shows that, as of Wednesday, Bolton had the highest rate in England at 204.1 per 100,000 people in the week to 13 September. Sunderland's rate was 82.1 per 100,000 people, South Tyneside was 93.4, Gateshead was 81.7, Newcastle was 64.1, North Tyneside was 46.7, with County Durham at 37.4 and Northumberland at 25.7. In total there were 1,106 new cases in a seven-day period. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We constantly monitor infection rates across the country and keep all measures under review in consultation with local leaders. ""Any changes to local restrictions will be announced in the usual way."" Other parts of the UK, including Birmingham and Greater Manchester, are already subject toincreased measures. Inan interview with the Sun,externalon Thursday, Mr Johnson compared the graph showing UK virus cases to the humps on a camel's back, saying the aim is to ""stop the surge"" in cases and ""flatten the second hump"". He said he did not want to lock down sections of the economy, but that the government ""will be looking at"" requiring pubs to close early. On Wednesday, the prime minister told a committee of MPs a second national lockdown would be potentially ""disastrous"" for the UK. He admitted there was not enough testing capacity - amidwidespread reports of difficulties obtaining them- and said new nationwide restrictions such as the ""rule of six"" were necessary to ""defeat"" the disease. Coronavirus cases across the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219,according to figures from the government.,external While parts of north-west England have consistently had the highest rates of new infections for some time now, areas of the North East have also been reporting big increases. In the week to 30 August Sunderland had 24 cases. Two weeks later it was 228. The rise in South Tyneside was also very large, up from 70 cases in the last week of August to 141 in the week to 13 September. Parts of the region are recording rates they haven't seen since May, when the country was still subject to most of the full lockdown measures. Testing capacity has increased since then but there have been shortages due to therecent surge in demand. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"The government is facing criticism over its ""world-beating"" coronavirus testing system after people reported struggles to get tests, including being offered slots at testing sites a long way away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and various cabinet members have been defending the scheme, and have claimed that testing capacity is increasing and that the average trip to get tested isn't that far. We've looked at five of their claims. The health secretary made this claim in the House of Commons - last week, he said the average distance was 6.4 miles. Initially, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not release the data on this - despite our repeated requests to see it.Now it has released some of it.,external It supports Mr Hancock's claims. It states that the median distance travelled (that's the point at which half the trips were shorter and half longer) in England in the last week was 5.8 miles. This was down from 6.4 miles the previous week. It also shows that the 5% of people travelled more than 47 miles away for a test - that would make a round-trip of 94 miles.How far are people travelling to get tested? It counts trips made to regional test centres, local walk-ins and mobile test units. What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? How do I get a coronavirus test? Not enough tests for five months, study predicts It doesn't supply the numbers of people butwe know 360,000 tests were processed from these sites,externalin the latest week. 5% of this figure would be around 18,000 people who travelled nearly 50 miles to a test centre (although some may have got more than one test). The data also shows that most people (75%) travelled around 13 miles each way. The DHSC has also given us details about how it worked the distances out. It uses a straight line from someone's location to the test site ""as the crow flies"". But this doesn't take into account that most roads are not in a straight line between the two points - so average distance actually travelled will be higher. For example, if someone was to drive between the BBC offices in central London and the Wembley testing facility, the exact distance between the two is 5.5 miles (8.9km). However, once you take into account the actual roads, this increases to about eight miles. Finally, the data only records people who booked a test. It doesn't tell us how many tried to get one, decided the one they were offered was too far away and didn't take it. As of 30 August, the UK had processed just over 15m antigen tests, - the ones which tell you whether you currently have coronavirus. This total is higher than any other country in Europe, according to data collected by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency. Their figures show that, by this date: Germany processed 12.3m tests France processed 7.4m tests Comparisons between countries will not always be perfect, because some countries report less often and there might be some differences in methodology. A coronavirus testing centre in Cologne's Rautenstrauch Joest museum Boris Johnson has also claimed that the UK is testing more per head of population than France, Germany and Spain. Looking at this measure allows for differences in population size between countries. Mr Johnson is right - according to ECDC data on tests per 1,000 people for the week ending 30 August: UK - 19 tests per 1,000 France - 13 tests per 1,000 Germany - 13 tests per 1,000 Spain - 12 tests per 1,000 The data also shows that four European countries rank higher than the UK, including Denmark on 42 tests per 1,000. The home secretary is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. For example, on 10 September, labs in the UK would have been able to process 244,000 antigen tests, which indicate if you currently have the virus, but processed 204,000. This means, in theory, labs could have processed results for 40,000 more tests. Last week, Sarah-Jane Marsh, a director of the government's test-and-trace programme in England, confirmed there was a problem with the labs, offering a ""heartfelt apology"" to those who couldn't get a test. ""All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded, it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point,"" she said. Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but on Tuesday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the backlog was ""less than a day's capacity"". This means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. He added that this has been driven by a surge in demand as children go back to school and adults return to work. We have asked the government why - in a system with more lab capacity than actual tests carried out - there is a backlog, but have had no response. The latest test return times in England we have, are for the week to 9 September - the figure is actually for people getting results within 24 hours rather than the next day. The figure Mr Johnson appears to be referring to is the proportion of test results published within 24 hours of them being received by a laboratory -it was 88.8% according to the latest figures,external. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health But this excludes the time it takes to get the test to the lab, and it's for pillar 1 tests, which are for people with a clinical need and are processed in Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals. For pillar 2 tests,the ones for the wider population and run by private labs,external, the median turnaround time from taking a test at a regional test site to getting the result was 27 hours, which means half of tests took longer than that, and half took less time. For mobile testing units that figure was 26 hours, but for satellite testing centres it was 97 hours. Satellite tests are ones which are processed by private labs and sent to places like care homes or hospitals. The government says tests in these settings are often conducted over multiple days. This means that someone might take a test a few days before it is collected. Outside permanent drive-through testing sites, people can also get testing kits delivered to their home or visit mobile testing sites, which move around according to demand. Ms Patel is correct that there has been an increase in both of these, doubling in number since the end of May. It is difficult to confirm whether more tests are taking place in lockdown areas because - again - the government does not release this data by local authority. We also don't know how many people have asked for tests but have not been able to get them when they want them. On 15 September, the health secretary said 9,278 Pillar 2 - or commercially run - tests were carried out in the top 10 most affected areas of the country. That equates to about 7.5% of all tests on an average day. These 10 areas make up 5% of the population, meaning they received proportionally more tests.

"Almost two million people in north-east England are expected to face restrictions as coronavirus cases rise. Northumberland, Newcastle, Sunderland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and County Durham council areas are in discussions to get the measures. These may include pubs closing earlier and restrictions on households mixing. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson toldthe Sun:,external""The only way to make sure the country is able to enjoy Christmas is to be tough now."" He previously said the government was doing ""everything in our power"" to avoid another nationwide lockdown. The PMalso told the newspaper,externalthe government is promising Â£546m as part of a plan to help protect care homes from coronavirus this winter. PM: Second national lockdown would be 'disastrous'  A full announcement detailing the new measures for the North East is expected later on Thursday. ""The number of cases has been rising rapidly in many parts of the country, but in particular in the North East, and so a decision has been made to impose further restrictions there,"" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told ITV's Peston programme on Wednesday. ""And a full announcement will be made tomorrow and so people living in that part of the country should watch out for that. And the measures will come into play at midnight on Thursday evening."" MPs from the area met with Health Minister Nadine Dorries on Wednesday evening. BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt,externalsaid a Labour MP told him measures would include pubs closing at 22:00 BST, no mixing with other households and public transport only for essential travel. Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said the temporary measures would mainly be a restriction on social gatherings. ""The evidence we've found from local testing is that it's spreading in three main areas: in pubs, in people's homes and in grassroots sports,"" he said. ""So [council leaders] have put together a series of requests to government for additional restrictions around these areas for a fixed period of time to try to prevent a damaging full lockdown."" The council leaders had also requested additional funding for policing to enforce the measures, as well as additional local testing facilities, Mr Forbes added. ""All of the testing facilities in our region are more or less at full capacity every day - we're hearing stories of people being sent 200 miles to get a test and that's not acceptable. ""That's why we've asked as council leaders for more resources immediately, because we need to make sure anyone with symptoms gets an immediate test and gets the result back straight away."" Gateshead is among the areas due to face tougher local restrictions The North East has seen a resurgence of coronavirus in recent weeks andfour boroughs were last week placed on the government's watchlistfor areas needing ""enhanced support"". On Monday, councils in the seven areas of Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Gateshead, County Durham and Sunderland called for new restrictions. BBC analysis of the government's figures shows that, as of Wednesday, Bolton had the highest rate in England at 204.1 per 100,000 people in the week to 13 September. Sunderland's rate was 82.1 per 100,000 people, South Tyneside was 93.4, Gateshead was 81.7, Newcastle was 64.1, North Tyneside was 46.7, with County Durham at 37.4 and Northumberland at 25.7. In total there were 1,106 new cases in a seven-day period. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We constantly monitor infection rates across the country and keep all measures under review in consultation with local leaders. ""Any changes to local restrictions will be announced in the usual way."" Other parts of the UK, including Birmingham and Greater Manchester, are already subject toincreased measures. Inan interview with the Sun,externalon Thursday, Mr Johnson compared the graph showing UK virus cases to the humps on a camel's back, saying the aim is to ""stop the surge"" in cases and ""flatten the second hump"". He said he did not want to lock down sections of the economy, but that the government ""will be looking at"" requiring pubs to close early. On Wednesday, the prime minister told a committee of MPs a second national lockdown would be potentially ""disastrous"" for the UK. He admitted there was not enough testing capacity - amidwidespread reports of difficulties obtaining them- and said new nationwide restrictions such as the ""rule of six"" were necessary to ""defeat"" the disease. Coronavirus cases across the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219,according to figures from the government.,external While parts of north-west England have consistently had the highest rates of new infections for some time now, areas of the North East have also been reporting big increases. In the week to 30 August Sunderland had 24 cases. Two weeks later it was 228. The rise in South Tyneside was also very large, up from 70 cases in the last week of August to 141 in the week to 13 September. Parts of the region are recording rates they haven't seen since May, when the country was still subject to most of the full lockdown measures. Testing capacity has increased since then but there have been shortages due to therecent surge in demand. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Joe Biden has said he will not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"" if he is elected US President in November. The Democratic candidate said any UK-US trade deal had to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been trying to reassure US politicians about the latest Brexit developments during a trip to Washington. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he trusted the UK to ""get this right"". But US Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there was ""no chance"" of a UK-US trade deal getting through the US Congress if the UK violated international agreements, undermining the Good Friday Agreement. After a meeting with Mr Raab, the Speaker of the House of Representatives said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to ""imperil"" peace in Northern Ireland.

Brexit is high on the agenda at the Washington meetings, after the Internal Market Billcleared its first parliamentary hurdleearlier this week. The proposed law would give the UK government the power to override part of the Brexit withdrawal deal - which Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October. This video can not be played The Good Friday Agreement: A brief guide It now faces further scrutiny in the House of Commons, and also needs to be passed by the House of Lords. If the law comes into force, it would breach international law - a prospect that prompted an angry response from senior figures in the US last week. Mr Biden hosts a reception for then Irish PM Enda Kenny and wife Fionnuala in 2014 By BBC Northern Ireland Dublin Correspondent Shane Harrison Joe Biden is a proud Irish American with roots in counties Louth and Londonderry on his mother's side. He takes a keen interest in Irish affairs and frequently peppers his speeches with quotes from Irish poets. When he was Barack Obama's Vice President he hosted successive Irish prime ministers during the St Patrick's day festivities and has been known to holiday and play golf in Ireland with some of the republic's leaders. So his comments about the Good Friday Agreement should come as no surprise. Indeed they largely echo concerns expressed by senior Democrat politicians in Congress to British ministers about the impact Brexit may have on the peace process. The only difference is Joe Biden may soon be elected President of the United States - still the most powerful country in the world. On Tuesday, four senior congressmen also issued a similar warning, saying a UK-US trade deal would be blocked if the UK failed to preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement. The letter was signed by Democratic congressmen Eliot Engel, Richard Neal, and Bill Keating, who all chair committees in the US House of Representatives, as well as Republican Congressman Peter King. How could the Brexit deal change? What is the Northern Ireland protocol PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons However, asked about the bill at a joint UK-US press conference Mr Pompeo said: ""We trust the UK, we know the complexities of the situation, I have great confidence they will get this right."" Mr Raab said ""the threat to the Good Friday Agreement comes from the EU's politicisation of the issue"". He defended the bill as ""precautionary and proportionate"" adding ""what we can't have is the EU seeking to erect a border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain"". Asked earlier about the letter from US politicians, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think when they understand what we are trying to do they will share our ambition and concern which is to protect the peace process."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, said the ""rhetoric coming from Washington is growing increasingly ridiculous"". He said if a post-Brexit trade deal were allowed to lead to new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, this would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement. ""Do unionist voices not matter in [Washington ] DC, or is it just about the Irish-American vote rather than peace in Belfast?,"" he added. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 By BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack This is not the first time that Brexit and the peace accord's paths have crossed. During negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,some claimed a hard borderbetween NI and the Republic of Ireland would breach the Good Friday Agreement. But critics of that argument point out thatthe text does not contain an explicit commitment,externalnever to harden the border, and there is nothing about customs posts or regulatory controls. The only place in which it alludes to infrastructure at the border is in the section on security, which cites ""the removal of security installations"". Unionists say the real breach of the deal is the NI Protocol, which instead places an economic border in the Irish Sea. They claim it breaks the Good Friday Agreement, as it does not have the consent of both communities. What this latest argument is really about is whether the government's new Brexit plans for Northern Ireland breach the ""spirit"" of the peace deal. That in itself is open to interpretation - but is widely understood to be a spirit of non-violence, consent and partnership. That's what has prompted the intervention from several prominent US politicians, and debate over this is likely to deepen as Brexit talks move towards a conclusion. In his talks on Wednesday, Mr Raab argued that the government's plans are precautionary and proportionate - and in response to what ministers describe as threats from the EU to block food imports. Mr Raab also met Mr Pompeo, amid continuing transatlantic tensions over Iran. The US secretary of state recently accused the UK and its European allies of ""siding with the Ayatollahs"" for blocking further United Nations sanctions on Iran. What just happened with Brexit?

"The UK government's law officer for Scotland, Lord Keen, has resigned amid a legal row over Brexit legislation. The advocate general said he had ""found it increasingly difficult to reconcile"" his obligations as a lawyer with provisions in the Internal Market Bill. Ministers have admitted that their plans could ""break international law"". Lord Keen's resignation was initially not accepted by Downing Street, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying that conversations were ongoing. However it was later confirmed that he had left his post. The government's most senior lawyer - Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the government legal department -had already resigned over the bill, which passed its first parliamentary test on Monday. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis hastold MPs the legislation could break international lawby overriding the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. Lord Keen initially tried to defend the legislation, arguing that Mr Lewis had ""essentially answered the wrong question"". He told the House of Lords that his view was that ""the bill does not of itself constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law"". But the Northern Ireland secretary later doubled down, saying that his statement was a ""very straight answer"" which was ""absolutely in line"" with legal advice. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says he gave the âcorrectâ answer when he was asked if the Internal Market Bill would break international law. In his resignation letter, Lord Keen said it had been a ""privilege"" to serve as advocate general for Scotland, but said that the government ""faces challenges on a number of fronts and I fear that the internal market bill in its present form will not make these any easier"". He added: ""Over the past week I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a law officer with your policy intentions with respect to the Internal Markets Bill. ""I have endeavoured to identify a respectable argument for the provisions at clauses 42 to 45 of the bill, but it is now clear that this will not meet your policy intentions. ""In these circumstances I consider that it is my duty to tender my resignation from your government."" Mr Johnson had said discussions about Lord Keen's future were ""continuing"" on Wednesday afternoon when he appeared before the Commons Liaison Committee. But shortly after the committee concluded, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that the advocate general had left his post and thanked him for his service. The BBC understands Mr Johnsonhas already struck a deal with potential Tory rebelsover the legislation, which would give MPs ""an extra layer of parliamentary oversight"". Richard Keen had been the chairman of the Scottish Conservatives until being appointed as Advocate General in 2015 - when he was also made a life peer as Baron Keen of Elie. The QC has represented the UK government in court in a number of high-profile cases, including over the prorogation of parliament in 2019 and the ""Article 50"" Brexit case in 2016-17. As a law officer in the UK government, Lord Keen had been defending plans to give ministers powers to change the EU withdrawal agreement in the event that the two sides can't agree a trade deal. He argued that while this part of the UK internal market bill creates tension with the UK's international obligations, that is not unprecedented and that domestic law should prevail. The trouble is, the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has already said that overriding the Brexit divorce deal would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" and he's rejected Lord Keen's suggestion that he'd answered incorrectly. That made it increasingly difficult for Lord Keen to reconcile the government's plans with the law and he wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday morning offering his resignation. Lord Keen is the first member of the government to quit over its approach to this issue, which has drawn criticism from former attorneys general and all five living former prime ministers. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But some senior Conservatives - including former Prime Minister John Major - have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards. This video can not be played Leyen: UK and EU ""jointly agreed"" on withdrawal agreement Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen has warned the UK cannot unilaterally set aside the withdrawal agreement. She said on Wednesday the agreement was the only way to guarantee the Northern Ireland peace process, and warned that its replacement would undermine trust in the UK. PM defends planned Brexit deal changes What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Last week marked the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto generic World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached.

"This video can not be played ""That's my car... submerged"": Video shows flooded streets in Pensacola, Florida Hurricane Sally has brought ""historic and catastrophic flooding"" to the southern US after making landfall. The storm's sluggish speed, roughly 5mph (7km/h), increases its capacity for destruction, pummelling coastal states with heavy rain. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported flooding from Tallahassee, Florida to Mobile Bay in Alabama. It also warned of a ""life-threatening"" storm surge and river flooding inland as far as Georgia. Hurricane Sally is one of several storms in the Atlantic Ocean, with officials running out of letters to name the hurricanes as they near the end of their annual alphabetic list. This video can not be played Hurricane Sally makes landfall in southern US Alabama, Florida and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards,whose state is still recovering from Hurricane Laura last month, tweeted on Tuesday that resident should all have a ""game plan in place for whatever the rest of hurricane season has in store"". White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Wednesday that the administration is ""fully engaged"" as the storm continues to batter the Gulf Coast. ""It's safe to say the White House has been in active contact with all of these governors,"" she said on Fox News. Wednesday morning's NHC update,externalsaid Hurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama at 0445 local time (0945 GMT). Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms The busy hurricane season about to 'go Greek' Climate row as Trump visits fire-hit US West Coast The centre has downgraded the storm from a Category 2 hurricane to a Category 1, but cautioned that the threat from heavy rain and ""catastrophic"" flooding remained. A hurricane advisory is currently in place from the Alabama and Mississippi border to northwestern Florida. The hurricane has winds of 80mph (130km/h) and is moving north-northeast at 5mph (7km/h), up from 3mph (5km/h) earlier on Wednesday. Sally's pace may be linked to climate change, according to experts. A 2018 study in Nature magazine found that the speed at which hurricanes and tropical storms move over an area had decreased by 10% between 1949 and 2016, a drop that was linked to an increase in total rainfall.

""Sally has a characteristic that isn't often seen, and that's a slow forward speed and that's going to exacerbate the flooding,"" NHC deputy director Ed Rappaport told the Associated Press. Rain appeared to fall sideways in Alabama, which led to submerged roads as the storm inched ashore. Other areas along the coast were also affected, with beaches and highways swamped in Mississippi and low-lying properties in Louisiana covered by the rising waters. Alabama is among the US Gulf states currently being battered by Hurricane Sally's heavy rain According to the website poweroutage.us,external, more than 500,000 homes and businesses in Alabama and Florida had reported power cuts by Wednesday morning. In Pensacola, Florida, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told US media that a section of Three Mile Bridge is missing as a result of the storm, which has turned streets into choppy rivers. It is the largest physical damage so far from Hurricane Sally. Meanwhile, Tim Parker, manager of Gulf Coast Gator Ranch & Tours, told local TV station KITV that he was anxious about an initial predicted storm surge of up to 9ft (2.7m) in his home of Moss Point, Mississippi. He feared a repeat of Hurricane Katrina's storm surge in 2005, in which roughly 250 alligators escaped their enclosures. However, as surge predictions have dropped, he has felt some relief. ""Now they're talking about maybe two to four feet, which won't be bad here,"" Mr Parker told KITV. ""My parking lot might go under water. Our office might partially go under water, but it's not going to be too bad."" Hurricane Sally arrives just weeks afterHurricane Laura killed at least six peoplein the state of Louisiana. Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant. But the feared 20ft (6m) storm surge was avoided as the hurricane, the state's biggest, tracked further east. In addition to Sally, there are four other tropical cyclones - Paulette, Rene, Teddy and Vicky - swirling in the Atlantic Ocean basin. If only one more storm is officially named - Wilfred has already been chosen - meteorologists will run out of preselected names for the rest of the year and so will begin naming new storms after the Greek alphabet.

"Sunderland Council said its cases were three times higher than the national rate Sunderland, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Newcastle have been added to Public Health England's Coronavirus watchlist. Sunderland Council said there were 244 new cases in seven days; 75 cases per 100,000 people which is three times higher than the national rate. Council leader Graeme Miller said there would be ""enhanced support"" rather than restrictions. A local lockdown was ""close"" if there was not a ""rapid and drastic reduction in the number of cases"", he said. ""The virus is spreading across Sunderland and we need to work together to stop it."" Areas on the ""enhanced support"" watchlist are given additional resources by the government, such as greater levels of testing. Gateshead said cases had more than trebled in the past seven days with 113 new ones in the first week of September, equating to about 55 cases per 100,000 people. Newcastle City Council said there had been 145 new cases in the past seven days, equating to 48 cases per 100,000 people. The authority's director of public health, Eugene Milne, said almost 60% of people in the city who tested positive in the past two weeks were from the 18 to 30 age group. Enhanced support is the second of three tiers on the watchlist, with the highest level resulting in government intervention in a bid to help slow the spread of the virus.

"The region's leaders say people must self-isolate while waiting for test results There are ""deep concerns"" among local authority leaders about the growing number of coronavirus cases in the north-east of England. The leaders of seven councils have issued a statement urging people to help avoid a ""devastating"" lockdown. They say average daily cases have doubled in just over a week and are averaging about 80 per day. Gateshead, South Tyneside and Middlesbrough are currently among the top 20 areas in England for cases. The statement has been issued by the leaders of Newcastle, South Tyneside, Gateshead, North Tyneside, Northumberland, Durham County and Sunderland councils along with the North of Tyne Mayor. They are particularly concerned about cases among young adults and say in the seven days up to 5 September, almost 66% of cases were people under the age of 30. Their statement says: ""We all have to do our bit and to play our part if we are to prevent a potential second wave. ""The impact that would have on our health service and the possibility of an economically-damaging lockdown would be devastating. ""We ask that individuals protect themselves to protect others and to protect our region, as well as call on all businesses to make sure their premises and operations are Covid-secure.""

"The outbreak is linked to a charity match at Burnside Working Men's Club Up to 300 people who attended a charity football match are being told to self-isolate after 28 people tested positive for Covid-19. The event at Burnside Working Men's Club (WMC), in Fencehouses on the border of Sunderland and Durham, took place on 30 August. Anyone who attended must self-isolate for 14 days from then. Burnside WMC said ""if we knew at the time what we know now"" then the match ""would never have gone ahead"".

"The government is facing criticism over its ""world-beating"" coronavirus testing system after people reported struggles to get tests, including being offered slots at testing sites a long way away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and various cabinet members have been defending the scheme, and have claimed that testing capacity is increasing and that the average trip to get tested isn't that far. We've looked at five of their claims. The health secretary made this claim in the House of Commons - last week, he said the average distance was 6.4 miles. Initially, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not release the data on this - despite our repeated requests to see it.Now it has released some of it.,external It supports Mr Hancock's claims. It states that the median distance travelled (that's the point at which half the trips were shorter and half longer) in England in the last week was 5.8 miles. This was down from 6.4 miles the previous week. It also shows that the 5% of people travelled more than 47 miles away for a test - that would make a round-trip of 94 miles.How far are people travelling to get tested? It counts trips made to regional test centres, local walk-ins and mobile test units. What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? How do I get a coronavirus test? Not enough tests for five months, study predicts It doesn't supply the numbers of people butwe know 360,000 tests were processed from these sites,externalin the latest week. 5% of this figure would be around 18,000 people who travelled nearly 50 miles to a test centre (although some may have got more than one test). The data also shows that most people (75%) travelled around 13 miles each way. The DHSC has also given us details about how it worked the distances out. It uses a straight line from someone's location to the test site ""as the crow flies"". But this doesn't take into account that most roads are not in a straight line between the two points - so average distance actually travelled will be higher. For example, if someone was to drive between the BBC offices in central London and the Wembley testing facility, the exact distance between the two is 5.5 miles (8.9km). However, once you take into account the actual roads, this increases to about eight miles. Finally, the data only records people who booked a test. It doesn't tell us how many tried to get one, decided the one they were offered was too far away and didn't take it. As of 30 August, the UK had processed just over 15m antigen tests, - the ones which tell you whether you currently have coronavirus. This total is higher than any other country in Europe, according to data collected by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency. Their figures show that, by this date: Germany processed 12.3m tests France processed 7.4m tests Comparisons between countries will not always be perfect, because some countries report less often and there might be some differences in methodology. A coronavirus testing centre in Cologne's Rautenstrauch Joest museum Boris Johnson has also claimed that the UK is testing more per head of population than France, Germany and Spain. Looking at this measure allows for differences in population size between countries. Mr Johnson is right - according to ECDC data on tests per 1,000 people for the week ending 30 August: UK - 19 tests per 1,000 France - 13 tests per 1,000 Germany - 13 tests per 1,000 Spain - 12 tests per 1,000 The data also shows that four European countries rank higher than the UK, including Denmark on 42 tests per 1,000. The home secretary is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. For example, on 10 September, labs in the UK would have been able to process 244,000 antigen tests, which indicate if you currently have the virus, but processed 204,000. This means, in theory, labs could have processed results for 40,000 more tests. Last week, Sarah-Jane Marsh, a director of the government's test-and-trace programme in England, confirmed there was a problem with the labs, offering a ""heartfelt apology"" to those who couldn't get a test. ""All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded, it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point,"" she said. Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but on Tuesday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the backlog was ""less than a day's capacity"". This means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. He added that this has been driven by a surge in demand as children go back to school and adults return to work. We have asked the government why - in a system with more lab capacity than actual tests carried out - there is a backlog, but have had no response. The latest test return times in England we have, are for the week to 9 September - the figure is actually for people getting results within 24 hours rather than the next day. The figure Mr Johnson appears to be referring to is the proportion of test results published within 24 hours of them being received by a laboratory -it was 88.8% according to the latest figures,external. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health But this excludes the time it takes to get the test to the lab, and it's for pillar 1 tests, which are for people with a clinical need and are processed in Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals. For pillar 2 tests,the ones for the wider population and run by private labs,external, the median turnaround time from taking a test at a regional test site to getting the result was 27 hours, which means half of tests took longer than that, and half took less time. For mobile testing units that figure was 26 hours, but for satellite testing centres it was 97 hours. Satellite tests are ones which are processed by private labs and sent to places like care homes or hospitals. The government says tests in these settings are often conducted over multiple days. This means that someone might take a test a few days before it is collected. Outside permanent drive-through testing sites, people can also get testing kits delivered to their home or visit mobile testing sites, which move around according to demand. Ms Patel is correct that there has been an increase in both of these, doubling in number since the end of May. It is difficult to confirm whether more tests are taking place in lockdown areas because - again - the government does not release this data by local authority. We also don't know how many people have asked for tests but have not been able to get them when they want them. On 15 September, the health secretary said 9,278 Pillar 2 - or commercially run - tests were carried out in the top 10 most affected areas of the country. That equates to about 7.5% of all tests on an average day. These 10 areas make up 5% of the population, meaning they received proportionally more tests.

"The charity hopes to reopen Tedworth House in Wiltshire as a recovery centre for wounded, injured and sick service veterans Military charity Help for Heroes says 142 staff roles are at risk, as its income has dropped by nearly a third during the pandemic. The charity, which supports wounded veterans and their families, says there are likely to be about 80 redundancies. It relies on donations for 97% of its funding, but its fundraisers have been cancelled or postponed since March. Charity chief Melanie Waters said: ""These tough decisions have been made to protect the future of the charity."" Three Help for Heroes recovery centres - in Yorkshire, Devon and Essex - will remain closed indefinitely as Help for Heroes focuses on face-to-face community and online-based support. The charity said demand for its services rose by 33% during May and June - compared to the same period last year - as the consequences of the national lockdown impacted on veterans' mental health. Requests for help with physical conditions also increased by nearly a third over the same period. Meanwhile, the charity - which furloughed 130 staff at the start of the pandemic - said it anticipates funding will remain down by around a third for the foreseeable future, as the economy struggles to recover. Ms Waters said a major restructure was the only way the charity could continue with its work. ""In 2007, we made a promise on behalf of the nation to provide lifetime support to wounded veterans, and their families, and we are striving to keep that promise,"" she saidin a statement on their website.,external ""The crisis has had a devastating impact on the whole UK charity sector, with lasting consequences, and it has hit us hard."" The charity said it was working closely with the Ministry of Defence ""to provide core recovery activities for wounded, injured or sick service personnel"" and hoped to reopen its Tedworth House recovery centre in Wiltshire, with social distancing measures in place - as well as their community office in Wales. Last year, the charity - which was set up in 2007 by former Army Captain Bryn Parry and wife Emma - raised around Â£27m. ""We remain absolutely committed to our wounded and theirâ¯families and will continue fighting for, and changing the lives of, those we support for as long as they need it,"" said Ms Waters.

"Carbon dioxide emissions from plug-in hybrid cars are as much as two-and-a-half times higher than official tests suggest, according to new research. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are powered by an electric motor using a battery that is recharged by being plugged in or via an on-board petrol or diesel engine. They account for 3% of new car sales. But analysis from pressure groups Transport and Environment and Greenpeace suggest they emit an average of 120g of CO2 per km. That compares with the 44g per km in official ""lab"" tests Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are sold as a low-carbon alternative to traditional vehicles and conventional hybrids - which cannot be recharged from an external source - and are proving increasingly popular. The new research,externalis published as the government considers whether to bring forward a proposed ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and conventional hybrid cars from 2035 to 2030. The BBC understands one suggestion is that plug-in hybrids should be given a stay of execution, with new sales allowed to continue until 2035. That's because they can offer a 20- to 40-mile range as a purely electric vehicle and are therefore potentially significantly less polluting than other vehicles. But this new analysis from Transport and Environment and Greenpeace suggests they don't offer anything like the carbon dioxide savings claimed for them by manufacturers. The official tests indicate that plug-in hybrids emit an average of 44g per km of CO2. These tests are conducted on a circuit and see vehicles driven in a way that regulators consider ""normal"". The real figure, however, according to the report, is more like 120g per km. A really simple guide to climate change The five major challenges facing electric vehicles How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? The pressure groups have analysed what they say is ""real-world"" data on fuel efficiency collected from some 20,000 plug-in hybrid drivers around Europe. These are drivers who have chosen to record their mileage and fuel consumption for surveys or who drive company or leased vehicles whose fuel efficiency is recorded. According to this data-set the lifetime emissions of a plug-in hybrid average around 28 tonnes of CO2. By comparison, the average petrol or diesel car is estimated to emit between 39 and 41 tonnes of CO2 from fuel during its lifetime, a conventional hybrid would typically emit more like 33 tonnes. According to these figures a plug-in hybrid would only deliver an emissions reduction of about a third on a typical petrol or diesel car - far less than the official estimates. The motor industry acknowledges that lab tests don't always reflect real-world use but criticised the report, saying it uses emissions data from a test that is two years old. ""PHEVs provide a flexibility few other technologies can yet match with extended range for longer, out-of-town journeys and battery power in urban areas, reducing emissions and improving city air quality,"" Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told the BBC. He says he expects the range and performance will continue to improve, making them an ""essential stepping stone to a fully electric vehicle"". Greenpeace meanwhile describes PHEVs as ""the car industry's wolf in sheep's clothing"". ""They may seem a much more environmentally friendly choice,"" says Rebecca Newsom, the pressure group's head of politics, ""but false claims of lower emissions are a ploy by car manufacturers to go on producing SUVs and petrol and diesel engines."" Transport and Environment's analysis says a key problem with plug-in hybrids is that so many owners rarely actually charge their cars, meaning they rely on the petrol or diesel engine. Another is that many plug-in hybrid models include design features that automatically turn on the petrol/diesel engine at start-up on a cold day, or will kick in that engine if driver accelerates hard. The latter mode means that the car's emissions will depend a lot on the driver's behaviour. ""If you always charge the battery and tend to do lots of short journeys, they will have very low emissions,"" says Nick Molden, who runs Emissions Analytics, a company that specialises in vehicle emissions evaluation. ""If you never charge the battery and drive very aggressively then they can have significantly higher emissions than the equivalent petrol or diesel model,"" he continues.

"A significant drop in the number of child sexual abuse cases reported to police during lockdown masks the true extent of what's happened to vulnerable children, police chiefs say. National Police Chiefs Council data shows reports in England and Wales fell by 25% between April and August, compared with the same period in 2019. But officers told BBC Newsnight this does not represent the true picture. And senior officers are warning child protection referrals will now rise. Chief Constable Simon Bailey said he suspected the 25% fall was ""a false and misleading picture"" of what children may have experienced during those months. 'Worryingly low number' of at-risk children in school Online child abuse rising during lockdown Child sex abuse charity sees 50% rise in referrals ""Those children that would have been exposed to those adverse experiences during lockdown, it is only going to emerge when they spend time within the safe environment of a school, in contact with their teachers, who are very, very good and adept at identifying those signs - the indicators that something is not right within that child's life,"" he said. Supt Chris Truscott, of South Wales Police, agreed there were limited opportunities during lockdown for vulnerable children to disclose harmful behaviour, which would start to come to light only now schools were back. He too expected an increase in referrals officers would have had no way of identifying during lockdown. ""If they were vulnerable before the pandemic, then the likelihood is that vulnerability will have increased over that period of time,"" Supt Truscott said. ""So I think what we are likely to see is that trickle effect turning more into a river type effect where all of that six months of lockdown experiences which children perhaps have been through [are] aired."" 'My parents put me in dangerous situations' Thousands of police trained to spot childhood trauma Help for trauma in childhood 'fragmented' Supt Truscott is the national police lead onEarly Action Together,external, a multi-agency programme in Wales that aims to stop those with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) - such as living with domestic abuse, divorce, a parent with addictions or in prison, and physical or sexual abuse - entering the criminal justice system. Those who have ACEs are: 14 times more likely to be victims of violence 15 times more likely to commit violence against another person 20 times more likely to be jailed as adults At Pencoed Comprehensive, in Bridgend, assistant head teacher Rob Green said staff training in how pupils' behaviour could indicate traumatic experiences outside school had helped vulnerable children progress. Exclusions are down by almost 60% and attendance has risen. But Mr Greene added: ""Because of what has happened and the changes families have had, maybe losing jobs, some families that now have to make do and go without because of the economic climate we are in, the pressure within the family will increase. ""So I do think we will have a lot more support we will need to put in place and we will be supporting our pupils as best we can."" In England, meanwhile, those responsible for child protection are concerned there is not yet the same integrated approach. Mr Bailey, who heads the Norfolk force, said England had ""some work to do"" putting in place the right joined-up policy. ""It needs to be the golden core that is woven through the fabric of everything that we do, be it in the police service, be it in the Ministry of Justice, be it in the Department for Education, the Department for Health,"" he said. ""We all have a responsibility to ensure that future generations of children have the opportunity to succeed and to thrive. ""And if we get this right, and the golden core of safeguarding and caring for children and nurturing children, so they can optimise all the things that are going for them, then actually we will take a significant step forward."" The Department for Education said it had invested funds to support vulnerable children. And its advice for schools was clear: ""Continue to identify and report any incidences of abuse or harm."" ""We are placing social workers in schools to help spot the signs of abuse and neglect more quickly and work with teachers to support children at risk,"" it added.

"The UK government's law officer for Scotland, Lord Keen, has resigned amid a legal row over Brexit legislation. The advocate general said he had ""found it increasingly difficult to reconcile"" his obligations as a lawyer with provisions in the Internal Market Bill. Ministers have admitted that their plans could ""break international law"". Lord Keen's resignation was initially not accepted by Downing Street, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying that conversations were ongoing. However it was later confirmed that he had left his post. The government's most senior lawyer - Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the government legal department -had already resigned over the bill, which passed its first parliamentary test on Monday. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis hastold MPs the legislation could break international lawby overriding the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. Lord Keen initially tried to defend the legislation, arguing that Mr Lewis had ""essentially answered the wrong question"". He told the House of Lords that his view was that ""the bill does not of itself constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law"". But the Northern Ireland secretary later doubled down, saying that his statement was a ""very straight answer"" which was ""absolutely in line"" with legal advice. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says he gave the âcorrectâ answer when he was asked if the Internal Market Bill would break international law. In his resignation letter, Lord Keen said it had been a ""privilege"" to serve as advocate general for Scotland, but said that the government ""faces challenges on a number of fronts and I fear that the internal market bill in its present form will not make these any easier"". He added: ""Over the past week I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a law officer with your policy intentions with respect to the Internal Markets Bill. ""I have endeavoured to identify a respectable argument for the provisions at clauses 42 to 45 of the bill, but it is now clear that this will not meet your policy intentions. ""In these circumstances I consider that it is my duty to tender my resignation from your government."" Mr Johnson had said discussions about Lord Keen's future were ""continuing"" on Wednesday afternoon when he appeared before the Commons Liaison Committee. But shortly after the committee concluded, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that the advocate general had left his post and thanked him for his service. The BBC understands Mr Johnsonhas already struck a deal with potential Tory rebelsover the legislation, which would give MPs ""an extra layer of parliamentary oversight"". Richard Keen had been the chairman of the Scottish Conservatives until being appointed as Advocate General in 2015 - when he was also made a life peer as Baron Keen of Elie. The QC has represented the UK government in court in a number of high-profile cases, including over the prorogation of parliament in 2019 and the ""Article 50"" Brexit case in 2016-17. As a law officer in the UK government, Lord Keen had been defending plans to give ministers powers to change the EU withdrawal agreement in the event that the two sides can't agree a trade deal. He argued that while this part of the UK internal market bill creates tension with the UK's international obligations, that is not unprecedented and that domestic law should prevail. The trouble is, the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has already said that overriding the Brexit divorce deal would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" and he's rejected Lord Keen's suggestion that he'd answered incorrectly. That made it increasingly difficult for Lord Keen to reconcile the government's plans with the law and he wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday morning offering his resignation. Lord Keen is the first member of the government to quit over its approach to this issue, which has drawn criticism from former attorneys general and all five living former prime ministers. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But some senior Conservatives - including former Prime Minister John Major - have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards. This video can not be played Leyen: UK and EU ""jointly agreed"" on withdrawal agreement Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen has warned the UK cannot unilaterally set aside the withdrawal agreement. She said on Wednesday the agreement was the only way to guarantee the Northern Ireland peace process, and warned that its replacement would undermine trust in the UK. PM defends planned Brexit deal changes What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Last week marked the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto generic World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached.

"Twenty-nine German police officers have been suspended for sharing pictures of Adolf Hitler and depictions of refugees in gas chambers on their phones. The officers also used far-right chatrooms where swastikas and other Nazi symbols were shared, officials in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) said. NRW Interior Minister Herbert Reul said it was a ""disgrace for NRW police"". It follows several other incidences of far-right extremism among the German security services. How far right caused earthquake in German politics Has Germany done enough to tackle far-right violence? More than 200 police officers were involved in raids on 34 police stations and private homes linked to 11 main suspects. The officers are said to have shared more than 100 neo-Nazi images in WhatsApp groups. Some of the suspects face charges of spreading Nazi propaganda and hate speech. Others are accused of not reporting their colleagues' actions. ""This is the worst and most repulsive kind of hate-baiting,"" Mr Reul said, adding that he expected the investigation to find more chats with offensive content. ""I'm appalled and ashamed,"" said Frank Richter, the police chief in the city of Essen where most of the suspects were based. ""It is hard to find words."" Mr Reul has now launched an investigation into the extent of extremism among the state's police. ""Right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis have absolutely no place in the North Rhine-Westphalia police, our police,"" he said, and the authorities had to show a ""crystal clear political profile"" that rejected the far right. Germany's police and security services have faced accusations that they are not doing enough to root out extremists within their ranks. In July prosecutors said they had arrested a former police officer and his wife who are suspected of sending threats to well-known figures of immigrant background, including several ethnically Turkish lawmakers. The emails were signed ""NSU 2.0"", a reference to the ""National Socialist Underground"" neo-Nazi gang, whichcommitted 10 racist murders between 2000 and 2007. The scandal has already seen the Hesse state police chief Udo MÃ¼nch resign after it emerged that police computers were used to find out details of a left-wing politician who later received one of the threatening emails. Meanwhile, in June, Germany's defence minister orderedthe partial dissolution of the elite KSK commando forceafter growing criticism over right-wing extremism in its ranks. Germany's elite force 'to be partially disbanded' Has Germany done enough to tackle far-right violence?

"England's education secretary has defended the Covid-19 testing system for schools, saying they can now order tests from the NHS directly. Gavin Williamson said schools were being prioritised, amid claims by head teachers of problems accessing tests. He stressed pupils sent home due to a Covid-19 case at their school should only seek tests if they have symptoms. Head teachers have written to the prime minister about their fears of further delays as virus cases rise. In their letter, teaching unions also called for easier access to public health advice to deal with Coronavirus cases in schools. 'Sense of foreboding' The heads of the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers warned Boris Johnson of ""a deep sense of foreboding"" about further delays in the system and called on the government to step up. Some schools in England had close their doors just after reopening, while others have told whole year groups or classes, which form ""bubbles"", to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Booking a test 'like getting Harry Potter tickets' Heads warn of staff shortages without Covid tests School figures show 88% back for start of term Teachers are isolating but still teach - by video Mr Williamson told the education select committee direct access to the test-kit ordering system for schools came into effect on Wednesday morning, two weeks after the start of this term. He told MPs: ""We have always been conscious that, with children coming back into school, there was going to be a situation where people would need more access to testing. ""This was why we have ensured these deliveries of testing kits,"" he said, and why ""just this morning we have opened up the ordering system for schools"". ""The support that we are putting towards education -  this is something quite unique - that schools can be able to pull that supply directly from the NHS."" Some teachers are teaching from home via video link He had met Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, to emphasize the importance and priority of schools and ensure testing is always available to them, he said. He said only people with coronavirus symptoms should be tested, not the whole ""cohort"" who are sent home. Robert Halfon, committee chairman, asked Mr Williamson if he could ""guarantee"" pupils and teachers who needed Covid-19 tests would be able to get them locally within 48 hours in the event of an outbreak. Mr Williamson did not respond to that question but said schools were in a unique position to be able to have testing kits on site. Each school and college was given 10 home-testing kits at the start of term and schools can order more kits online from today, the minister added. A spokesman for the Northern Power House - an organisation seeking to boost industry and education in north of England - said problems were particularly difficult in parts of the north west with higher virus rates. And these areas have have high levels of economic deprivation, she said. ""Poorer pupils already lag behind their classmates and they are falling further and further behind when schools close, as they are less likely to have access to at-home support or technology. ""These children have been effectively hit by a triple-whammy of long-term disadvantage, school closures and now testing chaos. ""With challenges getting testing already wreaking havoc on our education system, it is also the lack of consistency in direction from the Department for Education and public health authorities which is frustrating school leaders when faced with decisions on whether to send home whole 'bubbles' or not. ""Without urgent steps from the government to address these issues, it will be the most vulnerable children who will pay the highest price."" General secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, Dr Patrick Roach, suggested the system was not working. He said: ""Areas where additional local restrictions have been introduced, due to the increase in the R (reproduction) number, are now unable to cope with demand for tests. ""Teachers, support staff and children and young people are unable to access tests where they have Covid-19 symptoms. Employers are struggling to deal with the implications and consequences."" Local authorities across the country - including in the North West of England - are struggling to cope with demand, he added. He highlighted the situation in Bury, where hundreds of pupils are self-isolating, and Salford, where the council has been inundated with requests for tests from schools. Dr Roach said: ""Schools appear to be seeking to do their utmost to carry on. ""However, we have reports that schools are unable to cope with a situation that is becoming increasingly out of control.""

"There is no need for British Airways to lay off cabin crew and then rehire them on inferior terms, boss Alex Cruz has said. Unions and MPs had accused the airline of following a ""fire and rehire"" policy, which saw some employees facing pay cuts of up to 50%. But Mr Cruz told MPs ""there will be no need to issue new contracts"", subject to staff approval. BA reached the outline of a jobs agreement with union Unite last week. The pair have been in a bitter dispute over BA's plans to shed up to 13,000 jobs and cut pay, amid a collapse in demand for air travel. Speaking to the Transport Select Committee, Mr Cruz said it was a matter of ""regret"" that it took 73 days for BA's non-pilot unions to sit down and negotiate. But Labour MP Sam Tarry responded: ""I would argue that if you hadn't put a metaphorical gun to their head then that might not have happened."" This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Mr Cruz said the airline would now follow the ""standard methodology"" of union agreements and make amendments to existing contracts. Details are still being worked out and ballots of some staff are yet to be held. Long-serving cabin crew members face a 15% pay reduction, while hoping to retain many of the allowances which constitute a significant part of their overall pay. ""We have reached agreements in a majority of areas,"" Mr Cruz said. ""We very much hope that the result of the ballots will be to accept those ballots."" In relation to whether or not BA will have to make 13,000 staff redundant, Mr Cruz said that the company didn't ""need to get to that number"". However, a large number of long-serving cabin crew have taken voluntary redundancy and many staff felt that the terms being offered at the time meant that was their only choice. Mr Cruz told MPs that the pandemic had ""devastated our business... and we're still fighting for our own survival"". Last week the airline flew about 187,000 passengers  - about 25%-30% of its normal flight schedule. ""Everyone is facing decisions we never wanted to face,"" Mr Cruz said. He said he had taken a 33% pay cut during the pandemic, reducing his salary from the Â£805,000 he earned in 2019. But he refused to comment on an Â£833,000 bonus paid to the outgoing boss of BA's parent company, Willie Walsh. IAG faced a backlash from shareholders over that payment to Mr Walsh who left the company last week.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Thursday morning. After a day defending the beleaguered testing system in the House of Commons, Boris Johnson faced more questions from a committee of MPs this evening on the possible impact of a second national lockdown.He told them it would be likely to have ""disastrous"" financial consequencesfor the UK and insisted the government was doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent another one. The prime minister also admitted there was not enough testing capacity. Earlierhe blamed a ""colossal spike"" in demandfor ongoing problems with accessing tests and delayed results. Labour, meanwhile, continues to accuse the PM of ""incompetence"" in his handling of the outbreak. This video can not be played Angela Rayner accuses the PM of blaming others for his âincompetence"" with ""no plan"" for a second coronavirus wave In Bolton,more than 100 people turned up at an A&Easking for Covid-19 tests, prompting the hospital trust to urge people who are not seriously ill to stay away. Bolton has the highest infection rate in England with 196 cases per 100,000 people recorded on Saturday. But people there say they can't get booked into test centres. Here'show to get a test. With many staff and students unable to tell a winter bug from the virus, a big factor in the rise in demand has been schools reopening.One teacher told us he spent 11 hours trying to book a test for his young son.""It's like booking Harry Potter tickets,"" he said. School leaders estimate about 740 schools in England have sent home some pupils, whether a bubble, a year group or multiple year groups, said Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis trust. He said one parent called him ""in tears"" after spending days trying to book a test for her child with special needs, only to be offered one she could not reach without a car. A second county in Wales is to face more restrictions on daily lifeafter cases topped 82 per 100,000 people over the past seven days. First it was Caerphilly. Now, from Thursday evening, the people of Rhondda Cynon Taff, in south Wales, must not leave the area without a reasonable excuse and pubs and restaurants can't open later than 23:00. Live in the area? These are thenew rules. In what may well be a world first,a man has been spotted using a snake as a face covering. A fellow passenger on the Swinton to Manchester bus said she had initially thought the man was wearing a ""funky mask"" until she saw the snake slither over a hand rail. Transport officials later confirmed live snakes are not acceptable face coverings, so here'show to make a more suitable one.

"There is fear in India as Covid-19 cases continue to surge In India, relentlessly rising case numbers are causing another emergency - serious mental health problems among Covid-19 patients, writes the BBC's Vikas Pandey. Rajesh Tiwari, 42, has developed a serious phobia of any screen which is bigger than his mobile phone. He thinks big screens, especially TV sets and computer monitors, are giant creatures who can attack him. Mr Tiwari began experiencing hallucinations after a long stay in an intensive care unit. In early June he had tested positive for coronavirus and he was admitted to a private hospital as his condition worsened. Five days later he was put on a ventilator. Mr Tiwari recovered after nearly three weeks in the hospital. But he soon realised that his recovery was not complete. ""I am better now because I sought treatment, but the first few weeks after my discharge from the hospital were very difficult,"" he said in an interview. Many cities have been struggling to cope with the rise in cases Mr Tiwari's family was elated to bring him home, but after a while they realised that everything was not right with him. One day, he screamed at the TV set and attempted to smash it. The family had to stop watching TV and nobody was allowed to use laptops at home. Mr Tiwari said he was struggling to forget the images of monitors constantly beeping and flashing numbers in the ICU. Amit Sharma and his family had a similar experience. Mr Sharma, 49, spent 18 days in the ICU and saw people die every day. Young and old, men and women - all kinds of Covid-19 patients were dying around him. ""One day, two patients around me died and their bodies were there for several hours,"" he said. ""I just can't get those images out of my head. I still fear Covid might kill me."" Mr Sharma is struggling to forget the traumatic experience. He became very quiet at home after his recovery, his uncle said. ""And whenever he talked, it was always about the patients he had seen dying in the Covid ward,"" he said. ICU is most of India's hospitals have been flooded with Covid patients Many recovering coronavirus patients in India are experiencing mental health distress, said Dr Vasant Mundra, a senior psychiatrist at Mumbai's PD Hinduja hospital, particularly those who were on a ventilator or spent a long time in an ICU. ""The brain is already exhausted by the time you get to the hospital. And then the mayhem of the Covid wards overwhelms your senses,"" Dr Mundra said. Covid-19 patients are not allowed to meet family and they don't get to see the faces of their doctors and nurses, who are wearing protective masks at all times. That was disrupting patients' ability to form trust with their doctor, said Dr A Fathahudeen, the head of the critical care department at Ernakulam Medical College in southern India, in turn disrupting their recovery. Recovery from coronavirus can be a lonely experience, and doctors say when a patient experiences life threatening events as well the chance of post traumatic stress drastically increases. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and hallucinations, Dr Mundra said. And yet, mental health issues associated with coronavirus patients are not getting enough attention, doctors warn. There are few mentions in government press conferences or in the media. Prominent mental health expert Dr Soumitra Pathare said he was not surprised. ""What you are seeing during the pandemic is a reflection of India's poor investment in mental health facilities,"" he said. India lacks facilities and experts to treat mental health patients, and the situation is worse in smaller towns where people are often not able even to recognise symptoms. Millions of people in India have lost their jobs during the pandemic Much of India's mental health treatment infrastructure is concentrated in cities, leaving 80%-90% of the population with little or no access to mental health specialists, said Dr Pathare - adding that the gap is becoming clearer during the pandemic. If the government failed to recognise and address the problem soon India would be facing a ""mental health pandemic"", he said. A good starting point would be making people more aware of symptoms, Dr Pathare said. And the next step would be to improve mental health facilities, especially in smaller towns. ""I am aware it won't happen overnight, but we have to start somewhere,"" he said. Doctors are working in special Covid-19 wards across the country Kamna Chhibber, the head of the mental health department at Fortis hospital in Delhi, said she had witnessed a sharp rise in the number of people reaching out for help during the pandemic. A long lockdown, uncertainty over the future, and the need to be constantly alert had made people more anxious, and more people were coming to the hospital to talk generally about anxiety and depression, Ms Chhibber said. The problem was becoming ""more serious with each passing day"", she said. Doctors are now urging for mental health to be addressed as part of post-Covid treatment protocols. Each hospital needed to do something, said Dr Fathahudeen, or ""we may save people from Covid but lose them to depression and PTSD"". The names of the patients have been changed to protect their identities.

"Schools are back, businesses are reopening and winter bugs are starting to spread - meaning more and more people are asking for a coronavirus test. Three families explain how the testing problems are affecting them. Maria Aziz, from west London, has been trying to book a test since Sunday, when her nine-year-old daughter, Mishal, complained of a sore throat. By 04:00 Monday, her daughter had developed a fever. ""I had been trying all of Sunday to try and get a test. I must have tried between seven and 10 times,"" she told the BBC. ""And then yesterday I probably tried about four times at various intervals across the day, starting early in the morning and ending late at night."" After again trying and failing to book a test today, she said she's frustrated. Her eldest daughter, Eimann, 14, has also had to be withdrawn from school while she tries to book a test for her younger daughter. Who should get tested and how do I get one? What are the coronavirus symptoms? ""Even if I have to drive 100 miles to get a test, I'd rather get her tested than not have a test,"" she said. ""If she has it, then that's fine. We will know we need to continue self-isolating. But if she doesn't then it's unfair on my older daughter. She's missed enough school already. ""I'm trying through the government website and then yesterday there was also a number on the website to call - 119 - so I tried that as well. Each time there were no tests available. No home kits. No walk-in slots. No drive-through slots. Nothing. ""It's very frustrating. They've just about managed a week of school before they've had to be off again. It would be good to know one way or the other."" Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family, the spaces had disappeared. ""This is the problem I've found,"" he said. ""When you're doing it for a family of four, either no tests were available at all or after a while it kept taking you right back to the start to put all your details in again. Testing problems will be resolved 'in weeks' - Hancock Coronavirus testing system 'falling over' ""In the end, I just put my wife's details in because she's the most important one to get back to work."" Scott managed to secure a test for his wife today in Luton. He has since managed to book tests for himself and his children at a separate testing centre, in Bedford. ""Both the walk-in centre in Luton and the drive-in car park in Bedford were empty,"" he said. ""The walk-in centre had at least 12 available test booths with only three people there. The drive-in had space for maybe 30 cars. There was only one other car there."" If it happens again, however, the small cafe the family runs may have to close. The business only survived lockdown with the help of a crowd-funding drive and a grant. ""We've only got my wife and another member of staff there. She wouldn't be able to run it on her own so we would have to shut,"" he said. ""Inevitably, kids are going to come home from school with sniffles and colds. We have to shut our business because of that,"" he said. ""So it's not really worth sending the kids in if this going to happen again. We have to really think about it."" The government says anyone can get a test if they have coronavirus symptoms - namely a high temperature, a new or continuous cough, and/or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste You can also get a test for someone you live with if they have these symptoms But you should not get a test or ask for tests for people you live with who do not have Covid-19 symptoms If you have symptoms or test positive, you should remain at home for at least 10 days Other members of your household, including those who do not have any symptoms, should then also stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days Source:UK government testing guidance,external As a family of eight, not everyone has been able to get tested For larger families, it's not just testing availability that can be an issue. ""It's an absolute nightmare trying to navigate the website as a family of eight,"" Christina Fox, from Stockton on Tees, said. The family was advised to book a test after phoning 111 when Christina's seven-year-old daughter developed a high fever and a cough. After trying for seven hours on Sunday, they had managed to secure three tests - for her seven-year-old, whose symptoms were worst, for another daughter who works for NHS 111 and couldn't return before testing negative, and for herself. ""We had the app open on my phone, my daughter's phone and on the computer,"" Ms Fox said. ""It really is like a pot of gold. You have to be there at the right time, the right second, and suddenly a test might appear."" Despite those test results coming back negative, other family members have now developed symptoms, so they have had to continue to isolate. ""We managed to get two more tests this morning,"" Christina said. ""Because my 12-year-old goes to a different school to the younger kids, when I rang this morning they indicated that I should really be getting her tested. ""It's just ridiculous. If they want kids back at school and college and they want the economy to start running again they need to make the provisions for proper testing."" Agovernment spokespersonsaid it was ""processing more than a million tests a week and we recently announced new facilities and technology to process results even faster. ""If you do not have symptoms and are not eligible to get a test you can continue to protect yourself if you wash your hands, wear a face covering and follow social distancing rules.""

"People queue for tests in Southampton Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the coronavirus testing system, saying it is trying to meet a ""colossal spike"" in demand. It comes as the government said it wasdrawing up a list setting out who will be prioritised for tests. Care home residents and staff are likely to be near the top of the list, as Mr Johnson acknowledged ministers were concerned about infection rates. The PM told MPs a new ""action plan"" for care homes will be released this week. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said schools could be considered for priority testing. On Wednesday, coronavirus cases in the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219,according to figures from the government.,external A further 20 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This brings the UK death total by this criteria to 41,684. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts Mr Johnson said 89% of those who have in-person tests get them the next day. He told Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: ""I think most people looking at the record of this country in delivering tests across this nation will see that it actually compares extremely well with any other European country."" The PM had promised that all in-person test results would be back within 24 hours by the end of June. He acknowledged the frustration around the demand for tests, but said capacity was being increased, with the government wanting 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. Mr Johnson admitted ""we are concerned about the rates of infection in care homes"" and promised a new action plan for the sector would be released this week. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs as Sir Keir was self-isolating due to a family member showing symptoms and awaiting the results of a test, which has since been returned as negative. She told MPs Mr Johnson needed to ""get some skates on"" to address the issues. ""Those care workers are still not getting the PPE they need, they're still not getting the testing they need,"" she said. This video can not be played Angela Rayner accuses the PM of blaming others for his âincompetence"" with ""no plan"" for a second coronavirus wave Ms Rayner also said the prime minister had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing, but ""then breaks those promises"". ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises,"" she said. ""The health secretary said yesterday it would take weeks to sort this situation out. We don't have weeks."" Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Breakfast thatplans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Robert Buckland said. He also said testing centres would be increasing from about 400 to 500 in the next few weeks. Elsewhere,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said each school could, from today, order more testing kits, having each been given 10 at the start of term. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings and beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Test slots are limited because, while there seem to be enough testing sites, there are bottlenecks in labs for processing swabs, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. A new lab is due to be up and running but that could be a few weeks away - and until thenministers say current problems are likely to continue. Bolton NHS Trust in Greater Manchester said thatmore than 100 people had turned up to accident and emergencyon Tuesday asking for a test. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're working around the clock to make sure everyone who needs a test can get a test"" Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons on Tuesday it was ""less than a day's capacity"". That means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. The Department of Health has said about a quarter of people requesting tests have no need to do so - and only those with relevant symptoms should book. Some closed for a period days after reopening while others have told classes and whole year groups - many of which form one bubble  - to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Teaching unions have called for the education sector to be prioritised for the allocation of tests to ensure schools remain open. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said if issues with testing capacity were not fixed keeping schools open would become ""unsustainable"". Nearly 300 pupils sent home after positive test School figures show 88% back for start of term Can my child go to school with a cold? Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on Wednesday he had emphasised the importance of prioritising schools to Baroness Harding, head of the UK testing system. Cafe owners Scott Vining and his wife worry testing delays mean they will have to close their family business Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" 'How am I supposed to get my family of eight tested?'

TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according to government figures for Monday. The government said its UK laboratory daily testing capacity was more than 370,000 as of last week - which includes antibody tests and those tests used by scientists to estimate how widespread the virus is. Testing capacity (excluding antibody tests and virus spread testing) is about 245,000 a day. Government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic, The aim is to increase capacity to 500,000 a day by the end of October. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. Analysis from Our World In Data, a research team based at the University of Oxford, suggests the UK is now performing more tests than many other countries. For example, the seven-day average up until 10 September showed the UK had carried out 2.8 tests per 1,000 people. This was ahead of European countries including France (2.1) and Spain and Germany (both 1.8). TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected? RETURN TO FILMING:How has filming EastEnders changed?

"Test centres in Bolton have seen long queues as people try to get tested More than 100 people turned up at an A&E asking for Covid-19 tests, sparking a plea from a hospital trust for anyone who was not seriously ill to stay away. Bolton NHS Trust said dozens of people went to Royal Bolton Hospital because they could not get into test centres. The trust says it shows NHS Test and Trace is ""failing"" but the government insists it is ""working"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and firefighters could soon be used as contact tracers. It would provide more ""rigour"" to the national system, he said. Bolton had the highest infection rate in England with 204 cases per 100,000 people recorded in the week to 13 September. The total number of cases rose from 437 up until 6 September to 587 a week later. The government said people who were not eligible were requesting tests The trust's medical director Dr Francis Andrews, said people should only go to hospital if they were ""extremely unwell or referred by your GP"". ""We are extremely busy in our emergency department as a result of this increase,"" he said. ""Only attend this department if you have experienced a life-threatening accident or illness and need urgent medical attention."" Meanwhile, Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan made a similar plea to stay away from A&E. ""We are receiving a high volume of patients coming to A&E requesting a COVID-19 test,"" it said in a post on its Facebook page. And Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has urged parents not to bring children to its emergency department for a Covid-19 test after a ""big increase"" in people asking for tests there. Bolton NHS Trust Chairwoman Prof Donna Hall said the government's approach was ""failing"". Prof Hall said the situation now was different to the one in March when they had extra staff drafted in and were not expected to continue with planned operations. ""This failure of the test-and-trace system is placing huge pressure on the NHS and social care,"" she said. ""We had 100 people in our accident and emergency unit. ""We've now got 30 people who are Covid-positive and we've got five people in our high-dependency unit so this virus is not going away. She said she felt there had been a lack of a cohesive strategy for both the containment of the virus and for the test and trace system. Lancashire's director of public health said the system was at ""breaking point"" and was ""compromising our ability to stop the transmission"". Teacher Simon Foster says the testing system was an ""absolute mess"" Teacher Simon Foster said he developed a cough overnight and, because of his job teaching children with special needs - many of whom have diabetes - he needs to be tested . ""I have tried all day to book an appointment and I still don't have one,"" he said. ""It's an absolute mess."" ""It keeps saying there was nothing available [and] there were no tests they could send by post either."" ""I hope it is just a cough.... I can't go back to work until I get tested."" Dr Sakthi Karunanithi said it was ""beyond frustrating"", adding: ""The issue is lab capacity. ""We have our own community testing sites and were doing about 200 tests a day - [on Tuesday] we did 1,639 tests. We can't go on like this."" Bolton Council said a test centre had been due to open on Saturday at the Last Drop Village Hotel, in response to the growing number of cases, but was delayed when ""an external business"" failed to turn up. A spokesman said although the delay had been ""out of our hands"", the authority was ""working with the government and their partners to find out what has happened"". Mr Burnham said 46% of named contacts were not being traced in Greater Manchester. He said 100 police community support officers (PCSOs) and 100 fire officers would set up a unit to help contact people not being reached. ""It can't be the case going forwards that we fail to fix test, trace and isolate and just introduce blanket restrictions. I don't think people will accept that,"" he said. ""We think more rigour in contact tracing, quality contact with people and support to self isolate would help improve the system."" Powers to bring in ""targeted"" restrictions, like changing a specific pub or supermarket's opening hours, were also being sought, Deputy Mayor Bev Hughes added. Steve Rumbelow, the chief executive at nearby Rochdale Council,Â told theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicethere had been a ""noticeable change"" in people's behaviour across Greater Manchester and the testing system was in ""meltdown"". He said it was ""largely"" because people were unable to get tested. ""It's not massive numbers, I don't want to over-egg it, but [it] indicates that people are starting to get concerned,"" he said. ""Test and trace is pretty much in meltdown. ""It's a major concern, and the way tests are being rationed is just not sustainable for containing the virus effectively going forward."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said NHS Test and Trace was ""working"", adding the system was ""processing a million tests a week, but we are seeing significant demand for tests, including from people who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible"". He said anyone with an appointment would not be turned away, and new booking slots and home testing kits were being made available daily.

"A second national lockdown would be likely to have ""disastrous"" financial consequences for the UK, the prime minister has said.

""So when I see people arguing against the rule of six or saying that the government is coming in too hard on individual liberties and so on - I totally understand that and I sympathise with that, but we must, must defeat this disease."" From Monday,new rules came into force, restricting indoor and outdoor gatherings in England and Scotland, and indoor groups in Wales. A second national lockdown is extremely unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, it is hugely damaging - to the economy, to education and to wider health for reasons other than Covid. You only need to look at the latest figures for falling cancer referrals, the hours spent out of school and the rising unemployment to see the cost of the UK's spring lockdown. Secondly, the government and its medical advisers have a much better grasp of the virus. Current infection rates and hospitalisations remain much lower than they were in the spring and, despite the problems with testing, there is pretty rich data on exactly where the virus is and how quickly it is spreading. Even if things get worse, officials are quite confident the NHS will cope. But that does not mean there won't be further restrictions - or that it won't be a very difficult winter with a high number of deaths. The ban of gatherings of more than six people could be just the first step. There is also talk of curfews, forcing hospitality venues to close at 22:00 BST. This tactic was used in Belgium to curb the rise in cases, and has been deployed to tackle the outbreak in Bolton. At this stage, it is unlikely this will be used nationally. Instead, expect it to be an option for virus hotspots, along with banning visits to other people's housing which has been used in the North West and West Yorkshire. Shielding could, though, be re-introduced across the country at some point, along with bans on visits to care homes, in an attempt to protect the most vulnerable groups. Mr Johnson also admitted there was not enough coronavirus testing capacity amid reports of people struggling to get tests and results being delayed. He told the committee: ""We don't have enough testing capacity now because, in an ideal world, I would like to test absolutely everybody that wants a test immediately."" He promised there would be capacity for 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. But he urged people without symptoms to stay away from testing centres - although he acknowledged why they may want to find out if they had Covid-19. ""What has happened is demand has massively accelerated just in the last couple of weeks,"" he said. Earlier, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who stood in for Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions, said Mr Johnson had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing, but ""then breaks those promises"". ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises,"" she said. This video can not be played Angela Rayner stood in for Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions MPs at the liaison committee also asked the prime minister about his aim of having a ""pregnancy-style test"" in place within months, which would have a role in fulfilling his""Operation Moonshot""ambition for mass testing. The government has said it Â£500m has been set aside to invest in its mass testing plans. Mr Johnson said: ""I am going to be cautious and say that I can't sit here today and say that we have such a 'pregnancy-style test'... today. ""It is right for government to invest in such a project."" YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Committee chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin told Mr Johnson musicians, singers and performers had ""fallen through the cracks of the support schemes available"". Mr Johnson said the best way to help the sector was to ""get these businesses going again and to get the theatres lit again, by having the virus down and having a testing regime that allows us to do that"". He also said an inquiry into the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic would ""look at everything that has gone wrong and gone right"". But he said it would not be a ""good use of official time at the moment"" and declined to indicate when the inquiry could begin. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland saidplans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days,. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Mr Buckland said. Resolving delays with testing was ""the number one issue"", he added.

"The government is facing criticism over its ""world-beating"" coronavirus testing system after people reported struggles to get tests, including being offered slots at testing sites a long way away. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and various cabinet members have been defending the scheme, and have claimed that testing capacity is increasing and that the average trip to get tested isn't that far. We've looked at five of their claims. The health secretary made this claim in the House of Commons - last week, he said the average distance was 6.4 miles. Initially, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not release the data on this - despite our repeated requests to see it.Now it has released some of it.,external It supports Mr Hancock's claims. It states that the median distance travelled (that's the point at which half the trips were shorter and half longer) in England in the last week was 5.8 miles. This was down from 6.4 miles the previous week. It also shows that the 5% of people travelled more than 47 miles away for a test - that would make a round-trip of 94 miles.How far are people travelling to get tested? It counts trips made to regional test centres, local walk-ins and mobile test units. What's going wrong with coronavirus testing? How do I get a coronavirus test? Not enough tests for five months, study predicts It doesn't supply the numbers of people butwe know 360,000 tests were processed from these sites,externalin the latest week. 5% of this figure would be around 18,000 people who travelled nearly 50 miles to a test centre (although some may have got more than one test). The data also shows that most people (75%) travelled around 13 miles each way. The DHSC has also given us details about how it worked the distances out. It uses a straight line from someone's location to the test site ""as the crow flies"". But this doesn't take into account that most roads are not in a straight line between the two points - so average distance actually travelled will be higher. For example, if someone was to drive between the BBC offices in central London and the Wembley testing facility, the exact distance between the two is 5.5 miles (8.9km). However, once you take into account the actual roads, this increases to about eight miles. Finally, the data only records people who booked a test. It doesn't tell us how many tried to get one, decided the one they were offered was too far away and didn't take it. As of 30 August, the UK had processed just over 15m antigen tests, - the ones which tell you whether you currently have coronavirus. This total is higher than any other country in Europe, according to data collected by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency. Their figures show that, by this date: Germany processed 12.3m tests France processed 7.4m tests Comparisons between countries will not always be perfect, because some countries report less often and there might be some differences in methodology. A coronavirus testing centre in Cologne's Rautenstrauch Joest museum Boris Johnson has also claimed that the UK is testing more per head of population than France, Germany and Spain. Looking at this measure allows for differences in population size between countries. Mr Johnson is right - according to ECDC data on tests per 1,000 people for the week ending 30 August: UK - 19 tests per 1,000 France - 13 tests per 1,000 Germany - 13 tests per 1,000 Spain - 12 tests per 1,000 The data also shows that four European countries rank higher than the UK, including Denmark on 42 tests per 1,000. The home secretary is correct that government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. For example, on 10 September, labs in the UK would have been able to process 244,000 antigen tests, which indicate if you currently have the virus, but processed 204,000. This means, in theory, labs could have processed results for 40,000 more tests. Last week, Sarah-Jane Marsh, a director of the government's test-and-trace programme in England, confirmed there was a problem with the labs, offering a ""heartfelt apology"" to those who couldn't get a test. ""All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded, it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point,"" she said. Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but on Tuesday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the backlog was ""less than a day's capacity"". This means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. He added that this has been driven by a surge in demand as children go back to school and adults return to work. We have asked the government why - in a system with more lab capacity than actual tests carried out - there is a backlog, but have had no response. The latest test return times in England we have, are for the week to 9 September - the figure is actually for people getting results within 24 hours rather than the next day. The figure Mr Johnson appears to be referring to is the proportion of test results published within 24 hours of them being received by a laboratory -it was 88.8% according to the latest figures,external. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health But this excludes the time it takes to get the test to the lab, and it's for pillar 1 tests, which are for people with a clinical need and are processed in Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals. For pillar 2 tests,the ones for the wider population and run by private labs,external, the median turnaround time from taking a test at a regional test site to getting the result was 27 hours, which means half of tests took longer than that, and half took less time. For mobile testing units that figure was 26 hours, but for satellite testing centres it was 97 hours. Satellite tests are ones which are processed by private labs and sent to places like care homes or hospitals. The government says tests in these settings are often conducted over multiple days. This means that someone might take a test a few days before it is collected. Outside permanent drive-through testing sites, people can also get testing kits delivered to their home or visit mobile testing sites, which move around according to demand. Ms Patel is correct that there has been an increase in both of these, doubling in number since the end of May. It is difficult to confirm whether more tests are taking place in lockdown areas because - again - the government does not release this data by local authority. We also don't know how many people have asked for tests but have not been able to get them when they want them. On 15 September, the health secretary said 9,278 Pillar 2 - or commercially run - tests were carried out in the top 10 most affected areas of the country. That equates to about 7.5% of all tests on an average day. These 10 areas make up 5% of the population, meaning they received proportionally more tests.

"The widespread introduction of Covid marshals to towns and cities in England is ""unlikely"" and ""almost impossible"", some local authorities have said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested themarshals would enforce rules about social distancing, gathering in groups and wearing masks. But a lack of detail has been criticised by council and health officials. Questions about funding, recruitment and enforcement powers remain. Local authorities ""are best placed to determine the model of deployment and responsibilities of marshals in their areas"" and ""further details will be set out in due course"", a government spokesman said. But Bob Cook, leader of Stockton Council, said theannouncement had ""caused a lot of confusion"". ""We've had no answers to any of these questions. It's a very strange way of doing things,"" Mr Cook said. ""Things would be a lot clearer if the government would actually talk to local councils before making such announcements."" Mr Johnson has said marshals could also be volunteers or current members of council staff. A Cheshire East spokesman said any new responsibilities would ""have to be fully funded by Whitehall"", while Southend's public safety councillor, Martin Terry, said: ""We can't do things out of thin air. The government has to put money on the table."" Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes complained authorities were given just days to hire and train the marshals ""with no extra funding or resources to help"" and accused the government of ""serial incompetence"". Spokespeople for Lewisham, North Yorkshire and Swindon councils have also said they need more information about what marshals are actually expected to do, what powers they will have, how they will be paid for. The prime minister has also been criticised for the manner of the announcement. Lewisham Council's cabinet member for finance, Amanda DeRyk, said she learned about the plans on the radio. ""You're like, hang on a minute, that's the first we've heard,"" she said. ""There's this sort of policy of decision making by sensational announcement. I heard that on [Radio 4's] the Today Programme"". The Local Government Association said: ""Even if marshals were rolled out in great numbers, they will not have enforcement powers so it is important that residents do not expect councils to be able to act when they cannot"" and ""any new responsibilities for councils in this area will have to be fully funded"". A few areas of the country - including Leeds and Cornwall - have already introduced marshals to give ""friendly help and guidance"".

"Cheaper restaurant meals due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme saw prices rise at their slowest rate in five years. The UK's inflation rate,external, which tracks the prices of goods and services, fell to 0.2% in August, from 1% in July. Low inflation - the rate at which prices of everyday goods and services rise - is good for consumers and borrowers, but can be bad for savers. That is because while it makes things cheaper, it also affects the interest rates set by banks and other firms. The eating out scheme, which ran from Monday to Wednesday in August, offered 50% off food up to the value of Â£10. Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed through the scheme. Prices in restaurants and cafes were 2.6% lower than in August last year, the first time they had been negative since records began in 1989, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The cut to the rate of value added tax (VAT) also helped drive prices lower, it added. The discount, from 20% to 5%, lasts until 12 January next year, was introduced on food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. Restaurateur Paul Sharma Paul Sharma, owner of the newly established 2020 World Buffet restaurant in Peterborough, is extremely grateful to the government for the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. He first opened his doors to customers on 16 March, just before lockdown, but after a mere four days, he had to shut up shop. When he reopened, he had to reduce the restaurant's capacity of 450 to just 170 to follow social distancing measures, but he was fully booked and able to seat 1,000 people a day by opening right through the day. ""We had many, many thousands of customers,"" he told the BBC, adding that the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was ""massively helpful"". ""It's one of the best things the government has done for small businesses,"" he said. ""We could pay the salaries of our staff, we could pay all the outstanding bills that were pending since March. ""We're going to survive for the next few months and then hopefully, in the course of time, the virus will go away and then things will get normal."" The cost of clothing and footwear also fell significantly. And in an indication of the severe effect of the pandemic on travel and tourism, air fares dropped in price as fewer people travelled abroad because of quarantine restrictions. The ONS said this was unprecedented for August, which is usually the peak month of the holiday season. ""The cost of dining out fell significantly in August thanks to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and VAT cut, leading to one of the largest falls in the annual inflation rate in recent years,"" said ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow. ""For the first time since records began, air fares fell in August as fewer people travelled abroad on holiday. Meanwhile, the usual clothing price rises seen at this time of year, as autumn ranges hit the shops, also failed to materialise."" It was the lowest inflation rate since December 2015. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. A five-year low in the rise in consumer prices reflects the extraordinary action taken to try to get Brits back into town centres. The fall to 0.2% is overwhelmingly the result of the impact of Eat Out to Help Out and the temporary VAT cut for the hospitality sector. It is a statistic that reaffirms what we already know, but also reflects some freakishly temporary factors. The chancellor's restaurant subsidy scheme is already over, the VAT cuts expire in January. Inflation is likely to remain lower than its 2% target, except in the case of a further sharp fall in the value of the pound - for example, after a disorderly end to the post-Brexit trade talks. Either way, the Bank of England has more space for extra support to the economy in the coming months, without risking a surge in inflation. Probably not. Before the latest figures were published, there had been fears that the UK inflation rate might turn negative, giving rise to what is known as deflation. Economists fear deflation because falling prices lead to lower consumer spending, as shoppers put off big purchases in the expectation that they will get cheaper still. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said August's figure was probably ""the low point"" for inflation, but pointed out that it was unlikely to hit the Bank of England's 2% target within the next few years. ""The big picture is that it will be a few years before the economy is strong enough to sustain CPI inflation at the 2% target,"" he said. ""The big risk to this view is a no-deal Brexit, which could cause a slump in the pound and, in turn, a temporary sharp rise in inflation to above 3.5%."" Not necessarily. Although prices went up very little in August, a look at the figures over the past three months shows that on average, inflation has outstripped growth in pay. Inflation is calculated by looking at a ""basket"" of commonly purchased goods and comparing how much they cost now with last month and with the same time last year. During the pandemic, the ONS has been unable to identify prices for many of the 720 items it usually monitors. In August, the ONS said prices for only eight items were still unavailable, reflecting parts of the economy still unable to operate normally including cruises, live music, theatre, swimming pools and soft play sessions.

"The UK government's law officer for Scotland, Lord Keen, has resigned amid a legal row over Brexit legislation. The advocate general said he had ""found it increasingly difficult to reconcile"" his obligations as a lawyer with provisions in the Internal Market Bill. Ministers have admitted that their plans could ""break international law"". Lord Keen's resignation was initially not accepted by Downing Street, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying that conversations were ongoing. However it was later confirmed that he had left his post. The government's most senior lawyer - Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the government legal department -had already resigned over the bill, which passed its first parliamentary test on Monday. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis hastold MPs the legislation could break international lawby overriding the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. Lord Keen initially tried to defend the legislation, arguing that Mr Lewis had ""essentially answered the wrong question"". He told the House of Lords that his view was that ""the bill does not of itself constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law"". But the Northern Ireland secretary later doubled down, saying that his statement was a ""very straight answer"" which was ""absolutely in line"" with legal advice. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says he gave the âcorrectâ answer when he was asked if the Internal Market Bill would break international law. In his resignation letter, Lord Keen said it had been a ""privilege"" to serve as advocate general for Scotland, but said that the government ""faces challenges on a number of fronts and I fear that the internal market bill in its present form will not make these any easier"". He added: ""Over the past week I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a law officer with your policy intentions with respect to the Internal Markets Bill. ""I have endeavoured to identify a respectable argument for the provisions at clauses 42 to 45 of the bill, but it is now clear that this will not meet your policy intentions. ""In these circumstances I consider that it is my duty to tender my resignation from your government."" Mr Johnson had said discussions about Lord Keen's future were ""continuing"" on Wednesday afternoon when he appeared before the Commons Liaison Committee. But shortly after the committee concluded, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that the advocate general had left his post and thanked him for his service. The BBC understands Mr Johnsonhas already struck a deal with potential Tory rebelsover the legislation, which would give MPs ""an extra layer of parliamentary oversight"". Richard Keen had been the chairman of the Scottish Conservatives until being appointed as Advocate General in 2015 - when he was also made a life peer as Baron Keen of Elie. The QC has represented the UK government in court in a number of high-profile cases, including over the prorogation of parliament in 2019 and the ""Article 50"" Brexit case in 2016-17. As a law officer in the UK government, Lord Keen had been defending plans to give ministers powers to change the EU withdrawal agreement in the event that the two sides can't agree a trade deal. He argued that while this part of the UK internal market bill creates tension with the UK's international obligations, that is not unprecedented and that domestic law should prevail. The trouble is, the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has already said that overriding the Brexit divorce deal would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" and he's rejected Lord Keen's suggestion that he'd answered incorrectly. That made it increasingly difficult for Lord Keen to reconcile the government's plans with the law and he wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday morning offering his resignation. Lord Keen is the first member of the government to quit over its approach to this issue, which has drawn criticism from former attorneys general and all five living former prime ministers. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But some senior Conservatives - including former Prime Minister John Major - have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards. This video can not be played Leyen: UK and EU ""jointly agreed"" on withdrawal agreement Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen has warned the UK cannot unilaterally set aside the withdrawal agreement. She said on Wednesday the agreement was the only way to guarantee the Northern Ireland peace process, and warned that its replacement would undermine trust in the UK. PM defends planned Brexit deal changes What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Last week marked the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto generic World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached.

"There is fear in India as Covid-19 cases continue to surge In India, relentlessly rising case numbers are causing another emergency - serious mental health problems among Covid-19 patients, writes the BBC's Vikas Pandey. Rajesh Tiwari, 42, has developed a serious phobia of any screen which is bigger than his mobile phone. He thinks big screens, especially TV sets and computer monitors, are giant creatures who can attack him. Mr Tiwari began experiencing hallucinations after a long stay in an intensive care unit. In early June he had tested positive for coronavirus and he was admitted to a private hospital as his condition worsened. Five days later he was put on a ventilator. Mr Tiwari recovered after nearly three weeks in the hospital. But he soon realised that his recovery was not complete. ""I am better now because I sought treatment, but the first few weeks after my discharge from the hospital were very difficult,"" he said in an interview. Many cities have been struggling to cope with the rise in cases Mr Tiwari's family was elated to bring him home, but after a while they realised that everything was not right with him. One day, he screamed at the TV set and attempted to smash it. The family had to stop watching TV and nobody was allowed to use laptops at home. Mr Tiwari said he was struggling to forget the images of monitors constantly beeping and flashing numbers in the ICU. Amit Sharma and his family had a similar experience. Mr Sharma, 49, spent 18 days in the ICU and saw people die every day. Young and old, men and women - all kinds of Covid-19 patients were dying around him. ""One day, two patients around me died and their bodies were there for several hours,"" he said. ""I just can't get those images out of my head. I still fear Covid might kill me."" Mr Sharma is struggling to forget the traumatic experience. He became very quiet at home after his recovery, his uncle said. ""And whenever he talked, it was always about the patients he had seen dying in the Covid ward,"" he said. ICU is most of India's hospitals have been flooded with Covid patients Many recovering coronavirus patients in India are experiencing mental health distress, said Dr Vasant Mundra, a senior psychiatrist at Mumbai's PD Hinduja hospital, particularly those who were on a ventilator or spent a long time in an ICU. ""The brain is already exhausted by the time you get to the hospital. And then the mayhem of the Covid wards overwhelms your senses,"" Dr Mundra said. Covid-19 patients are not allowed to meet family and they don't get to see the faces of their doctors and nurses, who are wearing protective masks at all times. That was disrupting patients' ability to form trust with their doctor, said Dr A Fathahudeen, the head of the critical care department at Ernakulam Medical College in southern India, in turn disrupting their recovery. Recovery from coronavirus can be a lonely experience, and doctors say when a patient experiences life threatening events as well the chance of post traumatic stress drastically increases. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and hallucinations, Dr Mundra said. And yet, mental health issues associated with coronavirus patients are not getting enough attention, doctors warn. There are few mentions in government press conferences or in the media. Prominent mental health expert Dr Soumitra Pathare said he was not surprised. ""What you are seeing during the pandemic is a reflection of India's poor investment in mental health facilities,"" he said. India lacks facilities and experts to treat mental health patients, and the situation is worse in smaller towns where people are often not able even to recognise symptoms. Millions of people in India have lost their jobs during the pandemic Much of India's mental health treatment infrastructure is concentrated in cities, leaving 80%-90% of the population with little or no access to mental health specialists, said Dr Pathare - adding that the gap is becoming clearer during the pandemic. If the government failed to recognise and address the problem soon India would be facing a ""mental health pandemic"", he said. A good starting point would be making people more aware of symptoms, Dr Pathare said. And the next step would be to improve mental health facilities, especially in smaller towns. ""I am aware it won't happen overnight, but we have to start somewhere,"" he said. Doctors are working in special Covid-19 wards across the country Kamna Chhibber, the head of the mental health department at Fortis hospital in Delhi, said she had witnessed a sharp rise in the number of people reaching out for help during the pandemic. A long lockdown, uncertainty over the future, and the need to be constantly alert had made people more anxious, and more people were coming to the hospital to talk generally about anxiety and depression, Ms Chhibber said. The problem was becoming ""more serious with each passing day"", she said. Doctors are now urging for mental health to be addressed as part of post-Covid treatment protocols. Each hospital needed to do something, said Dr Fathahudeen, or ""we may save people from Covid but lose them to depression and PTSD"". The names of the patients have been changed to protect their identities.

"Schools are back, businesses are reopening and winter bugs are starting to spread - meaning more and more people are asking for a coronavirus test. Three families explain how the testing problems are affecting them. Maria Aziz, from west London, has been trying to book a test since Sunday, when her nine-year-old daughter, Mishal, complained of a sore throat. By 04:00 Monday, her daughter had developed a fever. ""I had been trying all of Sunday to try and get a test. I must have tried between seven and 10 times,"" she told the BBC. ""And then yesterday I probably tried about four times at various intervals across the day, starting early in the morning and ending late at night."" After again trying and failing to book a test today, she said she's frustrated. Her eldest daughter, Eimann, 14, has also had to be withdrawn from school while she tries to book a test for her younger daughter. Who should get tested and how do I get one? What are the coronavirus symptoms? ""Even if I have to drive 100 miles to get a test, I'd rather get her tested than not have a test,"" she said. ""If she has it, then that's fine. We will know we need to continue self-isolating. But if she doesn't then it's unfair on my older daughter. She's missed enough school already. ""I'm trying through the government website and then yesterday there was also a number on the website to call - 119 - so I tried that as well. Each time there were no tests available. No home kits. No walk-in slots. No drive-through slots. Nothing. ""It's very frustrating. They've just about managed a week of school before they've had to be off again. It would be good to know one way or the other."" Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family, the spaces had disappeared. ""This is the problem I've found,"" he said. ""When you're doing it for a family of four, either no tests were available at all or after a while it kept taking you right back to the start to put all your details in again. Testing problems will be resolved 'in weeks' - Hancock Coronavirus testing system 'falling over' ""In the end, I just put my wife's details in because she's the most important one to get back to work."" Scott managed to secure a test for his wife today in Luton. He has since managed to book tests for himself and his children at a separate testing centre, in Bedford. ""Both the walk-in centre in Luton and the drive-in car park in Bedford were empty,"" he said. ""The walk-in centre had at least 12 available test booths with only three people there. The drive-in had space for maybe 30 cars. There was only one other car there."" If it happens again, however, the small cafe the family runs may have to close. The business only survived lockdown with the help of a crowd-funding drive and a grant. ""We've only got my wife and another member of staff there. She wouldn't be able to run it on her own so we would have to shut,"" he said. ""Inevitably, kids are going to come home from school with sniffles and colds. We have to shut our business because of that,"" he said. ""So it's not really worth sending the kids in if this going to happen again. We have to really think about it."" The government says anyone can get a test if they have coronavirus symptoms - namely a high temperature, a new or continuous cough, and/or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste You can also get a test for someone you live with if they have these symptoms But you should not get a test or ask for tests for people you live with who do not have Covid-19 symptoms If you have symptoms or test positive, you should remain at home for at least 10 days Other members of your household, including those who do not have any symptoms, should then also stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days Source:UK government testing guidance,external As a family of eight, not everyone has been able to get tested For larger families, it's not just testing availability that can be an issue. ""It's an absolute nightmare trying to navigate the website as a family of eight,"" Christina Fox, from Stockton on Tees, said. The family was advised to book a test after phoning 111 when Christina's seven-year-old daughter developed a high fever and a cough. After trying for seven hours on Sunday, they had managed to secure three tests - for her seven-year-old, whose symptoms were worst, for another daughter who works for NHS 111 and couldn't return before testing negative, and for herself. ""We had the app open on my phone, my daughter's phone and on the computer,"" Ms Fox said. ""It really is like a pot of gold. You have to be there at the right time, the right second, and suddenly a test might appear."" Despite those test results coming back negative, other family members have now developed symptoms, so they have had to continue to isolate. ""We managed to get two more tests this morning,"" Christina said. ""Because my 12-year-old goes to a different school to the younger kids, when I rang this morning they indicated that I should really be getting her tested. ""It's just ridiculous. If they want kids back at school and college and they want the economy to start running again they need to make the provisions for proper testing."" Agovernment spokespersonsaid it was ""processing more than a million tests a week and we recently announced new facilities and technology to process results even faster. ""If you do not have symptoms and are not eligible to get a test you can continue to protect yourself if you wash your hands, wear a face covering and follow social distancing rules.""

"People queue for tests in Southampton Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the coronavirus testing system, saying it is trying to meet a ""colossal spike"" in demand. It comes as the government said it wasdrawing up a list setting out who will be prioritised for tests. Care home residents and staff are likely to be near the top of the list, as Mr Johnson acknowledged ministers were concerned about infection rates. The PM told MPs a new ""action plan"" for care homes will be released this week. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said schools could be considered for priority testing. On Wednesday, coronavirus cases in the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219,according to figures from the government.,external A further 20 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19.

All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts Mr Johnson said 89% of those who have in-person tests get them the next day. He told Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: ""I think most people looking at the record of this country in delivering tests across this nation will see that it actually compares extremely well with any other European country."" The PM had promised that all in-person test results would be back within 24 hours by the end of June. He acknowledged the frustration around the demand for tests, but said capacity was being increased, with the government wanting 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. Mr Johnson admitted ""we are concerned about the rates of infection in care homes"" and promised a new action plan for the sector would be released this week. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs as Sir Keir was self-isolating due to a family member showing symptoms and awaiting the results of a test, which has since been returned as negative. She told MPs Mr Johnson needed to ""get some skates on"" to address the issues.

This video can not be played Angela Rayner accuses the PM of blaming others for his âincompetence"" with ""no plan"" for a second coronavirus wave Ms Rayner also said the prime minister had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing, but ""then breaks those promises"". ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises,"" she said. ""The health secretary said yesterday it would take weeks to sort this situation out. We don't have weeks."" Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Breakfast thatplans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Robert Buckland said. He also said testing centres would be increasing from about 400 to 500 in the next few weeks. Elsewhere,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said each school could, from today, order more testing kits, having each been given 10 at the start of term. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings and beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Test slots are limited because, while there seem to be enough testing sites, there are bottlenecks in labs for processing swabs, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. A new lab is due to be up and running but that could be a few weeks away - and until thenministers say current problems are likely to continue.

Some closed for a period days after reopening while others have told classes and whole year groups - many of which form one bubble  - to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Teaching unions have called for the education sector to be prioritised for the allocation of tests to ensure schools remain open.

"This video can not be played Asked if the EU is negotiating a trade deal with the UK in good faith, Boris Johnson says: âI donât believe they areâ. No 10 has reached a deal with some of the Tory MPs unhappy with plans to give the government the power to override parts of the UK's Brexit agreement. Boris Johnson has agreed to amend the Internal Market Bill, giving MPs a vote before he could use the powers in it that would break international law. The move could head off a potential rebellion over the issue next week. But Labour said the UK was on course to break its word, as a senior government legal officer quit over the issue. Lord Keen, Scotland's Advocate General,stood downon Wednesday after days of speculation about his future. In his resignation letter, he told the PM: ""I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a Law Officer with your policy intentions."" Kuenssberg: No 10 not backing down Law officer offers resignation over Brexit bill How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? The peer, who served in the Ministry of Justice, objected to proposed legislation which would allow the government to override parts of the EU withdrawal agreement, in contravention of international law. But less than a hour after his exit was confirmed, Downing Street said it had reached a compromise with two critics of sections of the bill, ex-justice minister Sir Bob Neill and former work and pensions secretary Damian Green. Agovernment amendment,externalto the bill, published on Thursday, would prevent ministers from activating powers in the bill to override the Brexit divorce deal until MPs had voted to approve it first. The provision is similar to the changes to the bill proposed by Sir Bob, who will now drop his planned amendment. Ministers have also tabled amendments to place a time-limit on attempts to question the legality of controversial sections of the bill via judicial review. Tonight's compromise - some would say U-turn - between Downing Street and potential Conservative rebels appears to have solved one short-term problem. It staves off the prospect of a serious, if not fatal, show of high-profile dissent next week when MPs debate the specific clauses of the bill that would breach international law. The ""parliamentary lock"" would allow MPs as a whole, and not just ministers, to decide whether to press the political equivalent of the nuclear button. It is thought MPs may be less likely to do so. But this compromise won't be enough to stop the bill being potentially savaged in the Lords. Eminent peers with a background in the legal profession maintain that it is still wrong to legislate with the intention of breaking international law. They will be bolstered by Lord Keen's resignation - as he has made it clear that he couldn't reconcile his responsibilities as a law officer with the government's policy. And Brussels is insisting that the clauses which override part of the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland should be removed entirely. Otherwise the EU could take the UK government to court. In a joint statement with No 10, Mr Green - head of a centrist group of Tory MPs - said: ""The Internal Market Bill was designed to give MPs and peers a vote on the use of these powers via statutory instrument. ""But following talks, it is agreed that the Parliamentary procedure suggested by some colleagues provides a clearer, more explicit democratic mandate for the use of these powers, and also provides more legal certainty."" The statement claims that on the Tory benches there is ""near-unanimous agreement that the government must be able to use these powers as a final resort, that there must be legal certainty, and that no further amendments are required on these powers"". Mr Green urged the government to focus on settling the terms of its future economic partnership with the bloc before the 15 October deadline set by the PM. Allow Twitter content?

Senior Tory backbencher Sir Roger Gale, who hadthreatenedto vote against the bill unless it was changed, welcomed the government's plans to amend it. In a tweet on Thursday, he wrote: ""Good that Bob Neill's amendment, which I endorsed, has effectively been accepted. ""At least Parliament will now have the chance to vote again if the government proposes to change the withdrawal agreement."" The bill has provoked a backlash from the EU, which has threatened legal action - and the possible suspension of trade talks - if the measures overriding the withdrawal agreement are not withdrawn. And Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said his party would continue opposing the legislation. Responding to the joint statement on Wednesday he said: ""This does not fix the problem of breaking the law, damaging our reputation around the world and damaging our future prosperity. ""We need a trade deal with Europe and that is what we were promised. Breaking our own word and the treaty the prime minister signed puts that at risk."" Defending the bill on Wednesday during an appearance before a committee of senior MPs, Mr Johnson said he believed the EU may not be negotiating with the UK in good faith over the agreement's implementation. Pressed by Labour's Hilary Benn on whether he thought the EU was negotiating in good faith, he said: ""I don't believe they are."" This contradicted Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who earlier told MPs he believed the EU was acting in good faith. When that was put to him, Mr Johnson said it was ""always possible that I am mistaken and perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong"". Both sides have a duty to act in good faith under Article 5 of the withdrawal agreement - but it is difficult to demonstrate a lack of ""good faith"" or ""best endeavours"" - another phrase enshrined in the treaty. The legal definition of ""good faith"" is stronger than the generally accepted meaning of the words. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards.

"There is no need for British Airways to lay off cabin crew and then rehire them on inferior terms, boss Alex Cruz has said. Unions and MPs had accused the airline of following a ""fire and rehire"" policy, which saw some employees facing pay cuts of up to 50%. But Mr Cruz told MPs ""there will be no need to issue new contracts"", subject to staff approval. BA reached the outline of a jobs agreement with union Unite last week. The pair have been in a bitter dispute over BA's plans to shed up to 13,000 jobs and cut pay, amid a collapse in demand for air travel. Speaking to the Transport Select Committee, Mr Cruz said it was a matter of ""regret"" that it took 73 days for BA's non-pilot unions to sit down and negotiate. But Labour MP Sam Tarry responded: ""I would argue that if you hadn't put a metaphorical gun to their head then that might not have happened."" This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Mr Cruz said the airline would now follow the ""standard methodology"" of union agreements and make amendments to existing contracts. Details are still being worked out and ballots of some staff are yet to be held. Long-serving cabin crew members face a 15% pay reduction, while hoping to retain many of the allowances which constitute a significant part of their overall pay. ""We have reached agreements in a majority of areas,"" Mr Cruz said. ""We very much hope that the result of the ballots will be to accept those ballots."" In relation to whether or not BA will have to make 13,000 staff redundant, Mr Cruz said that the company didn't ""need to get to that number"". However, a large number of long-serving cabin crew have taken voluntary redundancy and many staff felt that the terms being offered at the time meant that was their only choice. Mr Cruz told MPs that the pandemic had ""devastated our business... and we're still fighting for our own survival"". Last week the airline flew about 187,000 passengers  - about 25%-30% of its normal flight schedule. ""Everyone is facing decisions we never wanted to face,"" Mr Cruz said. He said he had taken a 33% pay cut during the pandemic, reducing his salary from the Â£805,000 he earned in 2019. But he refused to comment on an Â£833,000 bonus paid to the outgoing boss of BA's parent company, Willie Walsh. IAG faced a backlash from shareholders over that payment to Mr Walsh who left the company last week.

"England's education secretary has defended the Covid-19 testing system for schools, saying they can now order tests from the NHS directly. Gavin Williamson said schools were being prioritised, amid claims by head teachers of problems accessing tests. He stressed pupils sent home due to a Covid-19 case at their school should only seek tests if they have symptoms. Head teachers have written to the prime minister about their fears of further delays as virus cases rise. In their letter, teaching unions also called for easier access to public health advice to deal with Coronavirus cases in schools. 'Sense of foreboding' The heads of the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers warned Boris Johnson of ""a deep sense of foreboding"" about further delays in the system and called on the government to step up. Some schools in England had close their doors just after reopening, while others have told whole year groups or classes, which form ""bubbles"", to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Booking a test 'like getting Harry Potter tickets' Heads warn of staff shortages without Covid tests School figures show 88% back for start of term Teachers are isolating but still teach - by video Mr Williamson told the education select committee direct access to the test-kit ordering system for schools came into effect on Wednesday morning, two weeks after the start of this term. He told MPs: ""We have always been conscious that, with children coming back into school, there was going to be a situation where people would need more access to testing. ""This was why we have ensured these deliveries of testing kits,"" he said, and why ""just this morning we have opened up the ordering system for schools"". ""The support that we are putting towards education -  this is something quite unique - that schools can be able to pull that supply directly from the NHS."" Some teachers are teaching from home via video link He had met Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, to emphasize the importance and priority of schools and ensure testing is always available to them, he said. He said only people with coronavirus symptoms should be tested, not the whole ""cohort"" who are sent home. Robert Halfon, committee chairman, asked Mr Williamson if he could ""guarantee"" pupils and teachers who needed Covid-19 tests would be able to get them locally within 48 hours in the event of an outbreak. Mr Williamson did not respond to that question but said schools were in a unique position to be able to have testing kits on site. Each school and college was given 10 home-testing kits at the start of term and schools can order more kits online from today, the minister added. A spokesman for the Northern Power House - an organisation seeking to boost industry and education in north of England - said problems were particularly difficult in parts of the north west with higher virus rates. And these areas have have high levels of economic deprivation, she said. ""Poorer pupils already lag behind their classmates and they are falling further and further behind when schools close, as they are less likely to have access to at-home support or technology. ""These children have been effectively hit by a triple-whammy of long-term disadvantage, school closures and now testing chaos. ""With challenges getting testing already wreaking havoc on our education system, it is also the lack of consistency in direction from the Department for Education and public health authorities which is frustrating school leaders when faced with decisions on whether to send home whole 'bubbles' or not. ""Without urgent steps from the government to address these issues, it will be the most vulnerable children who will pay the highest price."" General secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, Dr Patrick Roach, suggested the system was not working. He said: ""Areas where additional local restrictions have been introduced, due to the increase in the R (reproduction) number, are now unable to cope with demand for tests. ""Teachers, support staff and children and young people are unable to access tests where they have Covid-19 symptoms. Employers are struggling to deal with the implications and consequences."" Local authorities across the country - including in the North West of England - are struggling to cope with demand, he added. He highlighted the situation in Bury, where hundreds of pupils are self-isolating, and Salford, where the council has been inundated with requests for tests from schools. Dr Roach said: ""Schools appear to be seeking to do their utmost to carry on. ""However, we have reports that schools are unable to cope with a situation that is becoming increasingly out of control.""

"Carbon dioxide emissions from plug-in hybrid cars are as much as two-and-a-half times higher than official tests suggest, according to new research. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are powered by an electric motor using a battery that is recharged by being plugged in or via an on-board petrol or diesel engine. They account for 3% of new car sales. But analysis from pressure groups Transport and Environment and Greenpeace suggest they emit an average of 120g of CO2 per km. That compares with the 44g per km in official ""lab"" tests Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are sold as a low-carbon alternative to traditional vehicles and conventional hybrids - which cannot be recharged from an external source - and are proving increasingly popular. The new research,externalis published as the government considers whether to bring forward a proposed ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and conventional hybrid cars from 2035 to 2030. The BBC understands one suggestion is that plug-in hybrids should be given a stay of execution, with new sales allowed to continue until 2035. That's because they can offer a 20- to 40-mile range as a purely electric vehicle and are therefore potentially significantly less polluting than other vehicles. But this new analysis from Transport and Environment and Greenpeace suggests they don't offer anything like the carbon dioxide savings claimed for them by manufacturers. The official tests indicate that plug-in hybrids emit an average of 44g per km of CO2. These tests are conducted on a circuit and see vehicles driven in a way that regulators consider ""normal"". The real figure, however, according to the report, is more like 120g per km. A really simple guide to climate change The five major challenges facing electric vehicles How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? The pressure groups have analysed what they say is ""real-world"" data on fuel efficiency collected from some 20,000 plug-in hybrid drivers around Europe. These are drivers who have chosen to record their mileage and fuel consumption for surveys or who drive company or leased vehicles whose fuel efficiency is recorded. According to this data-set the lifetime emissions of a plug-in hybrid average around 28 tonnes of CO2. By comparison, the average petrol or diesel car is estimated to emit between 39 and 41 tonnes of CO2 from fuel during its lifetime, a conventional hybrid would typically emit more like 33 tonnes. According to these figures a plug-in hybrid would only deliver an emissions reduction of about a third on a typical petrol or diesel car - far less than the official estimates. The motor industry acknowledges that lab tests don't always reflect real-world use but criticised the report, saying it uses emissions data from a test that is two years old. ""PHEVs provide a flexibility few other technologies can yet match with extended range for longer, out-of-town journeys and battery power in urban areas, reducing emissions and improving city air quality,"" Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told the BBC. He says he expects the range and performance will continue to improve, making them an ""essential stepping stone to a fully electric vehicle"". Greenpeace meanwhile describes PHEVs as ""the car industry's wolf in sheep's clothing"". ""They may seem a much more environmentally friendly choice,"" says Rebecca Newsom, the pressure group's head of politics, ""but false claims of lower emissions are a ploy by car manufacturers to go on producing SUVs and petrol and diesel engines."" Transport and Environment's analysis says a key problem with plug-in hybrids is that so many owners rarely actually charge their cars, meaning they rely on the petrol or diesel engine. Another is that many plug-in hybrid models include design features that automatically turn on the petrol/diesel engine at start-up on a cold day, or will kick in that engine if driver accelerates hard. The latter mode means that the car's emissions will depend a lot on the driver's behaviour. ""If you always charge the battery and tend to do lots of short journeys, they will have very low emissions,"" says Nick Molden, who runs Emissions Analytics, a company that specialises in vehicle emissions evaluation. ""If you never charge the battery and drive very aggressively then they can have significantly higher emissions than the equivalent petrol or diesel model,"" he continues.

"The U-turn in this summer's exams in England became unavoidable, as numbers challenging grades would have overwhelmed the appeals system, said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Facing questions from MPs over the exams fiasco, he defended the principle of using calculated grades, but said too many ""inconsistencies"" emerged. Mr Williamson also denied making the exams watchdog take down its guidance. He also told MPs schools would be able to order more Covid-19 testing kits. With head teachers warning that schools might have to send home pupils because of delays with testing, Mr Williamson said he had met Baroness Harding, head of the test and trace system, to emphasise that testing for schools had to be a ""priority"". Multiple warnings ahead of big U-turn over the summer exams Ofqual warned ministers replacement results would not be accepted Sally Collier steps down after exam chaos Schools can now order replacement testing kits, he said, after they were sent an initial batch of 10 per school. But he would not commit to a ""48-hour guarantee"" for turning around test results, as suggested by Education Select Committee chairman Robert Halfon. The education secretary was giving evidence to MPs about the chaos surrounding this summer's A-level, GCSE and vocational exams. Mr Williamson said that when the decision to cancel exams was taken in March, there was a need for ""certainty"" - and it was not feasible to plan for conventional exams, which might later have to be scrapped. He stood by the decision to use calculated grades instead - saying they were fairer for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds - but said the problems and errors emerged when results were issued. Gavin Williamson told MPs that he did not give instructions to Ofqual to remove appeals guidance ""The reality was there were too many inconsistencies in terms of the grades. That was one of the real challenges - and that lead to a lack of public confidence in the awarded grades,"" he told MPs. There had been confusion over a decision to allow appeals to be made over mock test results - with the exam regulator Ofqual publishing rules for how this would work and then taking them down the same day. Mr Williamson denied that he had ordered this - saying that he had wanted changes, but it had not been his decision to remove the guidance. The volume of appeals that would have been expected from allowing the use of mock test results was such that the appeals system would not have been able to cope, he told MPs. ""What became increasingly clear,"" he said, ""was that an appeals system now, no matter how robust, no matter how wide, how open was not going to be sufficient to address the number of youngsters applying"". And in response, in a major U-turn, results were then switched to the ""centre assessment grades"" submitted by schools, with mock tests being ditched for appeals. Head teachers' union leader Geoff Barton was unimpressed. ""Pupils, teachers, parents and taxpayers deserve better answers than this,"" he said. The responses to the committee did not really explain ""what went wrong with the grading process this summer"", said Mr Barton. There were protests calling for a U-turn after the original grades were issued David Blunkett, a former Labour education secretary, said later that in the end the ""buck stops with the education secretary"". Questioned on blurred lines of responsibility and accountability between ministers and Ofqual, the education secretary emphasised that Ofqual was not subject to his oversight. ""Ofqual is most clearly very independent,"" he said. He also refused to be drawn into questions over whether Ofqual ""got it wrong"" in their approach to awarding exams, instead offering praise for Sally Collier, the chief regulator, who resigned following the exams crisis. In terms of recognising early warnings that there could be problems with the algorithm system - Mr Williamson said the Department for Education did not get any detailed view of results until the week they were published. But he also suggested he would not be able to share with MPs a briefing about the exams given to officials at 10 Downing Street a week before results were published. Asked whether Ofqual's reputation had been badly damaged, he said: ""What we both failed to recognise was the fact that we weren't in peace time. ""But we were in a very different situation in terms of the global pandemic."" And the education secretary refused to be drawn into questions about whether his most senior civil servant had resigned due to providing unsatisfactory advice. Asked about next year's exams, Mr Williamson said it was ""vital and so important that we get the exams series up and running for 2021"". ""I have repeatedly told Parliament that we are going ahead with exams next year,"" he said. His department was planning for a potentially different approach that could see ""extra capacity within schools and a wider use of public buildings for exam sectors"", he added.

"Plans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days, the justice secretary has said. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Robert Buckland said. Resolving delays with testing was ""the number one issue"", he added. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said each school was given 10 home-testing kits at the start of term and could now order more from today. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the prime minister had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing but ""then breaks those promises"". Standing in for party leader Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs, she told the House of Commons: ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises. ""The health secretary said yesterday it would take weeks to sort this situation out. We don't have weeks."" Mr Johnson defended the government's record, saying the UK had ""done more tests than any other European country"". He said it was trying to meet a ""colossal spike"" in demand at ""record speed"", adding that 89% of tests done in person were being returned the next day. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Speaking earlier to BBC Breakfast, Mr Buckland said testing centres would be increasing from about 400 to 500 in the next few weeks. As well as prioritising tests for the NHS and then social care, he said schools were also important because of their ""knock-on effect to the working lives of parents and carers"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will announce who will be prioritised for tests in the next few days. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings and beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Test slots are limited because, while there seem to be enough testing sites, there are bottlenecks in labs for processing swabs, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. A new lab is due to be up and running but that could be a few weeks away - and until thenministers say current problems are likely to continue. Bolton NHS Trust in Greater Manchester said thatmore than 100 people had turned up to accident and emergencyon Tuesday asking for a test. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're working around the clock to make sure everyone who needs a test can get a test"" Mr Hancock, speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, said rising demand for tests meant the government was ""having to prioritise once again and I do not shirk from decisions about prioritisation"". Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but Mr Hancock said it was ""less than a day's capacity"". That means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. The Department of Health has said about a quarter of people requesting tests have no need to do so - and only those with relevant symptoms should book. Some closed for a period days after reopening while others have told classes and whole year groups - many of which form one bubble  - to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Teaching unions have called for the education sector to be prioritised for the allocation of tests to ensure schools remain open. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said if issues with testing capacity were not fixed keeping schools open would become ""unsustainable"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme head teachers would have to decide whether a bubble stays at home if a pupil or teacher showed Covid-19 symptoms and could not get a test to prove they were negative. It would feel like lockdown ""by default"", he said, and be more frustrating for parents as it is unpredictable. The ASCL, along with two other unions representing head teachers and governors - NAHT and the National Governance Association - has written to the PM expressing concern over the delays, saying school leaders are in an ""impossible situation"". Nearly 300 pupils sent home after positive test School figures show 88% back for start of term Can my child go to school with a cold? Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on Wednesday he had emphasised the importance of prioritising schools to Baroness Harding, head of the UK testing system. He said they had this morning opened a schools ordering system to access tests directly from the NHS. Cafe owners Scott Vining and his wife worry testing delays mean they will have to close their family business Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" 'How am I supposed to get my family of eight tested?' At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family of four, the spaces had disappeared. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people trying to get tests at a centre in Oldham Maria Aziz, from west London, has been trying to book a test since Sunday, when her nine-year-old daughter, Mishal, complained of a sore throat. By 04:00 Monday, her daughter had developed a fever. She said she had spent three days trying and failing to book a test. Her eldest daughter, Eimann, 14, also had to be withdrawn from school while she tried to book a test for her younger daughter. ""I'm trying through the government website and then yesterday there was also a number on the website to call - 119 - so I tried that as well. Each time there were no tests available. No home kits.

"People queue for tests in Southampton Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended the coronavirus testing system, saying it is trying to meet a ""colossal spike"" in demand. It comes as the government said it wasdrawing up a list setting out who will be prioritised for tests. Care home residents and staff are likely to be near the top of the list, as Mr Johnson acknowledged ministers were concerned about infection rates. The PM told MPs a new ""action plan"" for care homes will be released this week. Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said schools could be considered for priority testing. On Wednesday, coronavirus cases in the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219,according to figures from the government.,external A further 20 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This brings the UK death total by this criteria to 41,684. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Not enough tests for five months, study predicts Mr Johnson said 89% of those who have in-person tests get them the next day. He told Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday: ""I think most people looking at the record of this country in delivering tests across this nation will see that it actually compares extremely well with any other European country."" The PM had promised that all in-person test results would be back within 24 hours by the end of June. He acknowledged the frustration around the demand for tests, but said capacity was being increased, with the government wanting 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. Mr Johnson admitted ""we are concerned about the rates of infection in care homes"" and promised a new action plan for the sector would be released this week. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs as Sir Keir was self-isolating due to a family member showing symptoms and awaiting the results of a test, which has since been returned as negative. She told MPs Mr Johnson needed to ""get some skates on"" to address the issues. ""Those care workers are still not getting the PPE they need, they're still not getting the testing they need,"" she said. This video can not be played Angela Rayner accuses the PM of blaming others for his âincompetence"" with ""no plan"" for a second coronavirus wave Ms Rayner also said the prime minister had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing, but ""then breaks those promises"". ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises,"" she said. ""The health secretary said yesterday it would take weeks to sort this situation out. We don't have weeks."" Earlier, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Breakfast thatplans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Robert Buckland said. He also said testing centres would be increasing from about 400 to 500 in the next few weeks. Elsewhere,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said each school could, from today, order more testing kits, having each been given 10 at the start of term. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings and beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Test slots are limited because, while there seem to be enough testing sites, there are bottlenecks in labs for processing swabs, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. A new lab is due to be up and running but that could be a few weeks away - and until thenministers say current problems are likely to continue. Bolton NHS Trust in Greater Manchester said thatmore than 100 people had turned up to accident and emergencyon Tuesday asking for a test. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're working around the clock to make sure everyone who needs a test can get a test"" Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons on Tuesday it was ""less than a day's capacity"". That means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. The Department of Health has said about a quarter of people requesting tests have no need to do so - and only those with relevant symptoms should book. Some closed for a period days after reopening while others have told classes and whole year groups - many of which form one bubble  - to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Teaching unions have called for the education sector to be prioritised for the allocation of tests to ensure schools remain open. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said if issues with testing capacity were not fixed keeping schools open would become ""unsustainable"". Nearly 300 pupils sent home after positive test School figures show 88% back for start of term Can my child go to school with a cold? Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on Wednesday he had emphasised the importance of prioritising schools to Baroness Harding, head of the UK testing system. Cafe owners Scott Vining and his wife worry testing delays mean they will have to close their family business Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" 'How am I supposed to get my family of eight tested?' At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website.

"There is no need for British Airways to lay off cabin crew and then rehire them on inferior terms, boss Alex Cruz has said. Unions and MPs had accused the airline of following a ""fire and rehire"" policy, which saw some employees facing pay cuts of up to 50%. But Mr Cruz told MPs ""there will be no need to issue new contracts"", subject to staff approval. BA reached the outline of a jobs agreement with union Unite last week. The pair have been in a bitter dispute over BA's plans to shed up to 13,000 jobs and cut pay, amid a collapse in demand for air travel. Speaking to the Transport Select Committee, Mr Cruz said it was a matter of ""regret"" that it took 73 days for BA's non-pilot unions to sit down and negotiate. But Labour MP Sam Tarry responded: ""I would argue that if you hadn't put a metaphorical gun to their head then that might not have happened."" This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Mr Cruz said the airline would now follow the ""standard methodology"" of union agreements and make amendments to existing contracts. Details are still being worked out and ballots of some staff are yet to be held. Long-serving cabin crew members face a 15% pay reduction, while hoping to retain many of the allowances which constitute a significant part of their overall pay. ""We have reached agreements in a majority of areas,"" Mr Cruz said. ""We very much hope that the result of the ballots will be to accept those ballots."" In relation to whether or not BA will have to make 13,000 staff redundant, Mr Cruz said that the company didn't ""need to get to that number"". However, a large number of long-serving cabin crew have taken voluntary redundancy and many staff felt that the terms being offered at the time meant that was their only choice. Mr Cruz told MPs that the pandemic had ""devastated our business... and we're still fighting for our own survival"". Last week the airline flew about 187,000 passengers  - about 25%-30% of its normal flight schedule. ""Everyone is facing decisions we never wanted to face,"" Mr Cruz said. He said he had taken a 33% pay cut during the pandemic, reducing his salary from the Â£805,000 he earned in 2019. But he refused to comment on an Â£833,000 bonus paid to the outgoing boss of BA's parent company, Willie Walsh. IAG faced a backlash from shareholders over that payment to Mr Walsh who left the company last week.

"The UK government's law officer for Scotland, Lord Keen, has resigned amid a legal row over Brexit legislation. The advocate general said he had ""found it increasingly difficult to reconcile"" his obligations as a lawyer with provisions in the Internal Market Bill. Ministers have admitted that their plans could ""break international law"". Lord Keen's resignation was initially not accepted by Downing Street, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying that conversations were ongoing. However it was later confirmed that he had left his post. The government's most senior lawyer - Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the government legal department -had already resigned over the bill, which passed its first parliamentary test on Monday. PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis hastold MPs the legislation could break international lawby overriding the withdrawal agreement signed with the EU. Lord Keen initially tried to defend the legislation, arguing that Mr Lewis had ""essentially answered the wrong question"". He told the House of Lords that his view was that ""the bill does not of itself constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law"". But the Northern Ireland secretary later doubled down, saying that his statement was a ""very straight answer"" which was ""absolutely in line"" with legal advice. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says he gave the âcorrectâ answer when he was asked if the Internal Market Bill would break international law. In his resignation letter, Lord Keen said it had been a ""privilege"" to serve as advocate general for Scotland, but said that the government ""faces challenges on a number of fronts and I fear that the internal market bill in its present form will not make these any easier"". He added: ""Over the past week I have found it increasingly difficult to reconcile what I consider to be my obligations as a law officer with your policy intentions with respect to the Internal Markets Bill. ""I have endeavoured to identify a respectable argument for the provisions at clauses 42 to 45 of the bill, but it is now clear that this will not meet your policy intentions. ""In these circumstances I consider that it is my duty to tender my resignation from your government."" Mr Johnson had said discussions about Lord Keen's future were ""continuing"" on Wednesday afternoon when he appeared before the Commons Liaison Committee. But shortly after the committee concluded, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed that the advocate general had left his post and thanked him for his service. The BBC understands Mr Johnsonhas already struck a deal with potential Tory rebelsover the legislation, which would give MPs ""an extra layer of parliamentary oversight"". Richard Keen had been the chairman of the Scottish Conservatives until being appointed as Advocate General in 2015 - when he was also made a life peer as Baron Keen of Elie. The QC has represented the UK government in court in a number of high-profile cases, including over the prorogation of parliament in 2019 and the ""Article 50"" Brexit case in 2016-17. As a law officer in the UK government, Lord Keen had been defending plans to give ministers powers to change the EU withdrawal agreement in the event that the two sides can't agree a trade deal. He argued that while this part of the UK internal market bill creates tension with the UK's international obligations, that is not unprecedented and that domestic law should prevail. The trouble is, the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has already said that overriding the Brexit divorce deal would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" and he's rejected Lord Keen's suggestion that he'd answered incorrectly. That made it increasingly difficult for Lord Keen to reconcile the government's plans with the law and he wrote to the prime minister on Wednesday morning offering his resignation. Lord Keen is the first member of the government to quit over its approach to this issue, which has drawn criticism from former attorneys general and all five living former prime ministers. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But some senior Conservatives - including former Prime Minister John Major - have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. The legislation has alsoproved controversial with the devolved administrations, which are concerned about how the UK's ""internal market"" will operate post-Brexit and who will set regulations and standards. This video can not be played Leyen: UK and EU ""jointly agreed"" on withdrawal agreement Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen has warned the UK cannot unilaterally set aside the withdrawal agreement. She said on Wednesday the agreement was the only way to guarantee the Northern Ireland peace process, and warned that its replacement would undermine trust in the UK. PM defends planned Brexit deal changes What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Last week marked the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto generic World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached.

"Travel company Tui has promised to clear a backlog of refunds by the end of the month following an investigation by the UK's competition authority. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had received thousands of complaints from customers waiting many weeks for their money back. Refunds for cancelled package holidays should be completed within 14 days. Holidays plans were ruined by the coronavirus outbreak, and delays over refunds added to frustrations. Following the CMA investigation, Tui said it would clear outstanding refunds by 30 September. The promise covers all of Tui UK's different businesses that offer package holidays, including First Choice, First Choice Holidays, Marella Cruises, Crystal Ski, Crystal, Tui Scene, Tui Lakes and Mountains, and Skytours. Roy Parry, of Wigan, had booked a Â£2,500 Tui holiday to Barbados to celebrate the end of his chemotherapy treatment in April. After the holiday was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, he said he spent hours on the phone to Tui, trying to claim a refund. Eventually he was credited by his credit card provider. Tui later contacted him to offer a refund which he declined, but then the credit card company asked for the money back. ""It was a lot of hassle,"" Mr Parry said. ""If Tui had done what they should have done and refunded people at the time, people wouldn't have been in that situation. ""There's enough difficulty in the world as it is. Tui added to that. They said it was a Covid issue. I don't buy that. I work in telecoms, we were getting things sorted within days. ""I don't think you should use the Covid for an excuse for not behaving the way your customers expect a seriously large company like them to behave."" Customers who received Refund Credit Notes will also be contacted to be told they are entitled to cash refund instead, which would be provided within 14 days. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, said: ""It is absolutely essential that people have trust and confidence when booking package holidays and know that if a cancellation is necessary as a result of coronavirus, businesses will give them a full, prompt refund. ""The CMA is continuing to investigate package holiday firms in the context of the Covid-19 crisis. If we find that businesses are not complying with consumer protection law, we will not hesitate to take further action."" Package holiday firms told to sharpen up on refunds Tui: Holiday bookings for next summer jump 145% It has been a tough period for the sector and for Tui. In late July, the company said it would shut 166 High Street stores in the UK and Ireland. Bookings plunged 81% for the summer and were 40% lower for a scaled-back winter programme. However, bookings are more positive for next year as holidaymakers pland ahead in the hope of an easing of pandemic restrictions. If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance is unlikely to cover you Tui sees surge in holiday bookings for next year 'Covidiots' criticised on Tui quarantine flight Holiday firms told to sharpen up on refunds Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething announces a local lockdown for Rhondda Cynon Taf from 18:00 BST on Thursday to tackle a ""rapid"" rise in cases This will include a 23:00 BST curfew for pubs, bars and restaurants - going further than the lockdown in Caerphilly Earlier, Mr Gething said up to five extra mobile testing units would be deployed to Covid-19 hotspots in Wales this week People seeking tests have spoken of their frustration over the time it takes to book, distance to travel, and long waits on arrival Mr Gething has blamed the delays on problems with the UK government's Lighthouse Labs Another 199 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, although there are no further deaths, Public Health Wales said on Wednesday Rachel Flint, Nicola Bryan and Andy Roberts Thanks for following our live coverage of the Welsh Government's press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. Today, another 240,000 people will be preparing for restrictions to their daily lives, asa local lockdown begins in Rhondda Cynon Tafat 18:00 BST on Thursday. The measures mean no one will be allowed to enter or leave the area without reasonable excuse, while pubs and bars will have to close at 23:00 BST every night from tomorrow. The restrictions will be reviewed in two weeks' time. What we also learned today:  We'll keep you updated on the coronavirus situation in Wales via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. No-one has died with coronavirus in Wales since the end of August, Public Health Wales figures show. Two people were confirmed to have died on 31 August, but no deaths have been reported since. However the deaths only include people who died in hospitals and care homes, who tested positive for coronavirus and whose results were confirmed in a lab. A lack of social-distancing is causing an increase in coronavirus in a number of communities, Public Health Wales has said. On Wednesday, it confirmed there were 199 new cases but no new deaths. Incident director Dr Robin Howe said the new local lockdown across Rhondda Cynon Taf from 18:00 BST Thursday was ""essential to protect people's health and control the spread of coronavirus"". But Dr Howe said there was now ""a steady increase in cases in a number of communities across Wales"". ""Our investigations show that many of these have been transmitted due to a lack of social distancing,"" he said. âCoronavirus has not gone away.  It remains the responsibility of everyone to help prevent the spread of this virus to protect older and vulnerable family members and friends."" The number of people who have died with coronavirus in Wales remains at 1,597. No new deaths were reported by Public Health Wales on Wednesday for the 15th day running. However, 199 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed. Local Democracy Reporting Service Pontypridd councillor Heledd Fychan has expressed her disappointment at the local lockdown announced for Rhondda Cynon Taf. New restrictions will take effect in this part of the south Wales valleysfrom 18:00 BST on Thursday. Ms Fychan, a town and county councillor, said: âIâm hugely disappointed but not surprised to see the local lockdown being announced. âMore could have been done to try and prevent this countywide lockdown, including introducing hyper-local lockdowns around clusters and making face coverings mandatory sooner. âBut we are where we are. We must now must work together to adhere to the measures, and stop the further spread of the virus.â Heledd Fychan says hyper-local lockdowns and mandatory face masks could have prevented the need for countywide restrictions Another 199 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Wales, taking the total to 19,880. On Wednesday, no new deaths were reported, with the figure remaining at 1,597. Public Health Wales figures show that 52 new cases were confirmed in Rhondda Cynon Taf, where the Welsh governmenthas announced a local lockdownwill begin tomorrow night. In Caerphilly county borough, where restrictions are already in place, 36 new cases were confirmed. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Local lockdown for Rhondda Cynon Taff Health Minister Vaughan Gething says people should not enter or leave Rhondda Cynon Taf from tomorrow evening without good reason. Issues with processing test results across the UK must be resolved to help avoid wider local lockdowns, Wales' health minister has said. People have reported having to travel long distances to get access to tests after demand caused issues with the testing system run under the Lighthouse labs partnership. Vaughan Gething said the delays were ""unhelpful"" as contact tracing had been doing well, with 98% of new cases being successfully traced. ""The sooner the Lighthouse lab issue is resolved, the sooner we have that capacity and the faster turnaround that we're used to seeing, up until about three weeks ago,"" he said. Mr Gething added that once testing issues were resolved ministers and health officials would be in a better position to understand clusters and take ""smart lockdown measures"" and have the ability to ""avoid the much wider local lockdowns we're having to introduce today"". Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) is joining Caerphilly county borough under a local lockdown. Rules are to be tightened from 18:00 BST on Thursday in RCT where coronavirus cases have continued to rise. For the estimated 421,000 people in those two council areas who will be living under lockdown, it means a number of things have changed for the foreseeable future. Read our guideto what you can and can't do. There will bean extra 5,000 NHS beds- half in field hospitals - to cope with winter pressures, including a potential second wave of Covid-19 in hospitals. Unveiling the winter plan for NHS Wales, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was ""expected to be our most difficult yet"". The extra capacity is to deal with a worst-case scenario. Meanwhile, the flu vaccine will be available to both people shielding and their families. NHS Wales said without action taken in March, there could have been 100,000 hospital admissions as well as ""very significant numbers of deaths"". Chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said: ""If there's a second peak, we have to have the NHS capacity in place."" A field hospital at Cardiff's Principality Stadium is to be replaced by a new unit at the city's main hospital While Caerphilly county borough was the first part of Wales to be placed into lockdown, the restrictions in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) are more severe. From tomorrow night, pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants with alcohol licences will have to close at 23:00 BST. But this has not been the case in Caerphilly county borough. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Vaughan Gething said pubs were ""a factor in transmission in RCT in a way that we didn't have evidence for within Caerphilly"". Asked why he was not closing all the pubs in Rhondda Cynon Taf, rather than just stopping late-night opening, the minister said it was not about ""just the economic impact of people losing businesses and jobs"". ""There will be people who carry on drinking, and if there are no opportunities to drink in licensed premises we may see more people breaking the rules and drinking in each other's homes,"" Mr Gething said. ""And that's a much more significant challenge for us in the spread of coronavirus."" Wales' health minister has revealed he decided not to include his mother in his own extended household due to the risk of coronavirus. An extended household, or so called bubble, allows people to meet family and friends indoors, hug and touch, and stay overnight. But Vaughan Gething said he had not included his own mother in his extended household, due to the ""bigger risk"" he posed. ""I am more likely to be in contact with more people than my mother who is older and a different risk. So my mother isn't part of my extended household, so I don't go into her house,"" he said. ""I take shopping and leave it outside in a conservatory. I don't go indoors, because I recognise I represent a bigger risk."" The MP for Pontypridd has posted a video to urge people in Rhondda Cynon Taf to take care and stay safe as the area faces a local lockdown from Thursday evening. Alex Davies-Jones says she will make more information available when she has it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Teachers and school staff are picking up coronavirus from ""interacting with each other, or other adults outside school"" rather than pupils, Wales' health minister has said. A number of schools across Wales have had to send pupils home since the new term started last week after cases were confirmed. But Vaughan Gething said it was very clear from evidence in Wales and Scotland that pupils were not transmitting the virus to teachers. ""It isn't the case that those staff are put into a uniquely difficult place where they're likely to get Covid from their students,"" he said. ""It's actually adult-to-adult contact that is still the biggest factor, and the biggest concern."" Mr Gething said he expected there to be ""further school classrooms that may need to isolate as people test positive, as we go through the autumn, and the winter"". He said there were ""still very high attendance rates within our schools, and lots of students are back in school receiving education and enjoying it, just as my son is."" Coronavirus is ""difficult"" for people heading off to university, the health minister has said. Many students across Wales will be moving away from home for the first time, as university courses start in the next few weeks. Vaughan Gething said he understood it was ""really difficult"" for students to not have contact with people as they started their new lives. ""It's about thinking about the nature of the contact you have, in particular indoor contact,"" he said, adding that people should try to see a ""reduced number of people"". Rhondda's member of the Senedd (MS) Leanne Wood has shared a video to tell people in her area about the local lockdown taking effect  from Thursday evening. She said not being able to leave the area without a ""reasonable excuse"" would prompt a lot of discussion over what was considered to be reasonable. Allow Twitter content?

From Thursday evening the way tens of thousands of people live in Wales will change. At 18:00 BST Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) will be placed under local lockdown, following an increase in cases. Bars and pubs will have to close at 23:00 BST, while no-one will be  able to travel in or out of the area without reasonable excuse, including for work. The changes affect the estimated 240,131 people who live in the area, including major towns such as Aberdare, Llantrisant, Pontypridd and Tonypandy. This area of the south Wales valleys with a history of mining and heavy industry now includes 17.5% of Walesâ most deprived
communities. Earlier this year hundreds of homes and
businesses were damaged when the region was battered repeatedly by floods during storms Dennis and Ciara. Billions of coins are made at the
Royal Mint at Llantrisant, a major local employer with 900 staff. The area is popular with swimmers heading for the lido in Pontypridd, which was damaged by flood waters
in the storms. The lockdown measures in Rhondda Cynon Taf will be reviewed in two weeks, Wales' health minister has said. From 18:00 BST on Thursday, no-one will be able to enter or leave the council boundaries without reasonable excuse, and pubs will have to close at 23:00 BST. Vaughan Gething said the measures would be reviewed after two weeks, but that it would take two or three weeks to see if they have had an impact. He said there were ""cautious reasons"" for optimism, based on how lockdown measures were working in Caerphilly county borough. The minister said there had been a ""levelling off and a slight reduction in new cases there"". Cardiff South and Penarth Labour MP Stephen Doughty has tackled Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions over problems with people getting tests. He says: ""It is clear the problems originate, not in Wales, but with the UK testing and online system which has led to rationing, chaos and confusion, and all the while the virus spreads further."" ""This should have been seen coming months ago,"" he added. ""The prime minister is incompetent and he hasn't got control of this. When is he going to get a grip?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""Once again the opposition is at risk of undermining the colossal work of NHS test and trace."" He says the government are ""continuing to improve the system the whole time"". Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething says pubs have been a ""real factor"" in the spread of coronavirus in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT). From Thursday, bars, pubs and restaurants with alcohol licences will have to close at 23:00 BST, ending late-night opening. The local lockdown restrictions in RCT are more severe than in Caerphilly county borough, which was the first part of Wales to be placed under extra measures. Mr Gething said: ""A bar has been closed in Pontypridd after a series of breaches were captured on CCTV; a licensed premise was closed in Tonypandy, and improvement notices for another bar in Pontypridd and a barber's in Tonypandy have also been issued."" He said a further 50 licensed premises were visited by council officers over the weekend and more enforcement action â either improvement notices or closure orders â are likely to follow.

"There is no need for British Airways to lay off cabin crew and then rehire them on inferior terms, boss Alex Cruz has said. Unions and MPs had accused the airline of following a ""fire and rehire"" policy, which saw some employees facing pay cuts of up to 50%. But Mr Cruz told MPs ""there will be no need to issue new contracts"", subject to staff approval. BA reached the outline of a jobs agreement with union Unite last week. The pair have been in a bitter dispute over BA's plans to shed up to 13,000 jobs and cut pay, amid a collapse in demand for air travel. Speaking to the Transport Select Committee, Mr Cruz said it was a matter of ""regret"" that it took 73 days for BA's non-pilot unions to sit down and negotiate. But Labour MP Sam Tarry responded: ""I would argue that if you hadn't put a metaphorical gun to their head then that might not have happened."" This video can not be played BA staff facing redundancy or pay cuts speak out Mr Cruz said the airline would now follow the ""standard methodology"" of union agreements and make amendments to existing contracts. Details are still being worked out and ballots of some staff are yet to be held. Long-serving cabin crew members face a 15% pay reduction, while hoping to retain many of the allowances which constitute a significant part of their overall pay. ""We have reached agreements in a majority of areas,"" Mr Cruz said. ""We very much hope that the result of the ballots will be to accept those ballots."" In relation to whether or not BA will have to make 13,000 staff redundant, Mr Cruz said that the company didn't ""need to get to that number"". However, a large number of long-serving cabin crew have taken voluntary redundancy and many staff felt that the terms being offered at the time meant that was their only choice. Mr Cruz told MPs that the pandemic had ""devastated our business... and we're still fighting for our own survival"". Last week the airline flew about 187,000 passengers  - about 25%-30% of its normal flight schedule. ""Everyone is facing decisions we never wanted to face,"" Mr Cruz said. He said he had taken a 33% pay cut during the pandemic, reducing his salary from the Â£805,000 he earned in 2019. But he refused to comment on an Â£833,000 bonus paid to the outgoing boss of BA's parent company, Willie Walsh. IAG faced a backlash from shareholders over that payment to Mr Walsh who left the company last week.

"The Unite union has called on the government to say it will extend its furlough scheme or face ""redundancy floodgates"" opening in the UK. Many workers can expect a ""miserable Christmas"" without targeted support for employers, the union warned. The government's furlough programme will end on 31 October. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had ""not hesitated to act in creative and effective ways to support jobs and we will continue to do so"". Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which is the same amount of time employers must give for notice of redundancy. The call comes amid growing evidence that the winding down of the scheme is leading to more plans for job cuts. Redundancy 'stressful and upsetting' Coronavirus: When will the furlough scheme end? Rishi Sunak: New ways to protect jobs 'my priority' The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June, 1,778 firms said they were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In total, nine million people have been furloughed for at least one three-week period since March, However, about 695,000 UK workers have gone from the payrolls of UK companies since then and it is feared that more will follow if the government stops paying to safeguard jobs. Unite said that without ""a clear and urgent sign"" from the government that it was responding to calls to extend the scheme, it feared that ""employers facing short-term struggles will issue redundancy notices"". The government has been urged by MPs, business groups, unions and political opponents to continue the furlough programme, in which workers placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. The scheme, which has cost more than Â£35bn, was initially funded by the government, but firms started to contribute to wages in September after the scheme began to wind down. Last week, the Treasury Select Committee said the governmentshould consider a targeted extension of the scheme. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said a signal from the government would ""put a floor under struggling employers who are working hard to stabilise in the face of immense challenges"". ""With our competitor nations announcing the extension or modification of their jobs retention schemes, we ask that your government recognises the need for UK businesses and workers to receive similar support,"" Mr McCluskey wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A spokeswoman said Unite wanted to see support for sectors including manufacturing, aviation infrastructure, aerospace and hospitality. The government has repeatedly rebuffed the calls for an extension to the scheme, saying that it has served its purpose in cushioning the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said hispriority is to find new ways to protect jobs. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The furlough scheme has done what it was designed to do - save jobs and help people back into employment."" The spokesperson said the government had made ""unprecedented interventions"", including firms being given Â£1,000 for every furloughed worker still employed in January, business rates holidays, VAT cuts and the Kickstart scheme, which gives young people jobs experience.

"Sexual and violent offenders will serve at least two-thirds of jail terms, rather than half, as part of changes to the criminal justice system in England and Wales. An overhaul of sentencing laws has been announced by the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. Whole-life orders will also be extended to 18 to 20-year-olds convicted of terrorism causing mass loss of life. Mr Buckland said it marked the end of ""complex and confusing"" laws. Covid court plan will not ease delays, lawyers say Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Minister warns over court case backlog from virus Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Buckland said the measures would ""keep offenders who pose a risk to the public off our streets for longer"". He said they would ""help restore public confidence that robust sentences are executed in a way that better reflects the gravity of the crimes committed"". Mr Buckland also said protecting the public meant ""finding new ways to break cycles of crime, to prevent a revolving door of short custodial sentences that we know offer little rehabilitative value"". More help is being promised for those with mental health issues, addictions and neurodiverse conditions such as autism. It comes after the criminal justice system ground to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic. There are steep backlogs and delays for victims and defendants, who are facing trial dates years ahead. Among the new interventions proposed in a White Paper published on Wednesday are: the option of a new whole life tariff for killers under the age of 21 whole life orders for adults who murder children - whichwas a pledge by the Conservatives at last year's general election. raising the sentencing threshold for serious offences including a ""third strike"" for burglaries and ""two strikes"" for knife possession new powers to halt the automatic release of offenders who pose a terrorist threat or are a danger to the public reducing the opportunities for over-18s who committed murder as a child to have their minimum jail term reviewed using GPS tags to track burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison deploying so-called ""sobriety tags"" to tackle alcohol-related crime And offenders sentenced to between four and seven years in prison for serious crimes such as rape and manslaughter will no longer be automatically considered for release halfway through their jail terms. However, one charity boss warned that ""increasing the prison population through longer sentences will only add more pressure to this already stretched system"". Campbell Robb, chief executive of social justice charity Nacro, said the UK needed a system that ""gives victims justice, reduces re-offending and creates a safer UK for everyone - senselessly banging people up for longer will not deliver this."" While tougher sentences are among the measures proposed, changes to criminal records to reduce the time offenders have to declare past crimes to employers are also included. A focus on supporting ex-offenders will see custodial sentences become ""spent"" after 12 months without reoffending, with convictions of up to four years no longer disclosed after a further four crime-free years. Sentences of more than four years will not automatically be disclosed to employers after a further seven-year period of rehabilitation is completed. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy welcomed the changes but sought assurance that new sentencing rules would not be applied ""gratuitously"". ""It would be wrong to abandon the general presumption in criminal law that when you're younger there is more opportunity for redemption and to turn your life around,"" he said. For the past few days, the government has been trailing its White Paper with a series of eye-catching announcements promising tougher sentences for terrorists, violent offenders and motorists who kill. Many of the plans are likely to command broad public support while measures to relax criminal records disclosure rules have the potential to make a real difference to ex-offenders struggling to find work. But the timing of the proposals is somewhat odd, as the government grapples with the biggest crisis the criminal justice system has faced in decades. Problems caused by the coronavirus have meant that a huge backlog of trials across England and Wales has got even bigger. The sentencing changes, if they go ahead, won't help the tens of thousands of victims, witnesses and defendants caught up in the backlog who now face the prospect of waiting up to two years for their day in court. The announcement of reforms to sentencing comes after lawyers warned hundreds of thousands of people may have to wait until 2022 for justice, due to delays in the Crown Courts. Since lockdown began in March, the backlog of Crown Court cases has risen by 6,000 to 43,000. The Ministry of Justice has pledged an extra 1,600 court staff and Â£80m towards a range of measures, including more Nightingale courts. And Mr Buckland has told the BBChe would ""use every tool in the book""to clear the case backlog. This video can not be played Robert Buckland: Government working on court backlog Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, he said the situation in Magistrates' Courts was ""encouraging - with the number of cases being dealt with exceeding the number coming into the system"". And he said the Crown Courts had been ""unique"" compared to other countries, as it ""kept going"" throughout the pandemic. But, he added: ""I am bearing down daily on my team in the Courts and Tribunals Service to make sure that they have got the resources they need to make the buildings safe and that judges and listing officers are doing everything they can to get those cases listed so we can achieve swift justice."" Meanwhile detection rates for crimes remain low, having fallen from one-in-seven crime reports leading to a charge in 2015to around one-in-14 last year.

"Prime Minister has said he ""does not believe"" the EU is negotiating a Brexit trade deal in good faith Boris Johnson admits the government does not have capacity to meet demand for coronavirus tests Prime Minister has been giving evidence to committee of senior MPs It was Boris Johnson's second appearance in front of the Liaison Committee this year The PM was asked about coronavirus, Brexit and foreign policy Earlier, Angela Rayner deputised for Keir Starmer at PMQs At PMQs, Boris Johnson defended the coronavirus testing system The PM said there has been a ""huge surge"" in demand in recent days Jennifer Scott and Paul Seddon It's been a busy day in Westminster... but it is time for us to bring this page to a close.

BBC Scotland earlier reported that Lord Keen - the government's chief lawyer for the nation - had offered his resignation to Boris Johnson. But, at the time, it was unclear whether it was going to be accepted by No 10. And even in the Liaison Committee, the PM said ""conversations were continuing"" over whether he would stay on or not. Peculiar language? Now, a statement has dropped from No 10 and it is now official he has quit. A Downing Street spokesman said: âLord Keen has resigned as Advocate

Select CommitteeParliament A couple of follow up questions which the prime minister agrees to stay and answer before the session comes to a close. The SNP's Angus MacNeil asks who will be responsible ifreports of long lorry queues in Kent come to fruition after Brexit. ""I don't think anybody has any illusions who is going to be held to account,"" says Johnson. ""It is certainly going to be me."" And finally, his Conservative colleague Greg Clark asks him what the PM is monitoring to ensure young people, who are making ""huge sacrifices"" will be allowed out of the ""rule of six"" measure sooner rather than later. Johnson says the ""single most important fact is what is the R doing, where is the R going"". R is the reproduction number, or R value, for Covid-19. Johnson continues, ""And alas, alas, alas, having been under one for so many months, after the fantastic efforts of the British people, it is now above one"". And that is it. The Liaison Committee has ended and back to No 10 the PM goes.  Select CommitteeParliament The next question comes from Conservative MP, Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence committee. He asks whether more use could be made of the Ministry of Defence in the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Johnson praises the ""outstanding"" officers he has met during the crisis, adding he was ""bowled over"" with the Army's efforts in distributing Covid tests. Mr Ellwood asks the PM to ""recognise the importance"" of conventional military equipment despite the need to invest more in areas such as cyber warfare. Mr Johnson says the UK is set for a ""fantastic time"" when it comes to shipbuilding. Select CommitteeParliament Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Select CommitteeParliament By video link, Labour's Sarah Champion asks whether the PM is looking to amend the International Development Act and what it constitutes as overseas aid within it. Johnson said he would ""reserve his position on amending the act"". But he adds: ""What we certainly want to do is ensure that ODA (overseas development assistance) is better spent on serving the interests... the diplomatic and the political values of the UK, and indeed the commercial and jobs interest of the UK."" Asked which regions may lose out as a result when such changes are made, the PM said it was ""like asking a lion to choose between its cubs"". He says he ""doesn't accept the idea"" that you need to remove parts of the world from the list to invest in others. Select CommitteeParliament Tom Tugendhat asks whether Japan should be allowed to join the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing pact between the UK and the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Johnson says this is not something Japan has raised with him, but it is an âidea weâre thinking about"". He adds it âmight be a productive wayâ to build on the UK's relationship with Japan. He cautions though that the group has its âparticular coherence,"" and the UK would have to work with its intelligence sharing partners over the proposal. Select CommitteeParliament For their last section, MPs are now questioning the PM about an ongoing review of the UK's foreign and security policies. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, asks whether the treatment of Uighur Muslims by the Chinese state in Xinjiang province ""amounts to genocide"". In reply, Mr Johnson says he finds their treatment ""objectionable,"" but genocide is an ""important term in international law"" and he doesn't believe the UK is so far in a position to use it regarding Xinjiang. He says he has raised the issue ""many times"" with ""our Chinese friends"". Reality Check Asked a few moments ago whether the EU was negotiating in good faith in talks on a future trade deal, the PM cited the fact that the bloc had so far refused to give the UK a  ""third country"" licence to export products of animal origin to the continent. Mr Johnson has raised the spectre in recent days of British food exports to mainland Europe and Northern Ireland, including lamb, beef and clotted cream, being effectively ""blockaded"". But how likely is this? The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morrishas been looking into the issue and the connection between this and the current political row over the Internal Markers Bill. He says a blockade seems ""highly unlikely"" since the EU Withdrawal Agreement contains safeguard measures which allow either side to act if the application of the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing ""serious economic difficulties that are liable to persist"". Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Astonishingly the Prime Minister couldn't answer whether one of his own law officers was still in post - the matter ofLord Keen's resignation,which he offered this morning, was still an 'ongoing' situation, the PM said. Around his preparation for this committee, Boris Johnson's been having various conversations about his Internal Market Bill, which has provoked anger among some Tory MPs and from the EU. Sir Bob Neill - who's leading efforts to amend it - was one of those questioning the PM this afternoon, but they didn't divulge the details of their private discussions. It looks like they might have reached a compromise behind the scenes that could head off a possible rebellion. But Boris Johnson doubled down on his controversial step of seeking to breach the Brexit divorce deal - saying, provocatively, that he believed the EU had been negotiating in bad faith. Select CommitteeParliament Meg Hillier comes back in to ask which of the PM's ministers is right - the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who said the bill only breaks international law if the power is used, or Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who said it breaks international law just by granting the power. Johnson will not be drawn on an answer. Instead, he replies: ""My position is the Attorney General's position and the objective of these measures is to protect this country against accidental or unreasonable measures that serve to break up the UK."" Select CommitteeParliament Next up is Conservative MP Sir Robert Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee. He asks the PM what ""practical steps"" negotiators are taking to ensure the UK continues to have access to judicial co-operation procedures with the EU, such as criminal databases, after its transition period. Mr Johnson says he won't ""go into detail"" on the negotiations but there is ""ample scope"" to continue co-operation with the 27-country bloc. Sir Bob asks for an update on efforts to get a so-called ""adequacy"" ruling from the EU, which would mean it deems UK data protection law reliable enough to share data cross-border. Mr Johnson says he hopes an agreement in this area can be found by the end of the transition, but does not mention a specific deadline. Select CommitteeParliament The SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil continues with the Brexit theme. He asks the PM how many Japan style trade deals the UK needs to ""make up the damage Brexit has given us"". Johnson again says he doesn't ""accept the characterisation"", and says post-Brexit, the UK will be ""at the heart of a great cats cradle of deals around the world"". MacNeil asks whether pushing his UK Internal Market Bill is a ""price worth paying"" aftercriticism from the likes of Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. In a tetchy exchange, the SNP MP warns it could mean losing out on a trade deal with those across the Atlantic. Johnson says he has the ""upmost respect"" for the US politicians criticising the law. But, he adds: ""I think when they understand and see what we are trying to do, they would share ambition and concern about protecting the balance and symmetry of the UK."" Select CommitteeParliament Sticking with Brexit, next up is Sir William Cash, who chairs the European Scrutiny Committee. He says the PM's plans tooverride sections of the withdrawal agreementin a bill is not unprecedented, saying he has around 20 examples of previous UK laws that have done this. He also says there are examples of the EU breaking international law itself, and accuses the bloc of ""double standards"" in its protests over the issue. In reply, the prime ministers says the bill is required to protect the UK internal market from the EU making ""extreme"" interpretations of the sections of the Brexit divorce deal relating to Northern Ireland. Select CommitteeParliament Benn - who chairs the Commons committee on the UK's future relationship with the EU - focuses his questioning on Internal Market Bill. He asks the PM why the existing withdrawal agreement does not do enough to allay his fears and he needs this bill. Johnson says the new legislation ""provides belt and braces protection"" and a ""water tight bulkhead"". He says he believes it is the ""only way... to provide the certainty and the protections that we are talking about"" when it comes to UK trade between its nations. Asked a number of times whether he believes the EU are negotiating in ""good faith"", the PM eventually replies: ""I don't believe they are. ""It is always possible I am mistaken, and perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong. ""But I prefer to have protections."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cheaper restaurant meals due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme saw prices rise at their slowest rate in five years. The UK's inflation rate,external, which tracks the prices of goods and services, fell to 0.2% in August, from 1% in July. Low inflation - the rate at which prices of everyday goods and services rise - is good for consumers and borrowers, but can be bad for savers. That is because while it makes things cheaper, it also affects the interest rates set by banks and other firms. The eating out scheme, which ran from Monday to Wednesday in August, offered 50% off food up to the value of Â£10. Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed through the scheme. Prices in restaurants and cafes were 2.6% lower than in August last year, the first time they had been negative since records began in 1989, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The cut to the rate of value added tax (VAT) also helped drive prices lower, it added. The discount, from 20% to 5%, lasts until 12 January next year, was introduced on food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. Restaurateur Paul Sharma Paul Sharma, owner of the newly established 2020 World Buffet restaurant in Peterborough, is extremely grateful to the government for the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. He first opened his doors to customers on 16 March, just before lockdown, but after a mere four days, he had to shut up shop. When he reopened, he had to reduce the restaurant's capacity of 450 to just 170 to follow social distancing measures, but he was fully booked and able to seat 1,000 people a day by opening right through the day. ""We had many, many thousands of customers,"" he told the BBC, adding that the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was ""massively helpful"". ""It's one of the best things the government has done for small businesses,"" he said. ""We could pay the salaries of our staff, we could pay all the outstanding bills that were pending since March. ""We're going to survive for the next few months and then hopefully, in the course of time, the virus will go away and then things will get normal."" The cost of clothing and footwear also fell significantly. And in an indication of the severe effect of the pandemic on travel and tourism, air fares dropped in price as fewer people travelled abroad because of quarantine restrictions. The ONS said this was unprecedented for August, which is usually the peak month of the holiday season. ""The cost of dining out fell significantly in August thanks to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and VAT cut, leading to one of the largest falls in the annual inflation rate in recent years,"" said ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow. ""For the first time since records began, air fares fell in August as fewer people travelled abroad on holiday. Meanwhile, the usual clothing price rises seen at this time of year, as autumn ranges hit the shops, also failed to materialise."" It was the lowest inflation rate since December 2015. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It affects everything from mortgages to the cost of our shopping and the price of train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. Read more here. A five-year low in the rise in consumer prices reflects the extraordinary action taken to try to get Brits back into town centres. The fall to 0.2% is overwhelmingly the result of the impact of Eat Out to Help Out and the temporary VAT cut for the hospitality sector. It is a statistic that reaffirms what we already know, but also reflects some freakishly temporary factors. The chancellor's restaurant subsidy scheme is already over, the VAT cuts expire in January. Inflation is likely to remain lower than its 2% target, except in the case of a further sharp fall in the value of the pound - for example, after a disorderly end to the post-Brexit trade talks. Either way, the Bank of England has more space for extra support to the economy in the coming months, without risking a surge in inflation. Probably not. Before the latest figures were published, there had been fears that the UK inflation rate might turn negative, giving rise to what is known as deflation. Economists fear deflation because falling prices lead to lower consumer spending, as shoppers put off big purchases in the expectation that they will get cheaper still. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said August's figure was probably ""the low point"" for inflation, but pointed out that it was unlikely to hit the Bank of England's 2% target within the next few years. ""The big picture is that it will be a few years before the economy is strong enough to sustain CPI inflation at the 2% target,"" he said. ""The big risk to this view is a no-deal Brexit, which could cause a slump in the pound and, in turn, a temporary sharp rise in inflation to above 3.5%."" Not necessarily. Although prices went up very little in August, a look at the figures over the past three months shows that on average, inflation has outstripped growth in pay. Inflation is calculated by looking at a ""basket"" of commonly purchased goods and comparing how much they cost now with last month and with the same time last year. During the pandemic, the ONS has been unable to identify prices for many of the 720 items it usually monitors. In August, the ONS said prices for only eight items were still unavailable, reflecting parts of the economy still unable to operate normally including cruises, live music, theatre, swimming pools and soft play sessions.

Select CommitteeParliament A couple of follow up questions which the prime minister agrees to stay and answer before the session comes to a close. The SNP's Angus MacNeil asks who will be responsible ifreports of long lorry queues in Kent come to fruition after Brexit. ""I don't think anybody has any illusions who is going to be held to account,"" says Johnson. ""It is certainly going to be me."" And finally, his Conservative colleague Greg Clark asks him what the PM is monitoring to ensure young people, who are making ""huge sacrifices"" will be allowed out of the ""rule of six"" measure sooner rather than later. Johnson says the ""single most important fact is what is the R doing, where is the R going"". R is the reproduction number, or R value, for Covid-19. Johnson continues, ""And alas, alas, alas, having been under one for so many months, after the fantastic efforts of the British people, it is now above one"". And that is it. The Liaison Committee has ended and back to No 10 the PM goes.  Select CommitteeParliament The next question comes from Conservative MP, Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence committee. He asks whether more use could be made of the Ministry of Defence in the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Johnson praises the ""outstanding"" officers he has met during the crisis, adding he was ""bowled over"" with the Army's efforts in distributing Covid tests. Mr Ellwood asks the PM to ""recognise the importance"" of conventional military equipment despite the need to invest more in areas such as cyber warfare. Mr Johnson says the UK is set for a ""fantastic time"" when it comes to shipbuilding. Select CommitteeParliament Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Select CommitteeParliament By video link, Labour's Sarah Champion asks whether the PM is looking to amend the International Development Act and what it constitutes as overseas aid within it. Johnson said he would ""reserve his position on amending the act"". But he adds: ""What we certainly want to do is ensure that ODA (overseas development assistance) is better spent on serving the interests... the diplomatic and the political values of the UK, and indeed the commercial and jobs interest of the UK."" Asked which regions may lose out as a result when such changes are made, the PM said it was ""like asking a lion to choose between its cubs"". He says he ""doesn't accept the idea"" that you need to remove parts of the world from the list to invest in others. Select CommitteeParliament Tom Tugendhat asks whether Japan should be allowed to join the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing pact between the UK and the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Johnson says this is not something Japan has raised with him, but it is an âidea weâre thinking about"". He adds it âmight be a productive wayâ to build on the UK's relationship with Japan. He cautions though that the group has its âparticular coherence,"" and the UK would have to work with its intelligence sharing partners over the proposal. Select CommitteeParliament For their last section, MPs are now questioning the PM about an ongoing review of the UK's foreign and security policies. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, asks whether the treatment of Uighur Muslims by the Chinese state in Xinjiang province ""amounts to genocide"". In reply, Mr Johnson says he finds their treatment ""objectionable,"" but genocide is an ""important term in international law"" and he doesn't believe the UK is so far in a position to use it regarding Xinjiang. He says he has raised the issue ""many times"" with ""our Chinese friends"". Reality Check Asked a few moments ago whether the EU was negotiating in good faith in talks on a future trade deal, the PM cited the fact that the bloc had so far refused to give the UK a  ""third country"" licence to export products of animal origin to the continent. Mr Johnson has raised the spectre in recent days of British food exports to mainland Europe and Northern Ireland, including lamb, beef and clotted cream, being effectively ""blockaded"". But how likely is this? The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morrishas been looking into the issue and the connection between this and the current political row over the Internal Markers Bill. He says a blockade seems ""highly unlikely"" since the EU Withdrawal Agreement contains safeguard measures which allow either side to act if the application of the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing ""serious economic difficulties that are liable to persist"". Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Astonishingly the Prime Minister couldn't answer whether one of his own law officers was still in post - the matter ofLord Keen's resignation,which he offered this morning, was still an 'ongoing' situation, the PM said. Around his preparation for this committee, Boris Johnson's been having various conversations about his Internal Market Bill, which has provoked anger among some Tory MPs and from the EU. Sir Bob Neill - who's leading efforts to amend it - was one of those questioning the PM this afternoon, but they didn't divulge the details of their private discussions. It looks like they might have reached a compromise behind the scenes that could head off a possible rebellion. But Boris Johnson doubled down on his controversial step of seeking to breach the Brexit divorce deal - saying, provocatively, that he believed the EU had been negotiating in bad faith. Select CommitteeParliament Meg Hillier comes back in to ask which of the PM's ministers is right - the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who said the bill only breaks international law if the power is used, or Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who said it breaks international law just by granting the power. Johnson will not be drawn on an answer. Instead, he replies: ""My position is the Attorney General's position and the objective of these measures is to protect this country against accidental or unreasonable measures that serve to break up the UK."" Select CommitteeParliament Next up is Conservative MP Sir Robert Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee. He asks the PM what ""practical steps"" negotiators are taking to ensure the UK continues to have access to judicial co-operation procedures with the EU, such as criminal databases, after its transition period. Mr Johnson says he won't ""go into detail"" on the negotiations but there is ""ample scope"" to continue co-operation with the 27-country bloc. Sir Bob asks for an update on efforts to get a so-called ""adequacy"" ruling from the EU, which would mean it deems UK data protection law reliable enough to share data cross-border.

He asks the PM why the existing withdrawal agreement does not do enough to allay his fears and he needs this bill. Johnson says the new legislation ""provides belt and braces protection"" and a ""water tight bulkhead"". He says he believes it is the ""only way... to provide the certainty and the protections that we are talking about"" when it comes to UK trade between its nations. Asked a number of times whether he believes the EU are negotiating in ""good faith"", the PM eventually replies: ""I don't believe they are.

BBC Scotland earlier reported that Lord Keen - the government's chief lawyer for the nation - had offered his resignation to Boris Johnson. But, at the time, it was unclear whether it was going to be accepted by No 10. And even in the Liaison Committee, the PM said ""conversations were continuing"" over whether he would stay on or not. Peculiar language? Now, a statement has dropped from No 10 and it is now official he has quit. A Downing Street spokesman said: âLord Keen has resigned as Advocate
General for Scotland. The prime minister thanks him for his service.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Select CommitteeParliament A couple of follow up questions which the prime minister agrees to stay and answer before the session comes to a close. The SNP's Angus MacNeil asks who will be responsible ifreports of long lorry queues in Kent come to fruition after Brexit. ""I don't think anybody has any illusions who is going to be held to account,"" says Johnson. ""It is certainly going to be me."" And finally, his Conservative colleague Greg Clark asks him what the PM is monitoring to ensure young people, who are making ""huge sacrifices"" will be allowed out of the ""rule of six"" measure sooner rather than later. Johnson says the ""single most important fact is what is the R doing, where is the R going"". R is the reproduction number, or R value, for Covid-19. Johnson continues, ""And alas, alas, alas, having been under one for so many months, after the fantastic efforts of the British people, it is now above one"". And that is it. The Liaison Committee has ended and back to No 10 the PM goes.  Select CommitteeParliament The next question comes from Conservative MP, Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence committee. He asks whether more use could be made of the Ministry of Defence in the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Johnson praises the ""outstanding"" officers he has met during the crisis, adding he was ""bowled over"" with the Army's efforts in distributing Covid tests. Mr Ellwood asks the PM to ""recognise the importance"" of conventional military equipment despite the need to invest more in areas such as cyber warfare. Mr Johnson says the UK is set for a ""fantastic time"" when it comes to shipbuilding. Select CommitteeParliament Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Select CommitteeParliament By video link, Labour's Sarah Champion asks whether the PM is looking to amend the International Development Act and what it constitutes as overseas aid within it. Johnson said he would ""reserve his position on amending the act"". But he adds: ""What we certainly want to do is ensure that ODA (overseas development assistance) is better spent on serving the interests... the diplomatic and the political values of the UK, and indeed the commercial and jobs interest of the UK."" Asked which regions may lose out as a result when such changes are made, the PM said it was ""like asking a lion to choose between its cubs"". He says he ""doesn't accept the idea"" that you need to remove parts of the world from the list to invest in others. Select CommitteeParliament Tom Tugendhat asks whether Japan should be allowed to join the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing pact between the UK and the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Johnson says this is not something Japan has raised with him, but it is an âidea weâre thinking about"". He adds it âmight be a productive wayâ to build on the UK's relationship with Japan. He cautions though that the group has its âparticular coherence,"" and the UK would have to work with its intelligence sharing partners over the proposal. Select CommitteeParliament For their last section, MPs are now questioning the PM about an ongoing review of the UK's foreign and security policies. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, asks whether the treatment of Uighur Muslims by the Chinese state in Xinjiang province ""amounts to genocide"". In reply, Mr Johnson says he finds their treatment ""objectionable,"" but genocide is an ""important term in international law"" and he doesn't believe the UK is so far in a position to use it regarding Xinjiang. He says he has raised the issue ""many times"" with ""our Chinese friends"". Reality Check Asked a few moments ago whether the EU was negotiating in good faith in talks on a future trade deal, the PM cited the fact that the bloc had so far refused to give the UK a  ""third country"" licence to export products of animal origin to the continent. Mr Johnson has raised the spectre in recent days of British food exports to mainland Europe and Northern Ireland, including lamb, beef and clotted cream, being effectively ""blockaded"". But how likely is this? The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morrishas been looking into the issue and the connection between this and the current political row over the Internal Markers Bill. He says a blockade seems ""highly unlikely"" since the EU Withdrawal Agreement contains safeguard measures which allow either side to act if the application of the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing ""serious economic difficulties that are liable to persist"". Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Astonishingly the Prime Minister couldn't answer whether one of his own law officers was still in post - the matter ofLord Keen's resignation,which he offered this morning, was still an 'ongoing' situation, the PM said. Around his preparation for this committee, Boris Johnson's been having various conversations about his Internal Market Bill, which has provoked anger among some Tory MPs and from the EU. Sir Bob Neill - who's leading efforts to amend it - was one of those questioning the PM this afternoon, but they didn't divulge the details of their private discussions. It looks like they might have reached a compromise behind the scenes that could head off a possible rebellion. But Boris Johnson doubled down on his controversial step of seeking to breach the Brexit divorce deal - saying, provocatively, that he believed the EU had been negotiating in bad faith. Select CommitteeParliament Meg Hillier comes back in to ask which of the PM's ministers is right - the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who said the bill only breaks international law if the power is used, or Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who said it breaks international law just by granting the power. Johnson will not be drawn on an answer. Instead, he replies: ""My position is the Attorney General's position and the objective of these measures is to protect this country against accidental or unreasonable measures that serve to break up the UK."" Select CommitteeParliament Next up is Conservative MP Sir Robert Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee. He asks the PM what ""practical steps"" negotiators are taking to ensure the UK continues to have access to judicial co-operation procedures with the EU, such as criminal databases, after its transition period. Mr Johnson says he won't ""go into detail"" on the negotiations but there is ""ample scope"" to continue co-operation with the 27-country bloc. Sir Bob asks for an update on efforts to get a so-called ""adequacy"" ruling from the EU, which would mean it deems UK data protection law reliable enough to share data cross-border. Mr Johnson says he hopes an agreement in this area can be found by the end of the transition, but does not mention a specific deadline. Select CommitteeParliament The SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil continues with the Brexit theme. He asks the PM how many Japan style trade deals the UK needs to ""make up the damage Brexit has given us"". Johnson again says he doesn't ""accept the characterisation"", and says post-Brexit, the UK will be ""at the heart of a great cats cradle of deals around the world"". MacNeil asks whether pushing his UK Internal Market Bill is a ""price worth paying"" aftercriticism from the likes of Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. In a tetchy exchange, the SNP MP warns it could mean losing out on a trade deal with those across the Atlantic. Johnson says he has the ""upmost respect"" for the US politicians criticising the law. But, he adds: ""I think when they understand and see what we are trying to do, they would share ambition and concern about protecting the balance and symmetry of the UK."" Select CommitteeParliament Sticking with Brexit, next up is Sir William Cash, who chairs the European Scrutiny Committee. He says the PM's plans tooverride sections of the withdrawal agreementin a bill is not unprecedented, saying he has around 20 examples of previous UK laws that have done this. He also says there are examples of the EU breaking international law itself, and accuses the bloc of ""double standards"" in its protests over the issue. In reply, the prime ministers says the bill is required to protect the UK internal market from the EU making ""extreme"" interpretations of the sections of the Brexit divorce deal relating to Northern Ireland. Select CommitteeParliament Benn - who chairs the Commons committee on the UK's future relationship with the EU - focuses his questioning on Internal Market Bill. He asks the PM why the existing withdrawal agreement does not do enough to allay his fears and he needs this bill. Johnson says the new legislation ""provides belt and braces protection"" and a ""water tight bulkhead"". He says he believes it is the ""only way... to provide the certainty and the protections that we are talking about"" when it comes to UK trade between its nations. Asked a number of times whether he believes the EU are negotiating in ""good faith"", the PM eventually replies: ""I don't believe they are. ""It is always possible I am mistaken, and perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong. ""But I prefer to have protections."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Vulnerable children who require urgent support will ""slip out of view"" because of the impact of coronavirus, England's children's commissioner has warned. Anne Longfield has called for central investment in youth work to help handle problems exacerbated by lockdown. An estimatedtwo million childrenin England live in homes affected by substance abuse, domestic violence or mental health issues. The government said their safety and wellbeing had always been a priority. Anne Longfield is concerned some children with significant emotional and educational needs may never get over setbacks experienced during lockdown With children having returned to schools across England teachers will begin to identify children who are at risk, leading to an expected increase in referrals to social services, the commissioner told the BBC. She said: ""After the school six-week holidays it's always the case that there are spikes in referrals to social services for children so, after six months, we should expect there to be a really significant increase in the number of children who there are concerns about. ""It will need investment, be it from the police and crime commissioners or indeed from central government to really look at long term, I would say youth work, with these individual children because there's a danger that in five years' time we look back and there's a generation of very vulnerable teens that we let just slip out of view at this time with terrible long term consequences."" Ms Longfield called for further resources to help youth workers engage with young people who may have drifted away from the education system, leaving them at risk of being targeted by criminal gangs. Carl Morton from the St Giles Trust says the charity works to keep children away from county lines, gangs, drugs and violence The St Giles Trust works with teenagers who have been excluded from schools and said it was anticipating a doubling of referrals to its services in the coming weeks. Carl Morton, who works for the charity, said: ""All of a sudden these kids are back out now, so whether it's criminal activity or grooming of gang [members], we're going to see an influx of it. ""It then means we're going to get referrals for these children to work with St Giles."" Thirteen-year-old Jake (not his real name) had just started at a specialist school in Leeds for children with behavioural problems when lockdown was announced in March. ""[Lockdown] was hard, there was nowt to do really, I was just sat in the same spot all the time, not being able to go out or see all your mates,"" he said. ""Without St Giles I was getting into bother, I was going out with the wrong people. ""Now that I've met these it's calmed me down. I'm not going out as much as what I was doing, doing bad stuff. ""They've given me a laptop to learn at home on, they give us vouchers for food, gym equipment. ""It's just been easier."" Ms Longfield added: ""I want children to be at the forefront of the recovery and get the emotional help and support and the educational support they need to be able to recover and get ahead. ""Otherwise, we'll have a generation of children who will have had difficulties and setbacks during this period that they may take years to get over, if for some they ever do."" In response, a government spokesperson said: ""The safety and wellbeing of the most vulnerable children has always been our priority, which is why throughout the pandemic schools, nurseries and colleges remained open to them. ""Our advice for schools is clear that they should continue to identify and report any abuse or harm for children in schools as well as those learning remotely.""

"Joe Biden has said he will not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"" if he is elected US President in November. The Democratic candidate said any UK-US trade deal had to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been trying to reassure US politicians about the latest Brexit developments during a trip to Washington. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he trusted the UK to ""get this right"". But US Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there was ""no chance"" of a UK-US trade deal getting through the US Congress if the UK violated international agreements, undermining the Good Friday Agreement. After a meeting with Mr Raab, the Speaker of the House of Representatives said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to ""imperil"" peace in Northern Ireland.

Brexit is high on the agenda at the Washington meetings, after the Internal Market Billcleared its first parliamentary hurdleearlier this week. The proposed law would give the UK government the power to override part of the Brexit withdrawal deal - which Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October. This video can not be played The Good Friday Agreement: A brief guide It now faces further scrutiny in the House of Commons, and also needs to be passed by the House of Lords. If the law comes into force, it would breach international law - a prospect that prompted an angry response from senior figures in the US last week. Mr Biden hosts a reception for then Irish PM Enda Kenny and wife Fionnuala in 2014 By BBC Northern Ireland Dublin Correspondent Shane Harrison Joe Biden is a proud Irish American with roots in counties Louth and Londonderry on his mother's side. He takes a keen interest in Irish affairs and frequently peppers his speeches with quotes from Irish poets. When he was Barack Obama's Vice President he hosted successive Irish prime ministers during the St Patrick's day festivities and has been known to holiday and play golf in Ireland with some of the republic's leaders. So his comments about the Good Friday Agreement should come as no surprise. Indeed they largely echo concerns expressed by senior Democrat politicians in Congress to British ministers about the impact Brexit may have on the peace process. The only difference is Joe Biden may soon be elected President of the United States - still the most powerful country in the world. On Tuesday, four senior congressmen also issued a similar warning, saying a UK-US trade deal would be blocked if the UK failed to preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement. The letter was signed by Democratic congressmen Eliot Engel, Richard Neal, and Bill Keating, who all chair committees in the US House of Representatives, as well as Republican Congressman Peter King. How could the Brexit deal change? What is the Northern Ireland protocol PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons However, asked about the bill at a joint UK-US press conference Mr Pompeo said: ""We trust the UK, we know the complexities of the situation, I have great confidence they will get this right."" Mr Raab said ""the threat to the Good Friday Agreement comes from the EU's politicisation of the issue"". He defended the bill as ""precautionary and proportionate"" adding ""what we can't have is the EU seeking to erect a border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain"". Asked earlier about the letter from US politicians, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think when they understand what we are trying to do they will share our ambition and concern which is to protect the peace process."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, said the ""rhetoric coming from Washington is growing increasingly ridiculous"". He said if a post-Brexit trade deal were allowed to lead to new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, this would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement. ""Do unionist voices not matter in [Washington ] DC, or is it just about the Irish-American vote rather than peace in Belfast?,"" he added. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 By BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack This is not the first time that Brexit and the peace accord's paths have crossed. During negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,some claimed a hard borderbetween NI and the Republic of Ireland would breach the Good Friday Agreement. But critics of that argument point out thatthe text does not contain an explicit commitment,externalnever to harden the border, and there is nothing about customs posts or regulatory controls. The only place in which it alludes to infrastructure at the border is in the section on security, which cites ""the removal of security installations"". Unionists say the real breach of the deal is the NI Protocol, which instead places an economic border in the Irish Sea. They claim it breaks the Good Friday Agreement, as it does not have the consent of both communities. What this latest argument is really about is whether the government's new Brexit plans for Northern Ireland breach the ""spirit"" of the peace deal. That in itself is open to interpretation - but is widely understood to be a spirit of non-violence, consent and partnership. That's what has prompted the intervention from several prominent US politicians, and debate over this is likely to deepen as Brexit talks move towards a conclusion. In his talks on Wednesday, Mr Raab argued that the government's plans are precautionary and proportionate - and in response to what ministers describe as threats from the EU to block food imports. Mr Raab also met Mr Pompeo, amid continuing transatlantic tensions over Iran. The US secretary of state recently accused the UK and its European allies of ""siding with the Ayatollahs"" for blocking further United Nations sanctions on Iran. What just happened with Brexit?

"Kim Kardashian West and dozens of other celebrities have announced they will freeze their social media accounts to protest against the spread of ""hate, propaganda and misinformation"". ""Misinformation shared on social media has a serious impact,"" Kardashian West wrote in a statement on Tuesday. The move is part of the #StopHateforProfit campaign which was organised by civil rights activists. The celebrities will freeze their accounts for 24 hours on Wednesday.

"The new Wylfa power station would have been built next to the old power plant on Anglesey Plans for a Â£15-Â£20bn nuclear power plant in Wales have been scrapped. Work on the Wylfa Newydd project on Angleseywas suspended in January last yearbecause of rising costs after Hitachi failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government. Hitachi has now confirmed it is withdrawing from the project, after Isle of Anglesey council said it had received the news on Tuesday. It would have created up to 9,000 jobs during construction. Hitachi said it made the decision given 20 months had passed since the project had paused ""and the investment environment has become increasingly severe due to the impact of Covid-19"". UK government could take stake in Sizewell Minister for Economy and North Wales Ken Skates said: ""The news from Hitachi today is deeply disappointing. ""There has been a tremendous effort by Horizon Nuclear Power, Ynys Mon Council, the North Wales region and all our partners to bring this important project forward. Now is the time to continue with this strong partnership and build upon those efforts. ""We must not lose sight that Wylfa remains one the best sites in the UK for new nuclear development."" Work on Wylfa was due to start this year Hitachi said it would coordinate with the UK government and other bodies over handling the planned construction sites and other matters. Developer Horizon's chief executive Duncan Hawthorne said: ""I understand this announcement will be disappointing for our many supporters who had hoped to see our project through to completion and I would personally like to thank you for your support throughout our time on this project. Donald Trump plea over Wylfa nuclear project sale dismissed Wylfa Newydd and the energy gap What's Wylfa - and why is it so important? ""Nuclear power has a critical role to play in helping tackle our energy needs, meeting our climate change targets and levelling up the economy through green growth and job creation."" Hitachi is also scrapping its project at Oldbury on Severn in Gloucestershire despite describing both sites as ""highly desirable"" for new nuclear plants. Mr Hawthorne said: ""We will do our utmost to facilitate the prospects for development which will bring the major local, national and environmental benefits that nuclear can uniquely deliver as we push to transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2050."" The UK government said it remained committed to nuclear power and recognised the announcement was ""very disappointing news"" for the people of north Wales. ""Nuclear power will play a key role in the UK's future energy mix as we transition to a low-carbon economy, including through our investments in small and advanced modular reactors,"" a spokesperson said. ""That's why we previously offered a significant package of potential support to this project that went well beyond what any government has been willing to consider in the past. ""This included taking a one third equity stake, providing all of the required debt financing to complete construction, and providing generous financial support through our Contract for Difference scheme."" The UK government said it remains willing to discuss a replacement for the original Wylfa plant, which shut in 2015 after 44 years of service, with viable companies. There has been a long campaign against a new nuclear station Anglesey council was told on Tuesday that Hitachi was withdrawing, and council leader Llinos Medi said: ""This is very disappointing, particularly at such a difficult time economically."" However campaigners against the project have welcomed Hitachi's move claiming a new nuclear power station would have ""endangered lives on Anglesey and beyond"". The People Against Wylfa B action group said: ""It would have ruined the environment over an area which is 10 times greater than the current site."" It called on Hitachi to ""ensure that no nuclear scheme will happen on the site in the future"" and return the site to its ""former state, for community benefit"".

"Joe Biden has said he will not allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"" if he is elected US President in November. The Democratic candidate said any UK-US trade deal had to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been trying to reassure US politicians about the latest Brexit developments during a trip to Washington. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he trusted the UK to ""get this right"". But US Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there was ""no chance"" of a UK-US trade deal getting through the US Congress if the UK violated international agreements, undermining the Good Friday Agreement. After a meeting with Mr Raab, the Speaker of the House of Representatives said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to ""imperil"" peace in Northern Ireland.

Brexit is high on the agenda at the Washington meetings, after the Internal Market Billcleared its first parliamentary hurdleearlier this week. The proposed law would give the UK government the power to override part of the Brexit withdrawal deal - which Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed with the EU last October. This video can not be played The Good Friday Agreement: A brief guide It now faces further scrutiny in the House of Commons, and also needs to be passed by the House of Lords. If the law comes into force, it would breach international law - a prospect that prompted an angry response from senior figures in the US last week. Mr Biden hosts a reception for then Irish PM Enda Kenny and wife Fionnuala in 2014 By BBC Northern Ireland Dublin Correspondent Shane Harrison Joe Biden is a proud Irish American with roots in counties Louth and Londonderry on his mother's side. He takes a keen interest in Irish affairs and frequently peppers his speeches with quotes from Irish poets. When he was Barack Obama's Vice President he hosted successive Irish prime ministers during the St Patrick's day festivities and has been known to holiday and play golf in Ireland with some of the republic's leaders. So his comments about the Good Friday Agreement should come as no surprise. Indeed they largely echo concerns expressed by senior Democrat politicians in Congress to British ministers about the impact Brexit may have on the peace process. The only difference is Joe Biden may soon be elected President of the United States - still the most powerful country in the world. On Tuesday, four senior congressmen also issued a similar warning, saying a UK-US trade deal would be blocked if the UK failed to preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement. The letter was signed by Democratic congressmen Eliot Engel, Richard Neal, and Bill Keating, who all chair committees in the US House of Representatives, as well as Republican Congressman Peter King. How could the Brexit deal change? What is the Northern Ireland protocol PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle in Commons However, asked about the bill at a joint UK-US press conference Mr Pompeo said: ""We trust the UK, we know the complexities of the situation, I have great confidence they will get this right."" Mr Raab said ""the threat to the Good Friday Agreement comes from the EU's politicisation of the issue"". He defended the bill as ""precautionary and proportionate"" adding ""what we can't have is the EU seeking to erect a border down the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Britain"". Asked earlier about the letter from US politicians, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think when they understand what we are trying to do they will share our ambition and concern which is to protect the peace process."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party at Westminster, said the ""rhetoric coming from Washington is growing increasingly ridiculous"". He said if a post-Brexit trade deal were allowed to lead to new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, this would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement. ""Do unionist voices not matter in [Washington ] DC, or is it just about the Irish-American vote rather than peace in Belfast?,"" he added. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 By BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack This is not the first time that Brexit and the peace accord's paths have crossed. During negotiations on the withdrawal agreement,some claimed a hard borderbetween NI and the Republic of Ireland would breach the Good Friday Agreement. But critics of that argument point out thatthe text does not contain an explicit commitment,externalnever to harden the border, and there is nothing about customs posts or regulatory controls. The only place in which it alludes to infrastructure at the border is in the section on security, which cites ""the removal of security installations"". Unionists say the real breach of the deal is the NI Protocol, which instead places an economic border in the Irish Sea. They claim it breaks the Good Friday Agreement, as it does not have the consent of both communities. What this latest argument is really about is whether the government's new Brexit plans for Northern Ireland breach the ""spirit"" of the peace deal. That in itself is open to interpretation - but is widely understood to be a spirit of non-violence, consent and partnership. That's what has prompted the intervention from several prominent US politicians, and debate over this is likely to deepen as Brexit talks move towards a conclusion. In his talks on Wednesday, Mr Raab argued that the government's plans are precautionary and proportionate - and in response to what ministers describe as threats from the EU to block food imports. Mr Raab also met Mr Pompeo, amid continuing transatlantic tensions over Iran. The US secretary of state recently accused the UK and its European allies of ""siding with the Ayatollahs"" for blocking further United Nations sanctions on Iran. What just happened with Brexit?

"Healthcare officials have been carrying out oxygen level testing across India The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in India has surpassed five million, officials say, the second-highest in the world after the US. The virus appears to be spreading much faster in India than any other country, with daily cases crossing 90,000 for the five days up until Tuesday. More than 80,000 people have died, amid reports of shortages of intensive care beds and oxygen supplies. But the death rate is lower than in many countries with a high caseload. The rise in infections comes as the government continues to lift restrictions throughout the country to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. Gyms are the latest to reopen, while schools, colleges and cinema halls remain shut. But most workplaces and markets are back to normal, and many cities are permitting restaurants and bars to resume serving alcohol, which is likely to increase crowds. 'I recovered but I fear Covid might still kill me' Rumours hamper testing in India Tracking the global pandemic Is low testing hiding scale of South Asia outbreak? In the initial stages of Covid-19, India appeared to be doing fairly well, imposing a strict lockdown, but the virus then hit megacities like Mumbai and the capital, Delhi, before surging in smaller cities and rural areas. Despite the increase, the government has eased restrictions to recover from the effects of an early lockdown - between March and June - that hit the economy hard. As India opens up and people return to work, Covid-19 cases have been surging. Some 600,000 cases were added just last week. India's caseload now stands at 5,020,359 after it added 90,123 cases in the last 24 hours. Although the virus has spread to every corner of the country, including the remote tribe in India's Andaman islands, the bulk of the caseload is coming from five states. Coronavirus rumours hamper testing in Punjab India faces oxygen scarcity as Covid-19 cases surge Recovering from Covid-19: 'I can't get the images out of my head' How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing? Why won't India admit how Covid-19 is spreading? Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh also account for more than 60% of the active cases. But the rise in case numbers is partly also a reflection of increased testing - India has been conducting more than a million tests a day. With the rise in number of cases, demand for oxygen has risen exponentially recently. Hospitals and care centres have been consuming up to 2,700 tonnes of oxygen every day this month, compared with 750 tonnes in April, according to data obtained from All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association. Large hospitals depend on liquid oxygen with backup cylinders Oxygen manufacturers say the demand for industrial oxygen has also shot up because more factories are now reopening. It is a lives-versus-livelihoods question that India is grappling with now,BBC India correspondent Soutik Biswas reports. India will now need to increase capacity to make sure that both industries and patients do not suffer, our correspondent adds. Most oxygen plants are built near cities and big towns. So supplies to far-flung districts where Covid-19 patients are filling hospitals have to be sent by special lorries carrying cryogenic tanks - India has some 1,500 such vehicles. Many areas - the capital, Delhi, for example - do not have a single oxygen manufacturer, and all supplies have to come from neighbouring regions. India has reported 82,066 Covid-19 deaths so far, and has been recording around 1,000 deaths daily in recent weeks. While that's the world's fifth-highest tally in absolute numbers, it amounts to about 60 deaths per million of the population.  And India's case fatality rate, a measure of deaths among Covid-19 patients, is just 1.6%. For the US, it is about 3% and UK's is around 11%. Many epidemiologists attribute the low death rate to a young population. Other South Asian countries with young populations are also reporting low mortality rates - some even lower than India's. Some experts also believe that several states are undercounting deaths. And they also cite the fact that a handful of states are heavily attributing Covid-19 deaths to patients' underlying conditions or co-morbidities. But they add thatit's hard to measure the scale of undercountingwithout reliable historical data and calculation of excess deaths. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"Lego will start replacing plastic packaging with paper bags from 2021 as the toy brick maker aims to become more sustainable. Lego said it had been prompted by letters from children asking it to remove the single-use plastic bags. It said it would be investing up to $400m (Â£310m) over three years to improve its sustainability efforts. Lego bricks themselves are made of plastic, although the company is exploring alternative materials. ""We have received many letters from children about the environment asking us to remove single-use plastic packaging,"" Lego Group chief executive Niels B Christiansen said. ""We have been exploring alternatives for some time and the passion and ideas from children inspired us to begin to make the change,""  he added. From next year the toy company will start introducing recyclable paper bags, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to package its loose bricks. Lego set to open 120 new stores despite pandemic Price of plastic carrier bags in England to double to 10p next year Lockdown Lego: The enthusiasts building mini masterpieces This is part of Lego's ambition to make all its packaging sustainable by the end of 2025. ""Children liked the paper bags being trialled in 2021 as they were environmentally friendly and easy to open,"" Mr Christiansen added. Pressure has been growing on retailers to reduce their use of plastic bags and packaging. However it is not always straightforward to ensure alternatives aren't more carbon intensive to produce, transport and recycle. Lego said its investment would also go into educational programmes and efforts to make the company more sustainable in other areas. In 2015, the Danish firm set a target to make its products from sustainable materials by 2030. As part of this pledge it will expand the use of bio-bricks, such as those using sugar cane as a component. Earlier this month Lego said sales and profits had risen in the first half of this year as consumers bought more of their products during lockdowns to restrict the spread of coronavirus. It said families bought bigger and more complicated Lego sets to keep themselves busy. The toy maker plans still plans to open 120 new Lego stores around the world this year despite the pandemic which saw most bricks-and-mortar shops closed for extended periods.

"Plans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days, the justice secretary has said. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Robert Buckland said. Resolving delays with testing was ""the number one issue"", he added. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said each school was given 10 home-testing kits at the start of term and could now order more from today. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the prime minister had ""time and again"" made pledges on testing but ""then breaks those promises"". Standing in for party leader Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs, she told the House of Commons: ""They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises. ""The health secretary said yesterday it would take weeks to sort this situation out. We don't have weeks."" Mr Johnson defended the government's record, saying the UK had ""done more tests than any other European country"". He said it was trying to meet a ""colossal spike"" in demand at ""record speed"", adding that 89% of tests done in person were being returned the next day. All you need to know about testing Fact checked: Three government claims on testing UK coronavirus cases up by 3,105 on Tuesday Speaking earlier to BBC Breakfast, Mr Buckland said testing centres would be increasing from about 400 to 500 in the next few weeks. As well as prioritising tests for the NHS and then social care, he said schools were also important because of their ""knock-on effect to the working lives of parents and carers"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will announce who will be prioritised for tests in the next few days. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings and beingdirected to test sites hundreds of milesfrom home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Test slots are limited because, while there seem to be enough testing sites, there are bottlenecks in labs for processing swabs, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. A new lab is due to be up and running but that could be a few weeks away - and until thenministers say current problems are likely to continue. Bolton NHS Trust in Greater Manchester said thatmore than 100 people had turned up to accident and emergencyon Tuesday asking for a test. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We're working around the clock to make sure everyone who needs a test can get a test"" Mr Hancock, speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, said rising demand for tests meant the government was ""having to prioritise once again and I do not shirk from decisions about prioritisation"". Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but Mr Hancock said it was ""less than a day's capacity"". That means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. The Department of Health has said about a quarter of people requesting tests have no need to do so - and only those with relevant symptoms should book. Some closed for a period days after reopening while others have told classes and whole year groups - many of which form one bubble  - to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Teaching unions have called for the education sector to be prioritised for the allocation of tests to ensure schools remain open. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said if issues with testing capacity were not fixed keeping schools open would become ""unsustainable"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme head teachers would have to decide whether a bubble stays at home if a pupil or teacher showed Covid-19 symptoms and could not get a test to prove they were negative. It would feel like lockdown ""by default"", he said, and be more frustrating for parents as it is unpredictable. The ASCL, along with two other unions representing head teachers and governors - NAHT and the National Governance Association - has written to the PM expressing concern over the delays, saying school leaders are in an ""impossible situation"". Nearly 300 pupils sent home after positive test School figures show 88% back for start of term Can my child go to school with a cold? Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on Wednesday he had emphasised the importance of prioritising schools to Baroness Harding, head of the UK testing system. He said they had this morning opened a schools ordering system to access tests directly from the NHS. Cafe owners Scott Vining and his wife worry testing delays mean they will have to close their family business Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. ""We've tried hundreds of times,"" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. ""We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all."" 'How am I supposed to get my family of eight tested?' At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family of four, the spaces had disappeared. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to people trying to get tests at a centre in Oldham Maria Aziz, from west London, has been trying to book a test since Sunday, when her nine-year-old daughter, Mishal, complained of a sore throat. By 04:00 Monday, her daughter had developed a fever. She said she had spent three days trying and failing to book a test. Her eldest daughter, Eimann, 14, also had to be withdrawn from school while she tried to book a test for her younger daughter. ""I'm trying through the government website and then yesterday there was also a number on the website to call - 119 - so I tried that as well. Each time there were no tests available. No home kits. No walk-in slots. No drive-through slots. Nothing."" YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? FURLOUGH:What happens when the scheme ends? Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according to government figures for Monday. The government said its UK laboratory daily testing capacity was more than 370,000 as of last week - which includes antibody tests and those tests used by scientists to estimate how widespread the virus is. Testing capacity (excluding antibody tests and virus spread testing) is about 245,000 a day. Government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic, The aim is to increase capacity to 500,000 a day by the end of October. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (""capacity"") and the number of tests actually processed. Analysis from Our World In Data, a research team based at the University of Oxford, suggests the UK is now performing more tests than many other countries. For example, the seven-day average up until 10 September showed the UK had carried out 2.8 tests per 1,000 people. This was ahead of European countries including France (2.1) and Spain and Germany (both 1.8). TASTE AND SMELL:How are they connected? RETURN TO FILMING:How has filming EastEnders changed?

"Artwork: D-Orbit's carrier platform has cameras that could also look for nearby space debris New approaches to tracking satellites and debris in orbit are to get a boost from the UK Space Agency. UKSA is giving over Â£1m to seven firms to help advance novel sensor technologies and the smart algorithms needed to interpret their data. Finding better ways to surveil objects moving overhead has become a high priority issue. With more and more satellites being launched, there's growing concern about the potential for collisions. A big worry is the burgeoning population of redundant hardware and junk in orbit - some 900,000 objects larger than 1cm by some counts, and all of it capable of doing immense damage to, or even destroying, an operational spacecraft in a high-velocity encounter. UK takes Â£400m stake in satellite firm OneWeb Europe's new space budget to enable CO2 mapping UK satellite tracks 'space junk' The projects being supported by UKSA come from a mix of start-ups and more established companies. The overriding goal is to improve ways to spot, characterise and track objects. Ultimately, this is information which could be fed into the automated traffic management systems of the future that will keep functioning satellites out of harm's way. The funded projects include: Lift Me Off:To develop machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques to distinguish between satellites and space junk. Fujitsu:To also develop machine-learning approaches and quantum-inspired processing to improve mission planning to remove debris. DeimosandNorthern Space and Security:To both develop a new range of optical sensors to track space objects from the UK. Andor:To enhance the sensitivity and speed of its camera detector technology to map and track ever smaller sized debris objects. D-Orbit UK:To refine the use of recently launched sensors to capture images of, and characterise, objects moving around a spacecraft. Lumi Space:The company is developing laser ranging technology to again spot, characterise and precisely track objects in orbit. Deimos is developing technologies to track space objects from the UK ""We've known for a long while that the space environment is getting more difficult, more cluttered,"" said Jacob Geer from UKSA. ""Space surveillance and tracking is one of the key things we can do to keep safe those satellites we rely on now, and to make sure certain orbits don't become inaccessible for future generations because there's too much debris in them. ""We had 26 proposals come to us and I think we've selected a good cross-section of ideas in the seven companies we're supporting,"" he told BBC News. While a lot of these projects are still at the lab stage, D-Orbit's work is dedicated to pushing the capability of some of its hardware already in space. The company recently launched a vehicle to carry and deploy a clutch of small satellites. This vehicle uses cameras to photograph its surroundings and to map the stars for the purposes of navigation. D-Orbit has the idea of using the cameras' imagery to also identify passing junk. ""One of the challenges in using star trackers is filtering out objects that are not supposed to be there - obviously, because you're trying to compare what you can see against a star catalogue,"" explained D-Orbit's Simon Reid. ""And, of course, it's those extra objects which in principal are the things that are potentially debris."" The funding announcement also coincides with the signing of a new partnership agreement between the Ministry of Defence and UKSA to work together on space domain awareness. Both have valuable assets and interests in orbit that need protecting. And for the UK taxpayer, this investment was recently deepened with the purchase out of bankruptcy of the OneWeb satellite broadband company. The UK government is now the part owner of one of the biggest spacecraft networks in the sky. OneWeb has so far launched 74 satellites in its communications constellation, with plans to put up thousands more. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""Millions of pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth present a significant threat to UK satellite systems which provide the vital services that we all take for granted - from mobile communications to weather forecasting. ""By developing new AI and sensor technology, the seven pioneering space projects we are backing today will significantly strengthen the UK's capabilities to monitor these hazardous space objects, helping to create new jobs and protect the services we rely on in our everyday lives.""

"Healthcare officials have been carrying out oxygen level testing across India The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in India has surpassed five million, officials say, the second-highest in the world after the US. The virus appears to be spreading much faster in India than any other country, with daily cases crossing 90,000 for the five days up until Tuesday. More than 80,000 people have died, amid reports of shortages of intensive care beds and oxygen supplies. But the death rate is lower than in many countries with a high caseload. The rise in infections comes as the government continues to lift restrictions throughout the country to try to boost an economy that lost millions of jobs when the virus hit in March. Gyms are the latest to reopen, while schools, colleges and cinema halls remain shut. But most workplaces and markets are back to normal, and many cities are permitting restaurants and bars to resume serving alcohol, which is likely to increase crowds. 'I recovered but I fear Covid might still kill me' Rumours hamper testing in India Tracking the global pandemic Is low testing hiding scale of South Asia outbreak? In the initial stages of Covid-19, India appeared to be doing fairly well, imposing a strict lockdown, but the virus then hit megacities like Mumbai and the capital, Delhi, before surging in smaller cities and rural areas. Despite the increase, the government has eased restrictions to recover from the effects of an early lockdown - between March and June - that hit the economy hard. As India opens up and people return to work, Covid-19 cases have been surging. Some 600,000 cases were added just last week. India's caseload now stands at 5,020,359 after it added 90,123 cases in the last 24 hours. Although the virus has spread to every corner of the country, including the remote tribe in India's Andaman islands, the bulk of the caseload is coming from five states. Coronavirus rumours hamper testing in Punjab India faces oxygen scarcity as Covid-19 cases surge Recovering from Covid-19: 'I can't get the images out of my head' How many Covid-19 deaths is India missing? Why won't India admit how Covid-19 is spreading? Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh also account for more than 60% of the active cases. But the rise in case numbers is partly also a reflection of increased testing - India has been conducting more than a million tests a day. With the rise in number of cases, demand for oxygen has risen exponentially recently. Hospitals and care centres have been consuming up to 2,700 tonnes of oxygen every day this month, compared with 750 tonnes in April, according to data obtained from All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association. Large hospitals depend on liquid oxygen with backup cylinders Oxygen manufacturers say the demand for industrial oxygen has also shot up because more factories are now reopening. It is a lives-versus-livelihoods question that India is grappling with now,BBC India correspondent Soutik Biswas reports. India will now need to increase capacity to make sure that both industries and patients do not suffer, our correspondent adds. Most oxygen plants are built near cities and big towns. So supplies to far-flung districts where Covid-19 patients are filling hospitals have to be sent by special lorries carrying cryogenic tanks - India has some 1,500 such vehicles. Many areas - the capital, Delhi, for example - do not have a single oxygen manufacturer, and all supplies have to come from neighbouring regions. India has reported 82,066 Covid-19 deaths so far, and has been recording around 1,000 deaths daily in recent weeks. While that's the world's fifth-highest tally in absolute numbers, it amounts to about 60 deaths per million of the population.  And India's case fatality rate, a measure of deaths among Covid-19 patients, is just 1.6%. For the US, it is about 3% and UK's is around 11%. Many epidemiologists attribute the low death rate to a young population. Other South Asian countries with young populations are also reporting low mortality rates - some even lower than India's. Some experts also believe that several states are undercounting deaths. And they also cite the fact that a handful of states are heavily attributing Covid-19 deaths to patients' underlying conditions or co-morbidities. But they add thatit's hard to measure the scale of undercountingwithout reliable historical data and calculation of excess deaths. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do?
