"The workers, who carry out picking and packing work, are being asked to remain on the farm during a period of isolation Up to 200 workers have been told to self-isolate on the farm where they pick crops after 73 of them tested positive for Covid-19. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co, in Herefordshire, has gone into lockdown after the positive tests. Food and other essential supplies are being delivered to the farm, where the workers have been segregated into the mobile homes they live in. The firm is also being supported by Public Health England (PHE). Herefordshire Council, which has organised the supply of deliveries, believes the outbreak is ""contained"" on the farm. The workers carry out picking and packing work during the harvesting season on the farm, just west of Malvern, in Worcestershire. The company said the welfare of its staff was its ""priority"" and further testing of management and visitors to the farm had so far produced negative test results. As a precaution, the workers are being treated as ""one extended bubble"" and are staying within household groups, the council said. Herefordshire Council said the workers are isolating in mobile homes on the site In a statement on its website, A S Green and Co said: ""Public Health England advises that it is very unlikely Covid-19 can be transmitted through food or food packaging, so shoppers can remain confident buying British fruit and veg."" The farm is currently closed to visitors. From 29 June to 5 July, Herefordshire had an average rate of two new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, figures from Public Health England show. This compares with Leicester, which had 116 cases per 100,000. Joan Cummins, BBC Midlands Today A S Green nestles in sight of the Malvern Hills in Herefordshire. The farm grows beans and broccoli and is a long established family run business in the area. It employs about 200 seasonal pickers and packers from Eastern Europe to help with the crop. A few workers could be seen in the distance wearing face coverings and walking to the entrance of the farm to collect shopping delivered by the local authority. I understand although a few of the workers had symptoms, most were asymptomatic and the positive results of 73 people came as a surprise to them. The Director of Public Health for Herefordshire said both the farm's owners and staff were co-operating with the health authorities. Katie Spence, PHE Midlands health protection director, said a range of infection control measures had been introduced, including on-site testing, social distancing in communal areas and the indoor packaging area. Workers are also being encouraged to wash their hands regularly and use face coverings in closed areas. ""Despite these measures, a small number of workers became symptomatic earlier this week and they and a few close contacts among the workforce were tested initially and found to be positive,"" she said. PHE said it is still awaiting a few final results of tests on the workforce. Hereford Council leader David Hitchiner said the virus is ""contained"" on the farm Karen Wright, director of public health for Herefordshire, said: ""Prompt testing on the farm has allowed us to understand transmission and control the spread of infection. ""We continue to support the farm management, their workers, who form an important part of our local economy, and the local community through this challenging time."" The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the industry takes this issue ""incredibly seriously"". ""Everything is being done to keep workers safe; their health and safety remains the priority,"" a spokesman said. ""Across the sector there have been significant investments this season; from the use of additional safety equipment and PPE, regularly testing temperatures, and following government guidance created specifically for seasonal workers."" Following the Pick for Britain campaign - an initiative to bring together UK workers and farmers to prevent crops rotting during the pandemic - the farm said it had received more than 300 applications. The farm's website says workers are expected to share accommodation at Rook Row Farm, while there is a recreational building with a pool table, dartboard and TV for all employees. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Why are there outbreaks in meat processing plants? Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry There has been a recent spike in cases atmeat processing plantsacross the UK and Europe. Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp are ""perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread"". The government hasissued guidelines,externalon working safely in food manufacturing. Overall, the Herefordshire council area has recorded 749 cases during lockdown, as of 7 July. Speaking to BBC Midlands Today, council leader David Hitchiner said: ""I would say we've got it contained, these people are not people who travel around the community, they tend to stay where they are. ""I don't physically know the site but I would hope it is quite isolated and so it shouldn't spread out among the community. ""The owners are keeping the workers there on the site and doing their very best to make sure it can't spread any further off this farm."" He added that expected PHE are now trying to trace the original source of the outbreak. EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"People across the country have to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. It is compulsory to wear one on public transport and in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, covering the nose and mouth, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown thatthe best materials to use,externalare tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands thoroughly or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth Avoid touching the mask, your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times Try not to keeping taking it off and putting it back on again, eg when going in and out of shops Store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them Wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent VIDEO: How to wear a face covering safely Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other guidance, such as social distancing and hand washing. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut-up sports socks. UK government: How to make a face covering,external Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly. When you have your mask, here are a few reminders of whatnotto do.

"Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has defended his plans for new post-Brexit border infrastructure after Labour said the government was unprepared. A Â£705m funding package to help manage Britain's borders has been announced as the UK prepares to leave the EU customs union at the end of the year. Mr Gove insisted the government had been ""laying the groundwork for months"". But Labour's Rachel Reeves said the plans were ""too little, too late."" The funding announcement follows a leaked letter from International Trade Secretary Liz Truss raising concerns about the readiness of Britain's ports. Under the plans, new border posts will be created inland where existing ports have no room to expand to cope with the extra checks that will be required. It relates only to the external borders of England, Scotland and Wales. Mr Gove told BBC's Andrew Marr programme that more details will be set out about the situation for Northern Ireland ""later this month"". A really simple guide to Brexit What are the sticking points in the trade talks? 'Injection of momentum' needed in Brexit talks The new funding will include up to Â£470m to build port and inland infrastructure, and Â£235m will be allocated for IT systems and staffing. The money for IT and staffing includes: Â£100m to develop HM Revenue and Customs systems to reduce the burden on traders Â£20m on new equipment Â£15m towards building new data infrastructure to improve border flow and management Â£10m to recruit around 500 more Border Force staff. Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said the funding would help the UK ""seize the opportunities"" post-Brexit. The UK left the EU on 31 January and is now in an 11-month transition period, during which existing trading rules and membership of the customs union and single market apply. What the UK's relationship with the EU will look like when the transition period ends will depend on whether a trade deal is reached. Northern Ireland will continue to follow some EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods even after the transition period. Customs checks on EU goodswill be delayed until July 2021. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations A leaked letter, firstreported by Business Insider,external, suggested Ms Truss had expressed concerns about the government's plans to phase in checks on EU goods coming into the UK after the Brexit transition period. Ms Truss reportedly warned fellow ministers that failing to impose full border controls until July could see increased smuggling from the EU, lead to legal challenges at the World Trade Organization, and even weaken the union with Northern Ireland. Post-Brexit checks on EU imports to be phased in What is the transition period? Mr Gove said: ""With or without further agreement with the EU, this Â£705m will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world's most effective and secure border."" Former national security adviser Lord Rickettsresponded on Twitter to Mr Gove's comments.,external""It's not clear to me how we will have 'the world's most effective and secure border' (Mr Gove) when we will lose access on 1 Jan to the Schengen Information System which gives alerts on movement of criminals/suspects,"" he said. He added that UK police and border staff consulted the shared Schengen system 600 million times last year. Former director general of UK Border Force Tony Smith said the funding was ""obviously welcome"" but ""a bit late in coming"". A Welsh Government spokesman said the plan showed the ""sheer complexity of the new bureaucracy"" which businesses face from 1 January and said it had been in discussions with the UK government as various sectors in Wales were affected. This video can not be played The customs union explained in 45 seconds Asked about reportsthe government had bought land in Kentto build a large lorry park as part of preparations for post-Brexit border checks, Mr Gove said: ""It is not our intention to create a massive concrete lorry park, it is the intention to provide the smart infrastructure which in Kent and elsewhere will allow the freight to flow."" Labour shadow minister Rachel Reeves said the measures were ""too little, too late"" and accused the government of being unprepared. And on the Brexit talks she said: ""We were promised an oven-ready deal but it looks like the government forgot to turn the oven on,"" referring to the Conservative Party's election slogan. The new Irish Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr that his country does not yet have all the information it needs about the Irish sea border arrangements. ""We do need more details, we need more precision,"" he said. ""I think we need an injection of momentum into the overall talks between the European Union and United Kingdom in relation to Brexit."" He said although he believes progress towards a trade deal has been slow, he added: ""I believe that if there's a will there's a way in terms of resolving outstanding issues."" ""I think there will be a deal, there has to be a deal,"" he said, but added: It can't be at any price."" Mr Gove said there had been ""movement"" in the negotiations but acknowledged that ""differences"" remained. Both sides agreed to ""intensify"" negotiations last month and held the first face-to-face talks since the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of July. The UK government has ruled out extending the transition period in order to reach a deal. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove also said the government will introduce a migration policy ""that ensures we're open to the world's best talent"". The governmentis planning a points-based immigration systemwhich treats EU migrants the same as those from the rest of the world and which takes different factors like skills and language into account when awarding visas allowing people to work in the UK. Mr Gove said: ""And the new technology we're introducing will allow us to monitor with far greater precision exactly who, and what, is coming in and out of the country, enabling us to deal more effectively with organised crime and other security threats."" More details about changes to the immigration system will be revealed on Monday. Writing in the Sun on Sunday,,externalHome Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We will scrap the bureaucratic Resident Labour Market Test, lower the skills and salary threshold and remove the cap on skilled workers."" The so-called ""resident labour market test"" only allows companies to recruit new workers from outside the EU if they are on the shortage list or if they have been unable to find anyone suitable after advertising in the UK. ""Our newHealth and Care Visawill ensure the NHS continues to benefit from the outstanding health and care professionals who have kept this country on its feet throughout the pandemic,"" Ms Patel added. And she said ""a new graduate route will ensure international students can stay in the country once they have completed their studies"".

The Scottish government is worried they won't - and so has told people they have to wear one in shops. On Friday, Boris Johnson appeared for the first time in public in a covering and hinted that stricter rules were coming in England. But now senior minister Michael Gove seems to be saying something different - that we should trust the common sense of shoppers. My sources are keen to point out Mr Gove also said the government would take more action when necessary - so mandatory face coverings in England aren't off the table. His comments are also in line with the policy as it stands just now. But at a time when public messaging is crucial, some believe the government view on whether or not stronger action is needed isn't clear. Â© 2025 BBC.

The Scottish government is worried they won't - and so has told people they have to wear one in shops. On Friday, Boris Johnson appeared for the first time in public in a covering and hinted that stricter rules were coming in England. But now senior minister Michael Gove seems to be saying something different - that we should trust the common sense of shoppers. My sources are keen to point out Mr Gove also said the government would take more action when necessary - so mandatory face coverings in England aren't off the table. His comments are also in line with the policy as it stands just now. But at a time when public messaging is crucial, some believe the government view on whether or not stronger action is needed isn't clear. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has defended his plans for new post-Brexit border infrastructure after Labour said the government was unprepared. A Â£705m funding package to help manage Britain's borders has been announced as the UK prepares to leave the EU customs union at the end of the year. Mr Gove insisted the government had been ""laying the groundwork for months"". But Labour's Rachel Reeves said the plans were ""too little, too late."" The funding announcement follows a leaked letter from International Trade Secretary Liz Truss raising concerns about the readiness of Britain's ports. Under the plans, new border posts will be created inland where existing ports have no room to expand to cope with the extra checks that will be required. It relates only to the external borders of England, Scotland and Wales. Mr Gove told BBC's Andrew Marr programme that more details will be set out about the situation for Northern Ireland ""later this month"". A really simple guide to Brexit What are the sticking points in the trade talks? 'Injection of momentum' needed in Brexit talks The new funding will include up to Â£470m to build port and inland infrastructure, and Â£235m will be allocated for IT systems and staffing. The money for IT and staffing includes: Â£100m to develop HM Revenue and Customs systems to reduce the burden on traders Â£20m on new equipment Â£15m towards building new data infrastructure to improve border flow and management Â£10m to recruit around 500 more Border Force staff. Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said the funding would help the UK ""seize the opportunities"" post-Brexit. The UK left the EU on 31 January and is now in an 11-month transition period, during which existing trading rules and membership of the customs union and single market apply. What the UK's relationship with the EU will look like when the transition period ends will depend on whether a trade deal is reached. Northern Ireland will continue to follow some EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods even after the transition period. Customs checks on EU goodswill be delayed until July 2021. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations A leaked letter, firstreported by Business Insider,external, suggested Ms Truss had expressed concerns about the government's plans to phase in checks on EU goods coming into the UK after the Brexit transition period. Ms Truss reportedly warned fellow ministers that failing to impose full border controls until July could see increased smuggling from the EU, lead to legal challenges at the World Trade Organization, and even weaken the union with Northern Ireland. Post-Brexit checks on EU imports to be phased in What is the transition period? Mr Gove said: ""With or without further agreement with the EU, this Â£705m will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world's most effective and secure border."" Former national security adviser Lord Rickettsresponded on Twitter to Mr Gove's comments.,external""It's not clear to me how we will have 'the world's most effective and secure border' (Mr Gove) when we will lose access on 1 Jan to the Schengen Information System which gives alerts on movement of criminals/suspects,"" he said. He added that UK police and border staff consulted the shared Schengen system 600 million times last year. Former director general of UK Border Force Tony Smith said the funding was ""obviously welcome"" but ""a bit late in coming"". A Welsh Government spokesman said the plan showed the ""sheer complexity of the new bureaucracy"" which businesses face from 1 January and said it had been in discussions with the UK government as various sectors in Wales were affected. This video can not be played The customs union explained in 45 seconds Asked about reportsthe government had bought land in Kentto build a large lorry park as part of preparations for post-Brexit border checks, Mr Gove said: ""It is not our intention to create a massive concrete lorry park, it is the intention to provide the smart infrastructure which in Kent and elsewhere will allow the freight to flow."" Labour shadow minister Rachel Reeves said the measures were ""too little, too late"" and accused the government of being unprepared. And on the Brexit talks she said: ""We were promised an oven-ready deal but it looks like the government forgot to turn the oven on,"" referring to the Conservative Party's election slogan. The new Irish Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr that his country does not yet have all the information it needs about the Irish sea border arrangements. ""We do need more details, we need more precision,"" he said. ""I think we need an injection of momentum into the overall talks between the European Union and United Kingdom in relation to Brexit."" He said although he believes progress towards a trade deal has been slow, he added: ""I believe that if there's a will there's a way in terms of resolving outstanding issues."" ""I think there will be a deal, there has to be a deal,"" he said, but added: It can't be at any price."" Mr Gove said there had been ""movement"" in the negotiations but acknowledged that ""differences"" remained. Both sides agreed to ""intensify"" negotiations last month and held the first face-to-face talks since the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of July. The UK government has ruled out extending the transition period in order to reach a deal. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove also said the government will introduce a migration policy ""that ensures we're open to the world's best talent"". The governmentis planning a points-based immigration systemwhich treats EU migrants the same as those from the rest of the world and which takes different factors like skills and language into account when awarding visas allowing people to work in the UK. Mr Gove said: ""And the new technology we're introducing will allow us to monitor with far greater precision exactly who, and what, is coming in and out of the country, enabling us to deal more effectively with organised crime and other security threats."" More details about changes to the immigration system will be revealed on Monday. Writing in the Sun on Sunday,,externalHome Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We will scrap the bureaucratic Resident Labour Market Test, lower the skills and salary threshold and remove the cap on skilled workers."" The so-called ""resident labour market test"" only allows companies to recruit new workers from outside the EU if they are on the shortage list or if they have been unable to find anyone suitable after advertising in the UK. ""Our newHealth and Care Visawill ensure the NHS continues to benefit from the outstanding health and care professionals who have kept this country on its feet throughout the pandemic,"" Ms Patel added.

An end to some restrictions is in sight -shielding is due to be paused at the end of July in Northern Ireland while social distancing has been reduced to 1m (3ft) with restrictions. But Dr Ian Banks and his three-year-old grandson LorcÃ¡n Maguire, both from County Down, will not benefit from these changes. They have always lived 2m apart. Dr Banks has not held LorcÃ¡n since his grandson was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) - a genetic condition that can cause fatal lung damage. In a cruel twist of fate, the former A&E doctor has a long-term lung infection that could be deadly to his grandson.

Khamenei has reportedly criticised âpeople who do not even do something as simple as wearing a maskâ, saying he was âashamedâ of this behaviour. His comments came as he urged citizens to help curb a resurgence of the virus. Iran has seen a second rise in
cases with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. A further 194 deaths and 2,186 cases were announced on Sunday. Khamenei called the resurgence âtruly tragicâ in a video conference on Sunday, AFP news agency reports. More than 12,600 people have died with Covid-19 in Iran since the outbreak began, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country warned on Saturday
that its economy could not afford another shutdown.

When news broke that 77-year-old Amitabh Bachchan had coronavirus, Indian TV channels began wall to wall coverage for a figure who is revered by billions. Doctors in Mumbai say Bachchan and his son Abhishek have mild symptoms and are stable in hospital. Abhishekâs wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, a former Miss World, has also tested positive along with the coupleâs eight-year-old daughter. Both are at home. The story has drawn attention to the wider challenges India faces. The country has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in the world - more than 850,000 people have been infected. Abhishek Bachchan, his wife Aishwarya Rai and their daughter Aaradhya have all tested positive for the virus The second Sunday of July would usually mean the men's singles final would be taking place at Wimbledon right about now.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Guidance on face coverings has evolved over the last few months. The key issue now is whether people will wear them without being forced to. The Scottish government is worried they won't - and so has told people they have to wear one in shops. On Friday, Boris Johnson appeared for the first time in public in a covering and hinted that stricter rules were coming in England. But now senior minister Michael Gove seems to be saying something different - that we should trust the common sense of shoppers. My sources are keen to point out Mr Gove also said the government would take more action when necessary - so mandatory face coverings in England aren't off the table. His comments are also in line with the policy as it stands just now. But at a time when public messaging is crucial, some believe the government view on whether or not stronger action is needed isn't clear. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The workers, who carry out picking and packing work, are being asked to remain on the farm during a period of isolation Up to 200 workers have been told to self-isolate on the farm where they pick crops after 73 of them tested positive for Covid-19. Vegetable producers A S Green and Co, in Herefordshire, has gone into lockdown after the positive tests. Food and other essential supplies are being delivered to the farm, where the workers have been segregated into the mobile homes they live in. The firm is also being supported by Public Health England (PHE). Herefordshire Council, which has organised the supply of deliveries, believes the outbreak is ""contained"" on the farm. The workers carry out picking and packing work during the harvesting season on the farm, just west of Malvern, in Worcestershire. The company said the welfare of its staff was its ""priority"" and further testing of management and visitors to the farm had so far produced negative test results. As a precaution, the workers are being treated as ""one extended bubble"" and are staying within household groups, the council said. Herefordshire Council said the workers are isolating in mobile homes on the site In a statement on its website, A S Green and Co said: ""Public Health England advises that it is very unlikely Covid-19 can be transmitted through food or food packaging, so shoppers can remain confident buying British fruit and veg."" The farm is currently closed to visitors. From 29 June to 5 July, Herefordshire had an average rate of two new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, figures from Public Health England show. This compares with Leicester, which had 116 cases per 100,000. Joan Cummins, BBC Midlands Today A S Green nestles in sight of the Malvern Hills in Herefordshire. The farm grows beans and broccoli and is a long established family run business in the area. It employs about 200 seasonal pickers and packers from Eastern Europe to help with the crop. A few workers could be seen in the distance wearing face coverings and walking to the entrance of the farm to collect shopping delivered by the local authority. I understand although a few of the workers had symptoms, most were asymptomatic and the positive results of 73 people came as a surprise to them. The Director of Public Health for Herefordshire said both the farm's owners and staff were co-operating with the health authorities. Katie Spence, PHE Midlands health protection director, said a range of infection control measures had been introduced, including on-site testing, social distancing in communal areas and the indoor packaging area. Workers are also being encouraged to wash their hands regularly and use face coverings in closed areas. ""Despite these measures, a small number of workers became symptomatic earlier this week and they and a few close contacts among the workforce were tested initially and found to be positive,"" she said. PHE said it is still awaiting a few final results of tests on the workforce. Hereford Council leader David Hitchiner said the virus is ""contained"" on the farm Karen Wright, director of public health for Herefordshire, said: ""Prompt testing on the farm has allowed us to understand transmission and control the spread of infection. ""We continue to support the farm management, their workers, who form an important part of our local economy, and the local community through this challenging time."" The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the industry takes this issue ""incredibly seriously"". ""Everything is being done to keep workers safe; their health and safety remains the priority,"" a spokesman said. ""Across the sector there have been significant investments this season; from the use of additional safety equipment and PPE, regularly testing temperatures, and following government guidance created specifically for seasonal workers."" Following the Pick for Britain campaign - an initiative to bring together UK workers and farmers to prevent crops rotting during the pandemic - the farm said it had received more than 300 applications. The farm's website says workers are expected to share accommodation at Rook Row Farm, while there is a recreational building with a pool table, dartboard and TV for all employees. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Why are there outbreaks in meat processing plants? Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry There has been a recent spike in cases atmeat processing plantsacross the UK and Europe. Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, said factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp are ""perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread"". The government hasissued guidelines,externalon working safely in food manufacturing. Overall, the Herefordshire council area has recorded 749 cases during lockdown, as of 7 July. Speaking to BBC Midlands Today, council leader David Hitchiner said: ""I would say we've got it contained, these people are not people who travel around the community, they tend to stay where they are. ""I don't physically know the site but I would hope it is quite isolated and so it shouldn't spread out among the community. ""The owners are keeping the workers there on the site and doing their very best to make sure it can't spread any further off this farm."" He added that expected PHE are now trying to trace the original source of the outbreak. EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has defended his plans for new post-Brexit border infrastructure after Labour said the government was unprepared. A Â£705m funding package to help manage Britain's borders has been announced as the UK prepares to leave the EU customs union at the end of the year. Mr Gove insisted the government had been ""laying the groundwork for months"". But Labour's Rachel Reeves said the plans were ""too little, too late."" The funding announcement follows a leaked letter from International Trade Secretary Liz Truss raising concerns about the readiness of Britain's ports. Under the plans, new border posts will be created inland where existing ports have no room to expand to cope with the extra checks that will be required. It relates only to the external borders of England, Scotland and Wales. Mr Gove told BBC's Andrew Marr programme that more details will be set out about the situation for Northern Ireland ""later this month"". A really simple guide to Brexit What are the sticking points in the trade talks? 'Injection of momentum' needed in Brexit talks The new funding will include up to Â£470m to build port and inland infrastructure, and Â£235m will be allocated for IT systems and staffing. The money for IT and staffing includes: Â£100m to develop HM Revenue and Customs systems to reduce the burden on traders Â£20m on new equipment Â£15m towards building new data infrastructure to improve border flow and management Â£10m to recruit around 500 more Border Force staff. Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said the funding would help the UK ""seize the opportunities"" post-Brexit. The UK left the EU on 31 January and is now in an 11-month transition period, during which existing trading rules and membership of the customs union and single market apply. What the UK's relationship with the EU will look like when the transition period ends will depend on whether a trade deal is reached. Northern Ireland will continue to follow some EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods even after the transition period. Customs checks on EU goodswill be delayed until July 2021. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake breaks down the next round of Brexit negotiations A leaked letter, firstreported by Business Insider,external, suggested Ms Truss had expressed concerns about the government's plans to phase in checks on EU goods coming into the UK after the Brexit transition period.

Post-Brexit checks on EU imports to be phased in What is the transition period? Mr Gove said: ""With or without further agreement with the EU, this Â£705m will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world's most effective and secure border."" Former national security adviser Lord Rickettsresponded on Twitter to Mr Gove's comments.,external""It's not clear to me how we will have 'the world's most effective and secure border' (Mr Gove) when we will lose access on 1 Jan to the Schengen Information System which gives alerts on movement of criminals/suspects,"" he said. He added that UK police and border staff consulted the shared Schengen system 600 million times last year. Former director general of UK Border Force Tony Smith said the funding was ""obviously welcome"" but ""a bit late in coming"". A Welsh Government spokesman said the plan showed the ""sheer complexity of the new bureaucracy"" which businesses face from 1 January and said it had been in discussions with the UK government as various sectors in Wales were affected.

Labour shadow minister Rachel Reeves said the measures were ""too little, too late"" and accused the government of being unprepared. And on the Brexit talks she said: ""We were promised an oven-ready deal but it looks like the government forgot to turn the oven on,"" referring to the Conservative Party's election slogan. The new Irish Taoiseach, MicheÃ¡l Martin, told the BBC's Andrew Marr that his country does not yet have all the information it needs about the Irish sea border arrangements. ""We do need more details, we need more precision,"" he said. ""I think we need an injection of momentum into the overall talks between the European Union and United Kingdom in relation to Brexit."" He said although he believes progress towards a trade deal has been slow, he added: ""I believe that if there's a will there's a way in terms of resolving outstanding issues."" ""I think there will be a deal, there has to be a deal,"" he said, but added: It can't be at any price."" Mr Gove said there had been ""movement"" in the negotiations but acknowledged that ""differences"" remained. Both sides agreed to ""intensify"" negotiations last month and held the first face-to-face talks since the coronavirus pandemic at the beginning of July. The UK government has ruled out extending the transition period in order to reach a deal. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMr Gove also said the government will introduce a migration policy ""that ensures we're open to the world's best talent"". The governmentis planning a points-based immigration systemwhich treats EU migrants the same as those from the rest of the world and which takes different factors like skills and language into account when awarding visas allowing people to work in the UK. Mr Gove said: ""And the new technology we're introducing will allow us to monitor with far greater precision exactly who, and what, is coming in and out of the country, enabling us to deal more effectively with organised crime and other security threats."" More details about changes to the immigration system will be revealed on Monday. Writing in the Sun on Sunday,,externalHome Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We will scrap the bureaucratic Resident Labour Market Test, lower the skills and salary threshold and remove the cap on skilled workers.""

Millions across the UK have also had to ""shield"" due to their high risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus. An end to some restrictions is in sight -shielding is due to be paused at the end of July in Northern Ireland while social distancing has been reduced to 1m (3ft) with restrictions. But Dr Ian Banks and his three-year-old grandson LorcÃ¡n Maguire, both from County Down, will not benefit from these changes. They have always lived 2m apart. Dr Banks has not held LorcÃ¡n since his grandson was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) - a genetic condition that can cause fatal lung damage. In a cruel twist of fate, the former A&E doctor has a long-term lung infection that could be deadly to his grandson.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Guidance on face coverings has evolved over the last few months. The key issue now is whether people will wear them without being forced to. The Scottish government is worried they won't - and so has told people they have to wear one in shops. On Friday, Boris Johnson appeared for the first time in public in a covering and hinted that stricter rules were coming in England. But now senior minister Michael Gove seems to be saying something different - that we should trust the common sense of shoppers. My sources are keen to point out Mr Gove also said the government would take more action when necessary - so mandatory face coverings in England aren't off the table. His comments are also in line with the policy as it stands just now. But at a time when public messaging is crucial, some believe the government view on whether or not stronger action is needed isn't clear. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Cabinet Minister Michael Gove has defended his plans for new post-Brexit border infrastructure after Labour said the government was unprepared.

The funding announcement follows a leaked letter from International Trade Secretary Liz Truss raising concerns about the readiness of Britain's ports. Under the plans, new border posts will be created inland where existing ports have no room to expand to cope with the extra checks that will be required.

"The Short Stirling Bomber BK716 was lost when returning from a bombing raid in Germany Plans that could see an RAF World War Two bomber lifted from a lake in the Netherlands by a crane grabber rather than using a dam have been criticised. The Short Stirling Bomber, based at RAF Downham Market in Norfolk, was lost returning from a 1943 raid on Germany. Plane enthusiast Rick Brooks has voiced anger Dutch authorities could use a crane he likened to an arcade ""machine where you grab a teddy"" to lift it. Almere city council said it had not yet announced the recovery method. The aircraft BK716 was found earlier this year submerged in Lake Markermeer, near Amsterdam, and it is thought the remains of the crew would still be on board. Mr Brooks, who has been involved in previous operations to recover aircraft, said in the past when wartime aircraft were recovered from rivers or a lakes a cofferdam was used so the site could be properly excavated and the remains of the crew could be carefully retrieved with any items found near their remains. A cofferdam allows water to be pumped out, creating a dry area for land reclamation work to proceed. This is the type of plane flown by the crew The crew of Short Stirling BK716 were: Sgt Charles Armstrong Bell, 29, from Langley Park, County Durham Pilot Officer John Michael Campbell, 30, from Golders Green, north London Flying Officer Harry Gregory Farrington, 24, from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada Flying Officer John Frederick Harris, 29, from Swindon, Wiltshire Sgt Ronald Kennedy, 22, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne Sgt John Francis James McCaw, 20, from Belleville, Ontario, Canada Sgt Leonard Richard James Shrubsall, 30, from Iwade, Kent But Mr Brooks, who has been in contact with teams involved in recovery operations in the Netherlands, said he believed Almere council had been looking at the cheaper method he compared to an amusement arcade machine. Mr Brooks, who lives in Ashford, Kent, said to respect the memory of the seven man crew the bomber should be properly excavated. He said through the use of cofferdams, teams have had ""success in finding those small items that mean so much to the airmen's surviving relatives"". Mr Brooks said a grabber would be ""destructive"" and would leave behind body parts and ""small items like a wedding ring or a watch"" that he said could help identify the remains. Almere council said it had ""decided to respect the wishes of relatives to salvage the aircraft, and to honour the killed crew members"". ""Care and respect are first priority, both towards relatives and in the method of recovery as decided by the (Dutch) Ministry of Defence,"" it said. ""We will soon announce the chosen method of recovery and the start date of the recovery process."" Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.
