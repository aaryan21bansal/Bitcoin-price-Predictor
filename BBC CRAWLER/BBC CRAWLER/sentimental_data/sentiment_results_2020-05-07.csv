"Major credit card companies should block payments to pornographic sites, according to a group of international campaigners and campaign groups who say they work to tackle sexual exploitation. A letter seen by the BBC, signed by more than 10 campaigners and campaign groups, says porn sites ""eroticise sexual violence, incest, and racism"" and stream content that features child sexual abuse and sex trafficking. One leading site, Pornhub, said ""the letter [was] not only factually wrong but also intentionally misleading."" Mastercard told the BBC they were investigating claims made in the letter on pornography sites and would ""terminate their connection to our network"" if illegal activity by a cardholder was confirmed. The letter was sent to 10 major credit card companies, including the ""Big Three"", Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The signatories from countries including the UK, US, India, Uganda and Australia have called for the immediate suspension of payments to pornographic sites. The signatories of the letter include the anti-pornography non-profit group the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) in the US, and other faith-led or women and child rights' advocacy groups. The letter alleges it is impossible to ""judge or verify consent in any videos on their site, let alone live webcam videos"" which ""inherently makes pornography websites a target for sex traffickers, child abusers, and others sharing predatory nonconsensual videos"". ""We've been seeing an increasingly global outcry about the harms of pornography sharing websites in a number of ways in recent months,"" said Haley McNamara, the director of the UK-based International Centre on Sexual Exploitation, the international arm of the NCOSE and a signatory of the letter. ""We in the international child advocacy and anti-sexual exploitation community are demanding financial institutions to critically analyse their supportive role in the pornography industry, and to cut ties with them,"" she told the BBC. A report on the appetite for child abuse videos on pornography sites was published in April by India Child Protection Fund (ICPF). The organisation said there had been a steep increase in demand for child abuse searches on pornography sites in India, particularly since coronavirus lockdown. Pornhub, the most popular pornography streaming site, is named in the letter. In 2019, it registered more than 42 billion visits, the equivalent of 115 million a day. Pornhub was under scrutiny last year when one of its content providers - Girls Do Porn - became the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI charged four people working for the production company that created the channel of coaxing women into making pornographic films under false pretences. Pornhub removed the Girls Do Porn channel as soon as the charges were made. Commenting to the BBC in February regarding this case, Pornhub said its policy was to ""remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case"". In October last year a 30-year-old Florida man, Christopher Johnson, faced charges for sexually abusing a 15 year old. Videos of the alleged attack had been posted on Pornhub. In the same statement to the BBC in February, Pornhub said its policy was to ""remove unauthorised content as soon as we are made aware of it, which is exactly what we did in this case"". The Internet Watch Foundation, a UK organisation that specialises in monitoring online sexual abuse - particularly of children - confirmed to the BBC that they had found 118 instances of child sexual abuse and child rape videos on Pornhub between 2017 and 2019. The body works in partnership with global police and governments to flag illegal content. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Pornhub said they had ""a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting any and all illegal content, including non-consensual and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate."" ""Our content moderation system is at the forefront of the industry, utilising leading technologies and moderation techniques that create a comprehensive process to detect and rid the platform of any illegal content. Pornhub said the letter was sent by organisations ""who attempt to police people's sexual orientation and activity - are not only factually wrong but also intentionally misleading."" American Express has had a global policy in place since 2000 that says it prohibits transactions for adult digital content where the risk is deemed unusually high, with a total ban on online pornography.  In an interview with the Smartmoney website in 2011, a spokesperson for American Express at the time said this was due to high levels of disputes, and an additional safeguard in the fight against child pornography. Yet, the organisations also sent the letters to American Express, because they say American Express payment options have been offered on pornography sites - including one that specialises in teenage themed content. A spokesperson for American Express told the BBC that while the global policy still stood, American Express had a pilot with one company that allowed for payment to certain pornography streaming websites if the payment was made within the US and on a US consumer credit card. Other major credit card companies, including Visa and MasterCard, do allow both credit and debit card holders to purchase online pornography. In an email to the BBC, a spokesperson for Mastercard said they were ""currently investigating the claims referred to us in the letter. ""The way our network works is that a bank connects a merchant to our network to accept card payments. ""If we confirm illegal activity or violations of our rules (by card holders), we will work with the merchant's bank to either bring them into compliance or to terminate their connection to our network. ""This is consistent with how we have previously worked with law enforcement agencies and groups like National and International Centers for Missing and Exploited Children."" Some moves have been made by online payment companies to distance themselves from the pornography industry. In November 2019, Paypal, the global online payment company, announced it would no longer be supporting payments to Pornhub as their policy forbids supporting ""certain sexually oriented materials or services"". In a blog on their site, Pornhub said they were ""devastated"" by the decision and the move would leave thousands of Pornhub models and performers who relied on subscription from the premium services without payment. A pornography performer who shares material on Pornhub, and who asked to remain anonymous, said a payment freeze would have devastating implications for her earnings. ""Honestly, it would be a body blow,"" she said. ""It would wipe out my entire income and I wouldn't know how to earn money, especially now in lockdown."" Following mounting pressure for more accountability from pornographic sites, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska sent a letter to the US Department of Justice in March asking Attorney General William Barr to investigate Pornhub for allegedly streaming acts of rape and exploitation. In the same month, nine Canadian multi-party parliamentarians wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling for an investigation into MindGeek, the parent company of Pornhub which has its headquarters in Montreal.

"The masks were destined for the NHS and care home staff Thieves have stolen 80,000 face masks which were destined for the NHS and front-line workers. The Â£166,000 worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) was taken when three people broke into a warehouse in Salford on Wednesday. Det Insp Chris Mannion, from Greater Manchester Police, said it was a ""particularly sickening crime"". The masks were to be supplied to the NHS, along with councils and care homes, in West Yorkshire. Det Insp Chris Mannion said the thefts were shocking The high-quality n95 respirator masks were taken from the warehouse of a medical supplies firm at the Trafalgar Business Park overnight. The gang spent about two hours at the premises, first cutting a hole in the warehouse steel shutters so as not to trigger burglar alarms by lifting up the door. They then removed 320 boxes, or 10 pallets' worth, of the masks. Other medical equipment, including cheaper quality masks also housed at the site, were left untouched. Police want to trace three offenders - two men and a third person, possibly a woman, who were all wearing dark clothing - who made off with the haul in three vehicles, a white Mercedes Sprinter van, a grey Volkswagen Caddy van and a grey silver estate vehicle. Detectives believe they were at the site between 21:30 BST on Wednesday and 00:20 on Thursday, when the alarm was raised by a security guard. ""It is shocking there are people prepared to steal the equipment which protects vulnerable people and front-line workers,"" Det Insp Mannion said. ""This is a particularly sickening crime when you consider that the PPE was intended for the NHS and for care home workers and at a time when we are trying to protect the NHS and one another against one common enemy in Covid-19. ""Clearly there's an open market there and there's any number of ways that these people can sell on the goods stolen from here."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' A further 3.2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic continued to mount. The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 33.3 million- or about 20% of the US workforce. The number of new claims reported each week by the Department of Labor has subsided since hitting a peak of 6.9 million in March. But they remain extraordinarily high. And the number of people collecting benefits has continued to rise, despite recent moves to start re-opening in some parts of the country. ""The significant rise in continuing claims ... is a little disappointing since it suggests few people are being recalled to work,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. Companies such as Uber, Lyft and Airbnb are amongst the firms that have announced cuts in recent weeks, as shutdowns halted significant amounts of travel. The impact has been felt across the economy, affecting medical practices, restaurants and administrative workers among many others. Economists say the monthly unemployment rate for April, which will be released on Friday, is likely to reach 15% or higher. Just two months ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.5%, a 50-year low. Since the coronavirus has taken hold in the US, the country has suffered its worst growth numbers in a decade, the worst retail sales report on record and declines in business activity not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, weeks of elevated unemployment claims have far surpassed the prior record of 700,000. Food pantries have seen spikes in demand, and homeowners and renters have delayed monthly payments. The National Multifamily Housing Council - an industry group for apartment owners - reported last month that nearly a third of renters did not make their full payment by the first of the month. ""If nothing else changes and evictions continue as normal, this public health crisis will turn into a full blown homelessness crisis,"" said Matthew Desmond, a sociology professor at Princeton University who runs the Eviction Lab project. All of my business has been cancelled - I've had no work since February. I'm a corporate photographer, and businesses aren't doing corporate events right now, and school graduations have been delayed. I've had about 15 jobs cancelled. My work normally happens in the spring and fall - a lot of corporations don't have events over the summer, so I only have about seven months to make my income. I have some events scheduled for October, but it's not clear whether they're going to go ahead. I haven't gotten my stimulus cheque yet - I don't know why. I had applied for unemployment, but was told I didn't qualify - it's complicated because I'm an employee of my own company, but don't pay myself until mid-year or the end of the year. Fortunately my partner works. I do miss my work - I'm very blessed I was able to do what I enjoy and make a good living out of it. It takes a lot of perseverance, and I miss going out and talking to people. Stories of fear, unemployment and hope Reporting by Helier Cheung Economists are hoping the pain will ease as businesses gradually restart. Retailers such as Gap have already announced plans for re-opening some stores. Others, including J Crew and department store Neiman Marcus, have been pushed into bankruptcy. Moody's Investors Service has predicted that the unemployment rate could fall back to 7% by the end of the year, but that forecast depends on the virus. The longer the shutdown persists, the harder it will be for the economy to rebound. ""If the US does not contain the pandemic and the economy remains shut beyond the second quarter, the unemployment rate would rise further ... and many of the job losses that we currently view as temporary would likely become permanent,"" the firm's analysts said.

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

Starting on Friday, retail businesses will allow kerbside pickups. Manufacturing will also resume, provided that employees wear masks and stay six feet (two metres) apart. Businesses where staff and customers come into close contact - such as hair salons - have not yet been given the green light to open. Earlier this week, California became the first state to formally request a loan from the federal government to help with swelling jobless claims.

You can read more about the latest US figureshere. Up to 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 during
the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again. Willinger brewery in Hesse offered the beer to locals on Thursday. Dozens of people queued up while observing social distancing rules. Many took full buckets and boxes home with them. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that breweries across the country are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports. Bavaria's Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, has been cancelled. Shelley Luther refused to close her beauty salon The governor of Texas has amended his lockdown executive order to free a salon owner who was jailed after refusing to close down her business. Gov Greg Abbott's order bans ""confinement as a punishment"" for violating virus mitigation orders. Shelley Luther, the owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, was jailed for contempt of court on Tuesday after she refused to apologise and pay a fine for staying open despite official warnings.

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say it was a ""brilliant show of support again for our heroic carers and all those on the front line"".

Earlier today, Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that a member of the US military who works at the White House had tested positive.

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"".

daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour.

England's Billy Vunipola, Alex Goode and Nick Isiekwe, Scotland back Sean Maitland and prop Josh Ibuanokpe were reportedly spotted in St Albans. The Daily Mail said the players met for a coffee and a chat in the street and did not follow social distancing rules. The Premiership season is currently suspended because of the pandemic. ""Management has spoken to the players involved, all of whom accept that they made an error in judgement,"" said a Saracens statement.

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers.

"The NHS is running an awareness campaign to promote the app The NHS has released the source code behind its coronavirus contact-tracing app. More than 40,000 people have installed the smartphone software so far. The health service is targeting the Isle of Wight only, at this stage, but it says this is the first stage of the app's rollout - not a test. Tests carried out on behalf of BBC News confirm the developers have found a way to work round restrictions Apple places on the use of Bluetooth in iPhones. In a related development, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced that Baroness Dido Harding will head up the wider test, track and trace programme. The appointment has surprised some given that when she was chief executive of TalkTalk, the internet provider suffered a major data breach and failed to properly notify affected customers. The NHS Covid-19 app is designed to use people's smartphones to keep track of when they come close to each other and for how long, by sending wireless Bluetooth signals. About a third of over-16s living on the Isle of Wight have downloaded the NHS Covid-19 app so far If one of them falls ill, they can anonymously trigger an upload of the records so alerts can be cascaded to others they might have infected, asking them to self-isolate, if deemed necessary,  potentially before they have any symptoms but are still highly contagious. Along with other measures, including manual contact tracing, this may allow lockdown measures to be eased without causing another spike in cases. NHSX, the health service's digital innovation unit, has opted for a centralised system to power the app, so the contact-matching process happens on a UK-based computer server rather than individuals' smartphones. And there has been a lot of speculation this decision would mean the app was doomed to work badly on iPhones. Apple limits the extent to which third-party apps can use Bluetooth when they are off-screen and running in the background, although it has promised to relax this rule for contact-tracing apps that use a decentralised system it is co-developing with Google. And Singapore and Australiahave signalled they will switch from centralised to decentralised apps, for that reason. But NHSX had said it had come up with its own solution. And preliminary tests by a cyber-security company suggest it has succeeded. Pen Test Partners installed the app on a handful of ""jailbroken"" iPhones - altered to allow them to monitor activity normally hidden from users. A cyber-security team analysed when Bluetooth ""handshakes"" were made between the devices it tested ""When first placed in proximity to each other, the phones would start to 'beacon' over Bluetooth at either eight- or 16-second intervals,"" co-founder Ken Munro said. ""Others had expressed concern about the app not being effective when 'backgrounded'. ""Our tests showed that this did not appear to affect the beaconing, whether the phones had encountered each other for the first time or subsequently been physically moved out and then back into range."" A second company, Reincubate, found the app would sometimes ""go quiet"" when run undisturbed in the background for more than 90 minutes but suggested this should not be too big an issue in real-world conditions. ""A number of reasonable factors can trigger this window being extended, including other use of Bluetooth, the presence of Android devices and the effectiveness of notifications [asking the user to reopen the app],""it blogged,external. ""In our tests, the iOS devices we've run the app on have continued to keep the background service running overnight."" There will be further scrutiny of the app nowthe source code has been published to Github,external, allowing others to see how the workarounds were achieved. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this week, the Joint Human Rights Committee heard evidence that despite the app anonymising users' identities, they could in theory be re-identified, which might allow the authorities - or even hackers - to reveal people's social circles for other purposes. And the committee said a new watchdog should be created to oversee use of the app and the measures taken to keep the data safe. World split between two types of app Hands on with NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app Why are there doubts over contact-tracing apps? Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee, said: ""Assurances from ministers about privacy are not enough. ""There must be robust legal protection for individuals about what that data will be used for, who will have access to it, and how it will be safeguarded from hacking."" Critics say a decentralised approach - where contact-matching happens on handsets - would better protect users' privacy. And BBC News has been told members of an ethics group advising NHSX on the app are calling for it to better explain the advantages of a centralised system. Oxford University's Prof Christophe Fraser has been advising NHSX and other health authorities on their contact-tracing apps Prof Christophe Fraser- an epidemiologist advising NHSX - told BBC News the two main benefits were: it made it possible to ask people to self-diagnose rather than wait for test results, because any mass attempt to abuse the process could be detected the collected data could be used to fine-tune the system to deliver different kinds of alerts depending on the risk scores calculated But he added talks were continuing with Apple and Google. And analysis of how the app was being used in the Isle of Wight would inform decisions on how best to proceed. ""There's been a lot of discussion of privacy, and rightly so,"" he said. ""But there is also your ability to save lives. ""And there is the ability not to be quarantining millions of people. ""Figuring out how we can find the optimal system that trades off these different requirements is a bit of an open question at this stage.""

"A student who gathered 330,000 signatures calling for a refund of university tuition fees says students are being ""completely ignored"". Sophie Quinn's petition calls for a refund for teaching lost in the Covid-19 outbreak and lecturers' strikes. Her claim was brought before the House of Commons Petitions Committee. Universities UK told MPs universities were under ""severe financial pressure"" and paying refunds to students could ""put some institutions at risk"". ""Universities are doing all they can to make sure that students achieve the learning outcomes they need,"" president Julia Buckingham said. Ms Quinn told an online session of the committee students were feeling ""angry and let down"" and had not got what they paid for. ""This whole year has been disrupted by strikes and the coronavirus,"" the University of Liverpool student told the committee. She told MPs students were ""frustrated"" by: the variable quality of lessons taught online no access to campus facilities lack of contact with staff paying rent on accommodation they were not using ""As students we feel we have been completely ignored,"" she said, calling for a full or partial reimbursement of the tuition fees paid by students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ms Quinn said it remained unclear how the fees, which are for university services as well as teaching, were being spent this year. Online students would still face full tuition fees next term Students angry at having to pay rent on empty rooms Universities warn of going bust without emergency funds University admissions could face student number controls Prof Buckingham said if students had concerns over fees they should pursue complaints through the processes of their universities and then through the independent adjudicator. But Ms Quinn said as all students were disrupted by the Covid-19 outbreak it did not seem ""efficient"" or a good use of university resources for every student to put in a separate grievance claim.

UCU lecturers' union leader Jo Grady said the petition showed students were not happy with ""exorbitant fees"" and were not ""getting what they were told to expect"", while many academic staff on insecure contracts were also vulnerable. She called for greater clarity on how campuses were meant to safely reopen in the autumn - and said there were discussions about students from some subjects going back in person while others would be taught online. National Union of Students president Zamzam Ibrahim said students could be getting different levels of quality in their online lessons. ""There is no clear guidance of what adequate teaching looks like,"" she said.

"We have gone weeks without seeing friends and family, without school, holidays or even being able to go to work. On 10 May, Boris Johnson is expected to address lockdown measures, although people should ""not expect big changes."" So what can be lifted and when? This virus remains massively contagious. Before lockdown, one infected person passed it onto at least three others on average (the so called R-number). And less than 5% of the UK population is estimated to have been infected. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The goal of lockdown has been to cut infections by around 70% to force the R-number below one (the point at which the outbreak starts to decline). That has been achieved. However, it is only just below one. ""There isn't much wiggle room,"" a source within the government's science advisers told me, adding the country ""can't make a huge number of changes"". One set of modelling suggests opening schools - and nothing else - would be enough to almost tip us back into rising cases. The aim is to create more ""wiggle room"" - you identify cases and then perform rapid contact tracing and put those at risk in quarantine. This strategy, also called ""seek and destroy"", will be supported by a voluntary smartphone app which will help identify contacts. The more successfully this is done, the more it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and the more restrictions can be lifted on day-to-day life. ""At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,"" said Dr Kucharski. ""If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with."" But even this is not life as normal and other measures would still be needed to keep the disease in check. ""It is a more moderate version of where we are now,"" said Dr Kucharski. When will the outbreak end and life get back to normal? How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? Another strategy proposed by some is ""enhanced shielding"". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society, you could instead aim to stop it completely forthe most vulnerable. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. ""If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently."" That would mean all staff hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting those deemed vulnerable being regularly tested to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally, antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could put those ""shields"" under intense pressure. Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus. Some restrictions are less risky in terms of spreading the virus. ""Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options - it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. Dr Kucharski argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories: Those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Wales has already announced that from 11 May, people will be able able to exercise more than once a day. Moderate risk would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. ""I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,"" he says. There remains a nervousness within the scientific advice to government about lifting restrictions in areas, like pubs, whose whole purpose is to bring people together. And there is an emerging question around primary schools as young children, some studies suggest, cannot be infected as easily. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? R-NUMBER:Is this the crucial number? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? There is a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus now we've passed the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible. That will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave and make testing and contact tracing more likely to be effective. The trade-off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown now and accept having a higher number of cases, which creates its own problems. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine, as immunising people would mean there was no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. Failing that, the concept of herd immunity may kick in when around 70% of the population have been infected and the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference if they could stop Covid-19 progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. Download theBBC News Appfor all the latest headlines.

About one million people usually attend the event in west London, which was due to take place on 30 and 31 August. Organisers said the pandemic meant that calling off the weekend was ""the only safe option"", but said they were working on holding a celebration on the same weekend in an alternative form. It is the first time it will not take placein more than 50 years. The carnival, which has been held since 1966, is the latest in a string of summer calendar events to have been postponed, including theGlastonbury Festivaland theTokyo Olympics. The event normally attracts more than one million people to the streets of west London Carnival organisers said the decision followed ""lengthy consultations with our strategic partners and our Advisory Council"". ""This has not been an easy decision to make, but the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic and the way in which it has unfolded means that this is the only safe option,"" they said.

"Passengers travelling through some UK airports are being told to cover their faces and wear gloves due to Covid-19. The new rules will apply to those travelling through Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports from Thursday. Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which owns the sites, said the measure will show ""one way in which air travel can be made safe"". The announcement comes as the aviation sector struggles with coronavirus. The three airports are believed to be the first in the UK to introduce such strict hygiene rules. Heathrow trialling passenger temperature checks Air fares face turbulence when flights slowly restart Those passing through the airport will be given face coverings or masks as well as gloves during the initial stages of the trial. All airport staff serving passengers will also be required to wear the items. MAG boss Charlie Cornish said: ""It's clear that social distancing will not work on any form of public transport. But we're confident that when the time is right, people will be able to travel safely. We now need to work urgently with government to agree how we operate in the future."" He added: ""This has to be a top priority so that people can be confident about flying, and to get tourism and travel going again."" Temperature screening trials will also be conducted at Stansted over the next few weeks to test equipment. It follows the boss of Heathrow airport confirming on Wednesday that it is trialling large-scale temperature checks. Chief executive John Holland-Kaye said they are already being carried out at departure gates on people going to places where this is a requirement. He also urged the government to produce a plan on what common standards UK airports should adopt, so that the aviation sector could ""get started again"". Many airlines have been struggling as the coronavirus pandemic has brought global travel to a virtual standstill. On Thursday, British Airways owner IAG has said it is hoping for a ""meaningful return"" of flights in July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed. However, IAG - which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus - said these plans were ""highly uncertain"", and were subject to various travel restrictions. IAG said it did not expect passenger demand, which has been hit by the pandemic, to recover before 2023. ""We will adapt our operating procedures to ensure our customers and our people are properly protected in this new environment,"" chief executive Willie Walsh said. The group said that even if flights resumed in the summer it expected that passenger capacity would still only be half the usual level in 2020. Since late March, capacity has fallen by 94%, with most of the group's aircraft grounded. The announcement came as IAG reported losses after tax hit  â¬1.68bn (Â£1.47bn) during the first three months of the year, which  included a â¬1.3bn charge for fuel hedges. Many airlines are struggling during the pandemic IAG also reported an operating loss of â¬535m (Â£466.6m) for the quarter, down from a â¬135m profit in 2019. The group added that it expected the second quarter to be ""significantly worse"". In an attempt to shore up cash during the coronavirus crisis, IAG said that it expected to defer deliveries of 68 aircraft. Although IAG is planning for a resumption of some services, it says it will still need to let go of many staff. Last month, BA said it was set to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 42,000-strong workforce. It also told staff thatits Gatwick airport operation might not reopenafter the pandemic passes. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh will delay his retirement until September IAG chief executive Willie Walsh had been due to retire in March, but will stay on until September ""to focus on the immediate response to the crisis"". Luis Gallego, head of the group's Spanish division, Iberia, since 2014, will succeed him. On Wednesday, other aviation bosses called for additional support for the sector from the UK government. Speaking to MPs on the Transport Select Committee, Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye argued that the French, German and US governments had provided large, bespoke rescue packages for their aviation industries as they saw them as ""fundamental"", and suggested that was not the case in the UK. Air France KLM, for example, won a â¬7bn loan package from the French government in April. However, IAG's competitor has reported that it made a loss in its day-to-day business of â¬815m in the three months of the year due to travel grinding to a halt. Several other firms posted trading updates on Thursday which detailed how they had been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. H&M, the world's second-largest fashion retailer, said sales had plunged by 57% in the last two months, with sales ""muted"" in stores that had been allowed to reopen. InterContinental Hotels Group,the owner of Holiday Inn, warned that occupancy levels dropped to ""historic lows"" in March and April. BTannounced it would not pay a dividend to shareholders until 2022. Ticketing app Trainlinesaid that UK and European passenger volumes were down by as much as 95% in the first quarter.

"A student who gathered 330,000 signatures calling for a refund of university tuition fees says students are being ""completely ignored"". Sophie Quinn's petition calls for a refund for teaching lost in the Covid-19 outbreak and lecturers' strikes. Her claim was brought before the House of Commons Petitions Committee. Universities UK told MPs universities were under ""severe financial pressure"" and paying refunds to students could ""put some institutions at risk"". ""Universities are doing all they can to make sure that students achieve the learning outcomes they need,"" president Julia Buckingham said. Ms Quinn told an online session of the committee students were feeling ""angry and let down"" and had not got what they paid for. ""This whole year has been disrupted by strikes and the coronavirus,"" the University of Liverpool student told the committee. She told MPs students were ""frustrated"" by: the variable quality of lessons taught online no access to campus facilities lack of contact with staff paying rent on accommodation they were not using ""As students we feel we have been completely ignored,"" she said, calling for a full or partial reimbursement of the tuition fees paid by students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ms Quinn said it remained unclear how the fees, which are for university services as well as teaching, were being spent this year. Online students would still face full tuition fees next term Students angry at having to pay rent on empty rooms Universities warn of going bust without emergency funds University admissions could face student number controls Prof Buckingham said if students had concerns over fees they should pursue complaints through the processes of their universities and then through the independent adjudicator. But Ms Quinn said as all students were disrupted by the Covid-19 outbreak it did not seem ""efficient"" or a good use of university resources for every student to put in a separate grievance claim.

UCU lecturers' union leader Jo Grady said the petition showed students were not happy with ""exorbitant fees"" and were not ""getting what they were told to expect"", while many academic staff on insecure contracts were also vulnerable. She called for greater clarity on how campuses were meant to safely reopen in the autumn - and said there were discussions about students from some subjects going back in person while others would be taught online. National Union of Students president Zamzam Ibrahim said students could be getting different levels of quality in their online lessons. ""There is no clear guidance of what adequate teaching looks like,"" she said. Earlier this week, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said students would still have to pay full tuition fees if universities were teaching online in the autumn term - as long as the quality was good enough.

"The NHS is running an awareness campaign to promote the app The NHS has released the source code behind its coronavirus contact-tracing app. More than 40,000 people have installed the smartphone software so far. The health service is targeting the Isle of Wight only, at this stage, but it says this is the first stage of the app's rollout - not a test. Tests carried out on behalf of BBC News confirm the developers have found a way to work round restrictions Apple places on the use of Bluetooth in iPhones. In a related development, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced that Baroness Dido Harding will head up the wider test, track and trace programme. The appointment has surprised some given that when she was chief executive of TalkTalk, the internet provider suffered a major data breach and failed to properly notify affected customers. The NHS Covid-19 app is designed to use people's smartphones to keep track of when they come close to each other and for how long, by sending wireless Bluetooth signals. About a third of over-16s living on the Isle of Wight have downloaded the NHS Covid-19 app so far If one of them falls ill, they can anonymously trigger an upload of the records so alerts can be cascaded to others they might have infected, asking them to self-isolate, if deemed necessary,  potentially before they have any symptoms but are still highly contagious. Along with other measures, including manual contact tracing, this may allow lockdown measures to be eased without causing another spike in cases. NHSX, the health service's digital innovation unit, has opted for a centralised system to power the app, so the contact-matching process happens on a UK-based computer server rather than individuals' smartphones. And there has been a lot of speculation this decision would mean the app was doomed to work badly on iPhones. Apple limits the extent to which third-party apps can use Bluetooth when they are off-screen and running in the background, although it has promised to relax this rule for contact-tracing apps that use a decentralised system it is co-developing with Google. And Singapore and Australiahave signalled they will switch from centralised to decentralised apps, for that reason. But NHSX had said it had come up with its own solution. And preliminary tests by a cyber-security company suggest it has succeeded. Pen Test Partners installed the app on a handful of ""jailbroken"" iPhones - altered to allow them to monitor activity normally hidden from users. A cyber-security team analysed when Bluetooth ""handshakes"" were made between the devices it tested ""When first placed in proximity to each other, the phones would start to 'beacon' over Bluetooth at either eight- or 16-second intervals,"" co-founder Ken Munro said. ""Others had expressed concern about the app not being effective when 'backgrounded'. ""Our tests showed that this did not appear to affect the beaconing, whether the phones had encountered each other for the first time or subsequently been physically moved out and then back into range."" A second company, Reincubate, found the app would sometimes ""go quiet"" when run undisturbed in the background for more than 90 minutes but suggested this should not be too big an issue in real-world conditions. ""A number of reasonable factors can trigger this window being extended, including other use of Bluetooth, the presence of Android devices and the effectiveness of notifications [asking the user to reopen the app],""it blogged,external. ""In our tests, the iOS devices we've run the app on have continued to keep the background service running overnight."" There will be further scrutiny of the app nowthe source code has been published to Github,external, allowing others to see how the workarounds were achieved. Allow Twitter content?

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Earlier this week, the Joint Human Rights Committee heard evidence that despite the app anonymising users' identities, they could in theory be re-identified, which might allow the authorities - or even hackers - to reveal people's social circles for other purposes. And the committee said a new watchdog should be created to oversee use of the app and the measures taken to keep the data safe. World split between two types of app Hands on with NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app Why are there doubts over contact-tracing apps? Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee, said: ""Assurances from ministers about privacy are not enough. ""There must be robust legal protection for individuals about what that data will be used for, who will have access to it, and how it will be safeguarded from hacking."" Critics say a decentralised approach - where contact-matching happens on handsets - would better protect users' privacy. And BBC News has been told members of an ethics group advising NHSX on the app are calling for it to better explain the advantages of a centralised system. Oxford University's Prof Christophe Fraser has been advising NHSX and other health authorities on their contact-tracing apps Prof Christophe Fraser- an epidemiologist advising NHSX - told BBC News the two main benefits were: it made it possible to ask people to self-diagnose rather than wait for test results, because any mass attempt to abuse the process could be detected the collected data could be used to fine-tune the system to deliver different kinds of alerts depending on the risk scores calculated But he added talks were continuing with Apple and Google. And analysis of how the app was being used in the Isle of Wight would inform decisions on how best to proceed. ""There's been a lot of discussion of privacy, and rightly so,"" he said. ""But there is also your ability to save lives. ""And there is the ability not to be quarantining millions of people. ""Figuring out how we can find the optimal system that trades off these different requirements is a bit of an open question at this stage.""

"Dame Vera Lynn was known as the Forces' Sweetheart during her World War Two heyday Dame Vera Lynn has spoken about the bravery and sacrifice that characterises the nation on the eve of the 75th anniversary of VE Day. In 1945, huge crowds celebrated after learning of the final surrender of the Nazis, but many will spend Friday's anniversary in coronavirus lockdown. Dame Vera,now 103, said while people would be apart, ""hope remains even in the most difficult of times"". Quoting from her most well-known song, she said: ""We will meet again."" The wartime song was also echoed by the Queen in a special televised addressin April, when she acknowledged the hardship Britons were facing during the Covid-19 crisis. The statement by Dame Vera, who lives in Ditchling, East Sussex, said VE Day was one of the most important days in the UK's history, marking the day when freedom returned ""after the most difficult of times"". She said as celebrations were held for the anniversary ""we must all remember the brave boys and what they sacrificed for us... they left their families and homes to fight for our freedom and many lost their lives trying to protect us and our liberties"". How is VE Day being celebrated this year? One of Vera Lynn's most famous songs, We'll Meet Again, was released in 1939 The London-born singer said: ""This year, we must commemorate this special anniversary apart. ""I hope that VE Day will remind us all that hope remains even in the most difficult of times and that simple acts of bravery and sacrifice still define our nation as the NHS works so hard to care for us. ""Most of all, I hope today serves as a reminder that however hard things get, we will meet again."" Dame Vera is best known for performing for the troops during World War Two in countries including Egypt, India and Burma. Her famous songs include The White Cliffs Of Dover and There'll Always Be An England.

"Notting Hill Carnival was due to take place on 30 and 31 August Notting Hill Carnival has been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. About one million people usually attend the event in west London, which was due to take place on 30 and 31 August. Organisers said the pandemic meant that calling off the weekend was ""the only safe option"", but said they were working on holding a celebration on the same weekend in an alternative form. It is the first time it will not take placein more than 50 years. The carnival, which has been held since 1966, is the latest in a string of summer calendar events to have been postponed, including theGlastonbury Festivaland theTokyo Olympics. The event normally attracts more than one million people to the streets of west London Carnival organisers said the decision followed ""lengthy consultations with our strategic partners and our Advisory Council"". ""This has not been an easy decision to make, but the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic and the way in which it has unfolded means that this is the only safe option,"" they said.

"This video can not be played Any lockdown changes will be ""modest"", says Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The PM says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution"" when considering easing coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson is due to announce plans for England's lockdown on Sunday, but ministers have insisted short term changes to measures will be ""modest"". At the government's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described media reports on easing restrictions as ""not a reliable guide"". He added that changes may vary between the different nations. It comes after Scotland's lockdownwas formally extendedand the Northern Ireland Executive said there was""no headroom"" yet to ease the lockdown. Wales is due to announced itsthe nation's lockdown plans on Friday, after the Welsh government warned media reports speculating how Mr Johnson might ease lockdown measuresrisked sending ""mixed messages""to the public. Some newspapers suggested the rules on exercise could be relaxed and more people encouraged to return to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations - and could lift restrictions at a different rate. Mixed messages across the four nations Is it time to free healthy people from restrictions? What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown The prime minister has told leaders of the devolved nations that he is committed to a UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus ""even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds"", Downing Street said. ""Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation,"" a No 10 spokesman added. The latest figures show the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. The UK provided some 86,583 tests in 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Thursday - meaning the government missed its 100,000-per-day target for the fifth consecutive day. There were reports restrictions on outdoor exercise could be lifted in England from Monday People all over the UK joined in the weekly clap for NHS staff and other key workers on Thursday evening At the briefing, Mr Raab said any short term changes to restrictions would be ""modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored"". He stressed that the existing rules would still apply over the bank holiday weekend and urged people to ""continue to follow the guidance"". Facing pressure over media reports suggesting the lockdown would be eased, the foreign secretary said that reports were ""not a reliable guide"" to future policy decisions. Coronavirus: Is R the crucial number? He added that future decisions would be based on the reproduction number - known as the R level - which represents the average number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to. ""If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren't following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place,"" he said. Mr Raab said the R number was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. However, Prof John Edmunds, who is advising the government, said earlier that it had actually risen slightly - to between 0.75 and one. An R number greater than one would result in exponential growth in the number of cases. But if the number stays lower than one, the disease will eventually peter out as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Sir Ian Diamond, the chief statistician for the Office for National Statistics, saidthe current R numberwas below one. However, he said R had increased since the last estimates due to the rise in virus transmission in care homes. The R number can be different in different parts of the country or in different settings, says the BBC's health reporter Rachel Schraer. ""The question is how contained they are or whether the epidemic in care homes will spread back into the community,"" she said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""right to extend the lockdown"" until the infection rate was under control, saying that ""the health and safety of the nation needs to come first"". He added that ""there needs to be absolute clarity that we must follow the rules"". With much speculation about Sunday's announcement, the government seems keen to manage expectations. Dominic Raab's emphasis was on gradual steps; he spoke of this being a delicate and dangerous moment with the virus remaining deadly. He said the prime minister would set out a road map of how the country might come out of this lockdown, but the government doesn't want to release the handbrake and see the car race away just yet. Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon said she would prefer the UK to make changes as a whole, but said the four nations could decide in a ""grown-up"" manner if they ""want to go different ways"". She added that media reports about the prime minister planning to ease the lockdown had not been discussed with the Scottish government. Earlier, a Welsh government spokesman said it was ""crucially important"" people in Wales were ""informed clearly and accurately"" about any changes to the current restrictions. ""Some of the reporting in today's newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK,"" he added. It comes as the UKbecame the first country in Europeto record more than 30,000 people dying with coronavirus. It has been just over nine weeks since the UK recorded its first death on 2 March. The personal stories of those who have died are continuing to emerge. Among those was Dr Tariq Shafi, 61,who was the lead consultant for haematology for 13 years at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent. Dr Tariq Shaf was described as a ""dedicated and respected"" doctor In other developments: The Bank of England has warned that the pandemicwill push the UK economy towards its deepest recession on record Black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus as white people in England and Wales,according to the Office for National Statistics The UK has said 400,000 surgicalgowns ordered from Turkey do not meet British safety standards Notting Hill Carnival has been cancelled, with organisers saying this was ""the only safe option"" amid the pandemic People have been warned to avoid beauty spots this bank holiday weekend,as temperatures are predicted to soar across England British Airways owner IAG has said it is planning for a ""meaningful return"" of flightsin July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed People across the UKjoined Clap for Carers for the seventh week in a row How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon said she would prefer the UK to make changes as a whole, but said the four nations could decide in a ""grown-up"" manner if they ""want to go different ways"". She added that media reports about the prime minister planning to ease the lockdown had not been discussed with the Scottish government. Earlier, a Welsh government spokesman said it was ""crucially important"" people in Wales were ""informed clearly and accurately"" about any changes to the current restrictions. ""Some of the reporting in today's newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK,"" he added. It comes as the UKbecame the first country in Europeto record more than 30,000 people dying with coronavirus. It has been just over nine weeks since the UK recorded its first death on 2 March. The personal stories of those who have died are continuing to emerge. Among those was Dr Tariq Shafi, 61,who was the lead consultant for haematology for 13 years at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent. Dr Tariq Shaf was described as a ""dedicated and respected"" doctor In other developments: The Bank of England has warned that the pandemicwill push the UK economy towards its deepest recession on record Black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus as white people in England and Wales,according to the Office for National Statistics The UK has said 400,000 surgicalgowns ordered from Turkey do not meet British safety standards Notting Hill Carnival has been cancelled, with organisers saying this was ""the only safe option"" amid the pandemic People have been warned to avoid beauty spots this bank holiday weekend,as temperatures are predicted to soar across England British Airways owner IAG has said it is planning for a ""meaningful return"" of flightsin July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed People across the UKjoined Clap for Carers for the seventh week in a row How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

The Nigerian-British musician was known for a witty, mature style that owed more to the old-school US rappers than the grittier street sounds of London. In 2004, his second album, Upwards, was nominated for the Mercury Prize alongside Amy Winehouse, The Streets and eventual winners Franz Ferdinand. His death was mourned by stars including Ghetts and Roots Manuva.

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

Activists fear that court dates are being indefinitely postponed and claims for asylum simply dismissed without their day in court. In the meantime, the situation inside the shelters and on the streets of Tijuana is steadily getting worse.

Starting on Friday, retail businesses will allow kerbside pickups. Manufacturing will also resume, provided that employees wear masks and stay six feet (two metres) apart. Businesses where staff and customers come into close contact - such as hair salons - have not yet been given the green light to open. Earlier this week, California became the first state to formally request a loan from the federal government to help with swelling jobless claims. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC About 20% of the US workforce - 33.3 million people - have filed for unemployment since mid-March. People from all sectors of society have been affected, including photographer Steve Becker, 62, who says: ""All of my business has been cancelled - I've had no work since February."" He focuses on corporate photography, but businesses have cancelled fundraisers and events, while school graduations have also been delayed. ""My work normally happens in the spring and fall - a lot of corporations don't have events over the summer, so I only have about seven months to make my income. I have some events scheduled for October, but it's not clear whether they're going to go ahead."" Still, he considers himself lucky.

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again. Willinger brewery in Hesse offered the beer to locals on Thursday. Dozens of people queued up while observing social distancing rules. Many took full buckets and boxes home with them. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that breweries across the country are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports. Bavaria's Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, has been cancelled. Shelley Luther refused to close her beauty salon The governor of Texas has amended his lockdown executive order to free a salon owner who was jailed after refusing to close down her business. Gov Greg Abbott's order bans ""confinement as a punishment"" for violating virus mitigation orders. Shelley Luther, the owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, was jailed for contempt of court on Tuesday after she refused to apologise and pay a fine for staying open despite official warnings.

England's Billy Vunipola, Alex Goode and Nick Isiekwe, Scotland back Sean Maitland and prop Josh Ibuanokpe were reportedly spotted in St Albans. The Daily Mail said the players met for a coffee and a chat in the street and did not follow social distancing rules. The Premiership season is currently suspended because of the pandemic. ""Management has spoken to the players involved, all of whom accept that they made an error in judgement,"" said a Saracens statement. ""The club has reminded these players as well as the whole Saracens squad of their responsibilities to themselves and the community around them and we are confident that this will not happen again.""

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say it was a ""brilliant show of support again for our heroic carers and all those on the front line"".

Earlier today, Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that a member of the US military who works at the White House had tested positive. CNN reported that the infected person, who is in the US Navy, was a personal valet to Trump. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played No quick return to normality, says Bank of England chief The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is heading towards its sharpest recession on record. The coronavirus impact would see the economy shrink 14% this year, based on the lockdown being relaxed in June. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank to illustrate the economic impact said Covid-19 was ""dramatically reducing jobs and incomes in the UK"". Bank governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC there would be no quick return to normality. He described the downturn as ""unprecedented"", and said consumers would remain cautious even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Mr Bailey said: ""Not all of the economic activity comes back. There's quite a sharp recovery. But we've also factored that people will be cautious of their own choice. ""They don't re-engage fully, and so it's really only until next summer that activity comes fully back."" Bailey: Coronavirus bounce back 'could be fast' EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workers' wages? UK-US trade talks will not be an easy ride Also on Thursday, policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. However, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on whether to inject more stimulus into the economy. Two of its nine members voted to increase the latest round of quantitative easing by Â£100bn to Â£300bn. The Bank's analysis, published on Thursday, was based on the assumption that social distancing measures are gradually phased out between June and September. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed the UK economy plunging into its first recession in more than a decade. The economy shrinks by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, followed by an unprecedented 25% decline in the three months to June. This would push the UK into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The Bank said the housing market had come to a standstill, while consumer spending had dropped by 30% in recent weeks. For the year as a whole, the economy is expected to contract by 14%. This would be the biggest annual decline on record, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data dating back to 1949. It would also be the sharpest annual contraction since 1706, according to reconstructed Bank of England data stretchingÂ back to the 18th Century. While UK growth is expected to rebound in 2021 to 15%, the size of the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-virus peak until the middle of next year. The UK government isexpected to start easing lockdown restrictions next week. The Bank stressed that the outlook for the economy was ""unusually uncertain"" at present and would depend on how households and businesses responded to the pandemic. It also assumes: The government's jobs retention scheme covering 80% of wages is phased out with the lockdown. Companies stop or scale back their operations for some time. Cautious consumers voluntarily maintain social distancing until mid-2021. Mr Bailey said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be ""relatively small"". The economy was likely to recover ""much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis,"" he said. He also praised the action by the government to support workers and businesses through wage subsidies, loans and grants. He said the success of these schemes and the Bank's own stimulus meant there would be ""limited scarring to the economy"". ""The furloughing scheme really does enable people to come back into the economyÂ more quickly so it's a much quicker recoveryÂ that we've seen in the past."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the hit to the economy this year was equivalent to Â£9,000 for every family in Britain. He said: ""Faced with this huge economic hit, both the Bank and the government have made the right call in taking bold action to protect firms and families as much as possible."" Average weekly earnings are expected to shrink by 2% this year, reflectingÂ the fall in wages for furloughed workers. The Bank said sharp increases in benefit claims were ""consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate"", which is expected to climb above 9% this year, from the current rate of 4%. Under the Bank's scenario, inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) falls to zero at the start of next year amid the sharp drop in energy prices.It is also expected to remain well below the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report said the Bank's scenario was consistent with a 16% drop in house prices. Latest figures published by UK finance show one in seven mortgage holders has taken a payment holiday due to the coronavirus. The Bank said the number of new mortgage deals on offer had halved in just over a month as banks focused on the deluge of payment holiday requests. This includes a huge contraction in deals for buyers with a deposit of less than 40% of the purchase price. The MPC also highlighted the stark drop in consumer spending. It said spending on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment had dropped to a fifth of their previous levels. Shopping at High Street retailers had dropped by 80%, while business confidence was described as ""severely depressed"". Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, described the Bank's scenario as ""optimistic"", particularly its assumption that unemployment would fall back to its pre-crisis low in two years. ""Exactly how the economy evolves will depend critically on how the government calibrates its policies and how they are unwound and tapered,"" he said. ""There is plenty that could go wrong."" The Bank of England itself has minimal staff, but they have applied themselves to try to work out what is happening in the economy. They are not sufficiently confident that the numbers they have run, the charts that they have published, constitute what they would call a ""forecast"". But they do give the clearest indication that we are in recession, after the sharpest, fastest economic contraction in the three-century history of the Bank looking at these things. Faster than the financial crisis, and the Great Depression, and the earlier 1920s depression just before, the only things which come close. ""It is unprecedented in the recent history of this institution,"" Governor Andrew Bailey told me. ""What it really means is that obviously the very sharp sort of downturn, a product of the situation we've been in since March, and the restrictions that are in place, affect economic activity very severely,"" A recession?

"This video can not be played As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes At least 11 people have been killed by a massive gas leak at a chemical plant in southern India, with 800 others taken to hospital. The leak from the LG Polymers plant in the city of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state came as people slept. Doctors say patients have been complaining of a burning sensation in the eyes and difficulties breathing. Areas around the plant have been evacuated. The leak may have been due to negligence, officials say. Reports suggest initial attempts to control the gas leak were unsuccessful but the company and state officials say the situation is now under control. LG said in a statement it was investigating the cause of the incident, and was looking at ways ""to provide speedy treatment"" for those affected. Rajendra Reddy, a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, told the BBC that the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called an emergency disaster meeting. The leak took place at around 03:00 local time (21:30 GMT Wednesday) as the plant was being re-opened for the first time since 24 March, when India went into lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""All those who have been hospitalised are currently stable,"" BK Naik, a local health official, told Reuters news agency. Doctors say 86 patients are being treated on ventilators, but many injured have been discharged. Legal action is being taken against the company, says state Industries Minister Goutam Reddy. Earlier, he told BBC Telugu that it looked as though proper procedures and guidelines were not followed when the South Korean-owned plant was being re-opened. ""We would like the company to proactively respond to the incident and ensure that the same level of responsibility is taken if this incident were to happen in EU or United States,"" he said, adding that the incident had been reported to the Korean embassy. Hundreds have taken ill after the gas leak at a polymer factory Swaroop Rani, a senior police official in Visakhapatnam, told AFP that the plant had been left idle because of the lockdown. ""[The gas] was left there because of the lockdown. It led to a chemical reaction and heat was produced inside the tanks, and the gas leaked because of that."" Local villagers complained around 03:30 and police immediately went to the scene, but had to quickly retreat for fear of being poisoned, the news agency quoted her as saying. ""One could feel the gas in the air and it was not possible for any of us to stay there for more than a few minutes,"" she said. As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes in panic. Distressing images of people fainting and dropping unconscious on the streets are being shared on social media. ""My eyes were itchy, and I was feeling drowsy, light-headed and slightly breathless,"" Yashwanth Saikumar Ambati, who lives about 300 metres from the plant, told Reuters. Officials said the fumes had spread over a radius of about 3km (2 miles) and people from surrounding areas were evacuated. Although a large number have been admitted to hospital, most should be able to make a recovery, they added. Vijay Gajam, BBC News Telugu A loud banging on the front door woke me up at 03:30. My wife and I rushed to the door, and found our neighbours outside, looking agitated. ""There has been an explosion at Polymers! Leave immediately,"" they told us. I could see people running on the road outside. I spotted my landlord, who also asked me to leave the house as soon as I could. Just then, I began to smell something pungent in the air. We quickly understood what had happened. The smell became stronger and my eyes began to burn. My wife, son and I left the house on my motorbike. As we drove down the street, we saw hundreds of people were fleeing their homes. We kept going until we reached Kailasagiri beach, about 20km away. We only stopped when we couldn't smell the gas any more. Earlier in the day, district health official Dr Naik said many people were feared to be unconscious in their homes. ""There are people who were sleeping,"" AFP quoted him as saying. ""We are working to get people to the hospital. They need oxygenation and fresh air. ""We are trying to understand the long-term impact of the chemical on those who have inhaled it during the leak."" Officials said the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated In the meantime, officials have asked people to protect themselves by covering their faces with a wet cloth. The Indian navy has been helping supply oxygen to patients. India has a tragic history of gas leaks. In 1984, a toxic chemical leak in a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal killed thousands of people, in what is acknowledged to be the world's worst industrial disaster. More than 35 years later, victims say children are still being born with disabilities because of the effects of the methyl isocyanate gas spill. Reporting by BBC Telugu's Satish Balla and Deepthi Bathini Styrene is a colourless, or light yellow, flammable liquid primarily used in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins - it is used in the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs, packaging, synthetic marble, flooring, disposable tableware and moulded furniture Breathing air contaminated with styrene vapours can cause irritation of the nose and throat, coughing and wheezing, and create a build-up of fluid in the lungs Exposure to larger amounts can result in the onset of ""styrene sickness"", the signs and symptoms of which include headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, tiredness, dizziness, confusion and clumsy or unsteady motion (known collectively as central nervous system depression) In some cases exposure to styrene can also result in irregular heartbeats and even coma Several epidemiologic studies suggest there may be an association between styrene exposure and an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma though the evidence is inconclusive Sources: The PHE Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards and US Environment Protection Agency Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"Heathrow Airport has been granted permission to appeal against a block on its plans for a third runway. In February the Court of Appeal found the government decision to allow the plans to go ahead was unlawful. At the time the court said the government had not taken its climate commitments into account, but Heathrow said it would appeal. The Supreme Court has now given permission for an appeal to go ahead. Heathrow said it would go ahead with the appeal, despite the aviation sector taking a massive hit from the coronavirus crisis. An airport spokesman said: ""Responding to the impacts of coronavirus is our priority right now. We do believe that once the benefits of air travel and connectivity have been restored in years to come, an expanded Heathrow will be required."" The Heathrow spokesman added that the privately funded project would ""see billions of pounds pumped into the UK's economy, stimulating sectors across the country and creating tens of thousands of new jobs."" However, Friends of the Earth, which was one of the groups that brought the case against Heathrow, said investment should instead be put into green infrastructure projects. ""It is especially important now, as we plan for a future after the dreadful coronavirus pandemic, that the UK invests in low-carbon, resilient infrastructure. A new runway at Heathrow is the opposite of what we need to be building,"" said Friends of the Earth pollution campaigner Jenny Bates. Will Rundle, head of legal at Friends of the Earth, said: ""We'll resist the appeal brought by Heathrow Airport and the developer Aurora Holdings, in the Supreme Court. ""Climate change must be front and centre in all planning and infrastructure decisions, and it is irresponsible for them to try and avoid the Court of Appeal's verdict against them on climate change by this appeal. In February, the Court of Appeal found that the government had not followed UK policy when backing the controversial expansion plans. It said that the government had a duty to take into account the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit global warming. It was ""legally fatal"" to the government's Heathrow expansion policy that it did not take those climate commitments into account, the judges said at the time. On Thursday, three Supreme Court Justices - Lord Reed, Lord Hodge and Lord Sales -  gave permission to appeal that judgement. British Airways-owner IAG, which has in the past criticised the expansion's costs and called for an independent review of the environmental impact, said: ""The challenges facing Heathrow's expansion are immense and even greater now following [the coronavirus crisis]."" However, the CBI industry group said: ""Ensuring a safe return to work after coronavirus is business' top priority right now, but an expanded Heathrow can play an important role in driving prosperity over the long term. ""Businesses will be pleased that Heathrow has been given the opportunity to get this critical project back on track."" And Adam Marshal, director general of industry group the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Businesses are clear that an expanded Heathrow will provide crucial regional connectivity, access to key markets across the world and wider economic benefits extending across the UK. ""While attention is rightly focused on the immediate response to coronavirus, firms will be hoping that long-overdue plans for a world-leading hub airport can move ahead in due course to help power recovery and future growth.""

"This video can not be played Any lockdown changes will be ""modest"", says Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The PM says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution"" when considering easing coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson is due to announce plans for England's lockdown on Sunday, but ministers have insisted short term changes to measures will be ""modest"". At the government's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described media reports on easing restrictions as ""not a reliable guide"". He added that changes may vary between the different nations. It comes after Scotland's lockdownwas formally extendedand the Northern Ireland Executive said there was""no headroom"" yet to ease the lockdown. Wales is due to announced itsthe nation's lockdown plans on Friday, after the Welsh government warned media reports speculating how Mr Johnson might ease lockdown measuresrisked sending ""mixed messages""to the public. Some newspapers suggested the rules on exercise could be relaxed and more people encouraged to return to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations - and could lift restrictions at a different rate. Mixed messages across the four nations Is it time to free healthy people from restrictions? What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown The prime minister has told leaders of the devolved nations that he is committed to a UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus ""even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds"", Downing Street said. ""Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation,"" a No 10 spokesman added. The latest figures show the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. The UK provided some 86,583 tests in 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Thursday - meaning the government missed its 100,000-per-day target for the fifth consecutive day. There were reports restrictions on outdoor exercise could be lifted in England from Monday People all over the UK joined in the weekly clap for NHS staff and other key workers on Thursday evening At the briefing, Mr Raab said any short term changes to restrictions would be ""modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored"". He stressed that the existing rules would still apply over the bank holiday weekend and urged people to ""continue to follow the guidance"". Facing pressure over media reports suggesting the lockdown would be eased, the foreign secretary said that reports were ""not a reliable guide"" to future policy decisions. Coronavirus: Is R the crucial number? He added that future decisions would be based on the reproduction number - known as the R level - which represents the average number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to. ""If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren't following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place,"" he said. Mr Raab said the R number was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. However, Prof John Edmunds, who is advising the government, said earlier that it had actually risen slightly - to between 0.75 and one. An R number greater than one would result in exponential growth in the number of cases. But if the number stays lower than one, the disease will eventually peter out as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Sir Ian Diamond, the chief statistician for the Office for National Statistics, saidthe current R numberwas below one. However, he said R had increased since the last estimates due to the rise in virus transmission in care homes. The R number can be different in different parts of the country or in different settings, says the BBC's health reporter Rachel Schraer. ""The question is how contained they are or whether the epidemic in care homes will spread back into the community,"" she said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""right to extend the lockdown"" until the infection rate was under control, saying that ""the health and safety of the nation needs to come first"". He added that ""there needs to be absolute clarity that we must follow the rules"". With much speculation about Sunday's announcement, the government seems keen to manage expectations. Dominic Raab's emphasis was on gradual steps; he spoke of this being a delicate and dangerous moment with the virus remaining deadly. He said the prime minister would set out a road map of how the country might come out of this lockdown, but the government doesn't want to release the handbrake and see the car race away just yet. Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon said she would prefer the UK to make changes as a whole, but said the four nations could decide in a ""grown-up"" manner if they ""want to go different ways"". She added that media reports about the prime minister planning to ease the lockdown had not been discussed with the Scottish government. Earlier, a Welsh government spokesman said it was ""crucially important"" people in Wales were ""informed clearly and accurately"" about any changes to the current restrictions. ""Some of the reporting in today's newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK,"" he added. It comes as the UKbecame the first country in Europeto record more than 30,000 people dying with coronavirus. It has been just over nine weeks since the UK recorded its first death on 2 March. The personal stories of those who have died are continuing to emerge. Among those was Dr Tariq Shafi, 61,who was the lead consultant for haematology for 13 years at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent. Dr Tariq Shaf was described as a ""dedicated and respected"" doctor In other developments: The Bank of England has warned that the pandemicwill push the UK economy towards its deepest recession on record Black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus as white people in England and Wales,according to the Office for National Statistics The UK has said 400,000 surgicalgowns ordered from Turkey do not meet British safety standards Notting Hill Carnival has been cancelled, with organisers saying this was ""the only safe option"" amid the pandemic People have been warned to avoid beauty spots this bank holiday weekend,as temperatures are predicted to soar across England British Airways owner IAG has said it is planning for a ""meaningful return"" of flightsin July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed People across the UKjoined Clap for Carers for the seventh week in a row How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"The European Union faces a deep and uneven recession, according to a new forecast from the EU's Commission. The bloc's executive arm predicts a recovery in 2021 but warns that the uncertainty is exceptionally high. The Commission predicts a decline in economic activity this year of 7.5%, and slightly more than that for the eurozone. It warns the outcome could be worse if the pandemic turns out to be longer or more severe than currently envisaged. European and other governments are intentionally blocking economic activity to contain the virus, so a sharp downturn is inevitable. That said, the Commission's forecasts do put some rather stark numbers on the extent of the damage the EU can expect to sustain. The Commission describes the downturn as a recession of historic proportions. Paolo Gentiloni, the Commissioner for the Economy called it ""a shock without precedent since the Great Depression"". The impact will be uneven, Mr Gentiloni said, conditioned by how quickly the lockdowns can be lifted and by the importance of services such as tourism in the national economies. The forecasts for specific countries do indeed point to an especially severe impact in some that that are popular tourist destinations. The deepest predicted contraction of all is for Greece. At 9.7% that would be more than the worst in single year during the financial crisis, although the country did have a succession of bad years that added up to a much larger decline than is likely in 2020. Spain and Italy are also forecast to have declines in excess of 9%. The revisions to the forecasts for two other Mediterranean countries- Malta and Cyprus - were also relatively large. Inevitably, such an extensive impact on economic activity will mean job losses. The Commission says that policies such as short-time working schemes, job subsidies and support to businesses should help to limit the damage to employment, but the impact on the labour market will nonetheless be severe. The report predicts an increase in unemployment in every EU state. That said, the predicted highs are not as bad as they were in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The two worst for predictions for this year are unemployment rates of 19.9% for Greece and 18.9% for Spain. Those figures are annual averages so there would be peaks during the year that are significantly higher. But those annual figures are still well below the equivalent levels, which were in the high twenties, that the two countries suffered as a result of the following the financial crisis. It will be harder, the Commission says, for young people to get their first jobs. The growth predicted for 2021 at 6.1% is less than the contraction the Commission envisages for this year. It would therefore be 2022 at the earliest when the EU economy gets back to the level of activity it experienced last year. The report also notes that unsuccessful trade negotiations with the UK could further impede any recovery: ""The threat of tariffs [on traded goods] following the end of the transition period between the EU and United Kingdom could also dampen growth, albeit to a lesser extent in the EU than in the UK.""

"The chancellor has the most delicate of balancing acts over the eventual withdrawal of the Job Retention Scheme. From inception, it was not just a massive piece of government support spending, but, as importantly, a piece of mass applied psychology. The ""furlough"" scheme was designed to get into the heads of employers and persuade them to hold off on firing workers from businesses suffering in the pandemic shutdowns. To park them, to put them on ""standby mode"" as one cabinet minister put it to me, so they could be switched back on to contribute to a V-shaped bounce back recovery when the pandemic peak passed. That has worked. Universal Credit applications have gone up by 1.8 million, but without the furlough scheme it would have been multiples of that. Crucially, it has kept workers contractually connected to their workplaces. This helps avoid what economists call ""hysteresis"" - the scarring effect of unemployment on the economy and public finances over many years. Some 6.3 million jobs are currently being paid for by government, approaching one in four of total UK employments. Universal Credit applications have soared But at Â£8bn so far, it is possible that the expert forecasts of a total cost of Â£39bn by July, is reached, which does put the cost of the scheme per month at the same order as monthly NHS funding. So while the government says the spending has been good value for money, it is also, in the chancellor's words not sustainable. This has led to a suggestion that support will be pulled, and the Treasury clarifying that there will be no ""cliff edge"". The Treasury did not say that people were ""addicted"" to the funding - it has only just started to be paid out. But their dilemma is that they do want to give a broad signal that employers should not become dependent on the scheme - they should expect to get their workforces back working and earning, as safe social distancing arrangements are agreed. At the same time they want to reassure that the scheme will be fully available until the end of June, and then will be eased out, in some form. All options are being discussed on how to phase it out. The amount could be reduced from 80%. Its sectoral application could mirror the phasing in of the reopening of sectors of the economy. Perhaps the most interesting idea is to learn from the Irish and the Germans on applying the scheme more flexibly, and allowing hours rather than jobs to be furloughed, instantly removing the necessity for employers to require that employees do not work. Virgin Atlantic has seen passenger numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans This is being pushed by some business groups, and the opposition Labour Party too. Some Conservative thinkers have even suggested privately, as is the case in Germany, that a scheme such as this, could be made semi-permanent. The Kurzarbeit system, which is a century-old is credited with saving a million jobs a decade ago, and is paid at 60% of wages, but is untaxed and applies to hours lost rather than requiring a worker to stop employment. Such a scheme would basically be an expensive form of employment insurance, operating through the private sector rather than the Department for Work and Pensions. This is not in the Treasury's plans, as they seek to reaffirm the support is temporary. But the behavioural economics of withdrawing support in any form is very delicate. It was the aviation industry who last week asked for the scheme to be extended into and past July. The loss of thousands of jobs in that sector followed clarification that such a move should not be relied on, for an industry facing a fundamental long-lasting change in trading conditions. The aviation industry is now saying even after those losses that the scheme needs to be extended until October. But the message has gone out, in vague terms not to get too reliant on this extraordinary form of funding. But if the impression emerged that the scheme was to be wrapped up too quickly, as one business group leader told me, it would lead to hundreds of thousands of instant job losses. Many options are being discussed. No decisions have been taken yet. But clarity will be needed quickly. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

Starting on Friday, retail businesses will allow kerbside pickups. Manufacturing will also resume, provided that employees wear masks and stay six feet (two metres) apart. Businesses where staff and customers come into close contact - such as hair salons - have not yet been given the green light to open. Earlier this week, California became the first state to formally request a loan from the federal government to help with swelling jobless claims. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC About 20% of the US workforce - 33.3 million people - have filed for unemployment since mid-March. People from all sectors of society have been affected, including photographer Steve Becker, 62, who says: ""All of my business has been cancelled - I've had no work since February."" He focuses on corporate photography, but businesses have cancelled fundraisers and events, while school graduations have also been delayed. ""My work normally happens in the spring and fall - a lot of corporations don't have events over the summer, so I only have about seven months to make my income.

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"".

daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour.

"London Zoo has only ever shut for any length of time once before, for two weeks during the Blitz London Zoo and its conservation work face an ""uncertain future"" without immediate support, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has warned. ZSL London Zoo and its sister site Whipsnade Zoo, in Bedfordshire, have been closed to visitors since 20 March due to the coronavirus lockdown. This has come at what is usually a peak time, when they would have expected 250,000 visitors, ZSL said. The charity's core income has dried up while costs for staff remain the same. London Zoo has only ever shut for any length of time once before, for two weeks during the Blitz, before it reopened at the request of the government to boost morale in the capital. This video can not be played What does London Zoo look like on lockdown? ZSL currently cares for 20,000 animals, many of which are rare and endangered. The income from the two zoos underpins ZSL's scientific research institute and global conservation programmes, which help research diseases in wildlife, including coronaviruses. Director general Dominic Jermey said lockdown was putting it in a ""very challenging"" position. ZSL said it was struggling to obtain financial support from banks, because the organisation has no history of borrowing. It currently operates to invest everything back into conservation and science, making it hard to generate profits to pay off a loan. Costs for keepers and vets to care for 20,000 animals remain the same, despite a lack of income Ministers have announced a Â£14m fund to support zoos hit by the pandemic lockdown but ZSL said the focus was on small grants for small zoos and an institution of its size needed much more significant support. Mr Jermey said: ""We are having conversations with very generous people who have supported us in the past, and with banks, in order to make sure the future does not remain perilous. ""But at the moment it's a very challenging moment for the organisation."" The idea that the pandemic could spell the end of London Zoo ""would be absolutely unthinkable"", he said. ""But the plain facts of any organisation is we can't continue to operate without any income."" Mr Jermey said ZSL was ""determined to be part of the solution"", with its work on wildlife diseases and, as lockdown begins to ease, by offering people an outdoor space they can experience safely.

"Mobile operator O2 and broadband giant Virgin Media are to merge, creating one of the UK's largest entertainment and telecoms firms and a major rival to BT. Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, and Spain's Telefonica, which owns O2, said they had agreed terms for joining forces. Consumer group Which? called on the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the deal. It said the tie-up ""could have a significant impact on consumers"". Which? added: ""Neither provider stands out in our recent customer satisfaction surveys, and any merger should only be allowed to go ahead if it delivers positive outcomes for consumers."" O2 has about 34 million mobile phone users, while Virgin has about six million broadband and cable TV customers and another three million mobile users. As well as having its own subscribers, O2 provides the network for Tesco Mobile, Giffgaff and Sky Mobile. Telefonica chief executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said: ""Combining O2's number one mobile business with Virgin Media's superfast broadband network and entertainment services will be a game-changer in the UK, at a time when demand for connectivity has never been greater or more critical."" Despite Which?'s concerns about the deal, some analysts said customers were set to benefit by having access to more services, although it is unclear whether cost savings from the tie-up will be passed on to consumers. Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at price comparison website Uswitch.com, said he did not expect customers to lose out. ""It will be interesting to see what this means for existing customers in terms of products and access to extra services, such as O2 Priorities. ""For all customers there is the exciting prospect of greater breadth of entertainment and faster speeds to look forward to."" Karen Egan, telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis, told the BBC's Today programme the deal was ""a fortuitous marrying of objectives"" for the two parent companies. Telefonica was ""keen to monetise"" its stake in O2, while Liberty Global had long believed in combining fixed-line and mobile networks, she said. The new merged company would now be able to ""diversify and match some of BT's innovative products"", she added. Virgin Media and O2 are celebrating the creation of a powerful competitor to BT as a converged communications business. They appear confident that their merger will be waved through by the competition regulator - but that assumes the deal is self-evidently good for consumers. Will removing one player from the telecoms market really mean better prices and improved service for Virgin and O2 customers? The firms are insisting that it will give them the resources for the huge job of extending full fibre broadband and 5G across the UK, promising to spend Â£10bn over the next five years.  But the consumer group Which? isn't convinced, pointing to the patchy customer service record of both firms and calling for an inquiry. Having allowed a merger between BT and EE in 2016, it seems unlikely that the Competition and Markets Authority will block this deal. But Virgin O2 - or whatever brand they choose - can still expect plenty of regulatory scrutiny, even after their marriage is approved. The companies said O2 would be valued at Â£12.7bn and Virgin Media at Â£18.7bn, both on a total enterprise value basis. ""O2 [is] to be transferred into the joint venture on a debt-free basis, while Virgin Media to be contributed with Â£11.3bn of net debt and debt-like items,"" the firms said in a joint statement. Telefonica tried to sell O2 to the owner of Three, CK Hutchison, for Â£10.3bn in 2015. However, thatdeal was blockedby the European Commission over concerns that it would have left just three major mobile phone operators in the UK.

"This video can not be played No quick return to normality, says Bank of England chief The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is heading towards its sharpest recession on record. The coronavirus impact would see the economy shrink 14% this year, based on the lockdown being relaxed in June. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank to illustrate the economic impact said Covid-19 was ""dramatically reducing jobs and incomes in the UK"". Bank governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC there would be no quick return to normality. He described the downturn as ""unprecedented"", and said consumers would remain cautious even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Mr Bailey said: ""Not all of the economic activity comes back. There's quite a sharp recovery. But we've also factored that people will be cautious of their own choice. ""They don't re-engage fully, and so it's really only until next summer that activity comes fully back."" Bailey: Coronavirus bounce back 'could be fast' EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workers' wages? UK-US trade talks will not be an easy ride Also on Thursday, policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. However, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on whether to inject more stimulus into the economy. Two of its nine members voted to increase the latest round of quantitative easing by Â£100bn to Â£300bn. The Bank's analysis, published on Thursday, was based on the assumption that social distancing measures are gradually phased out between June and September. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed the UK economy plunging into its first recession in more than a decade. The economy shrinks by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, followed by an unprecedented 25% decline in the three months to June. This would push the UK into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The Bank said the housing market had come to a standstill, while consumer spending had dropped by 30% in recent weeks. For the year as a whole, the economy is expected to contract by 14%. This would be the biggest annual decline on record, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data dating back to 1949. It would also be the sharpest annual contraction since 1706, according to reconstructed Bank of England data stretchingÂ back to the 18th Century. While UK growth is expected to rebound in 2021 to 15%, the size of the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-virus peak until the middle of next year. The UK government isexpected to start easing lockdown restrictions next week. The Bank stressed that the outlook for the economy was ""unusually uncertain"" at present and would depend on how households and businesses responded to the pandemic. It also assumes: The government's jobs retention scheme covering 80% of wages is phased out with the lockdown. Companies stop or scale back their operations for some time. Cautious consumers voluntarily maintain social distancing until mid-2021. Mr Bailey said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be ""relatively small"". The economy was likely to recover ""much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis,"" he said. He also praised the action by the government to support workers and businesses through wage subsidies, loans and grants. He said the success of these schemes and the Bank's own stimulus meant there would be ""limited scarring to the economy"". ""The furloughing scheme really does enable people to come back into the economyÂ more quickly so it's a much quicker recoveryÂ that we've seen in the past."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the hit to the economy this year was equivalent to Â£9,000 for every family in Britain. He said: ""Faced with this huge economic hit, both the Bank and the government have made the right call in taking bold action to protect firms and families as much as possible."" Average weekly earnings are expected to shrink by 2% this year, reflectingÂ the fall in wages for furloughed workers. The Bank said sharp increases in benefit claims were ""consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate"", which is expected to climb above 9% this year, from the current rate of 4%. Under the Bank's scenario, inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) falls to zero at the start of next year amid the sharp drop in energy prices.It is also expected to remain well below the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report said the Bank's scenario was consistent with a 16% drop in house prices. Latest figures published by UK finance show one in seven mortgage holders has taken a payment holiday due to the coronavirus. The Bank said the number of new mortgage deals on offer had halved in just over a month as banks focused on the deluge of payment holiday requests. This includes a huge contraction in deals for buyers with a deposit of less than 40% of the purchase price. The MPC also highlighted the stark drop in consumer spending. It said spending on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment had dropped to a fifth of their previous levels. Shopping at High Street retailers had dropped by 80%, while business confidence was described as ""severely depressed"". Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, described the Bank's scenario as ""optimistic"", particularly its assumption that unemployment would fall back to its pre-crisis low in two years. ""Exactly how the economy evolves will depend critically on how the government calibrates its policies and how they are unwound and tapered,"" he said. ""There is plenty that could go wrong."" The Bank of England itself has minimal staff, but they have applied themselves to try to work out what is happening in the economy. They are not sufficiently confident that the numbers they have run, the charts that they have published, constitute what they would call a ""forecast"". But they do give the clearest indication that we are in recession, after the sharpest, fastest economic contraction in the three-century history of the Bank looking at these things. Faster than the financial crisis, and the Great Depression, and the earlier 1920s depression just before, the only things which come close. ""It is unprecedented in the recent history of this institution,"" Governor Andrew Bailey told me. ""What it really means is that obviously the very sharp sort of downturn, a product of the situation we've been in since March, and the restrictions that are in place, affect economic activity very severely,"" A recession? ""Yes,"" he replied. Read Faisal's blog here. Islam: Bounce back could be fast, says Bank's Bailey EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workersâ wages?

Seddon and Lucy Webster. Ty, the acclaimed, Mercury-nominated UK rapper, has died aged 47 after contracting coronavirus. The Nigerian-British musician was known for a witty, mature style that owed more to the old-school US rappers than the grittier street sounds of London. In 2004, his second album, Upwards, was nominated for the Mercury Prize alongside Amy Winehouse, The Streets and eventual winners Franz Ferdinand. His death was mourned by stars including Ghetts and Roots Manuva.

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

Activists fear that court dates are being indefinitely postponed and claims for asylum simply dismissed without their day in court. In the meantime, the situation inside the shelters and on the streets of Tijuana is steadily getting worse.

Well, many vets are still working hard, including staff at Hart Wildlife Rescue near Alton in Hampshire. They've told the BBC they've had fewer call-outs to animals being hit by vehicles but have seen a rise in animal and bird injuries in gardens. Baby owl, Waffle, is among those who are glad they stayed open. A skater outside the closed Amoeba Music store, a Hollywood landmark California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the unprecedented two-month lockdown of the state - which put approximately four million people out work - is lifting on some businesses. Starting on Friday, retail businesses will allow kerbside pickups. Manufacturing will also resume, provided that employees wear masks and stay six feet (two metres) apart. Businesses where staff and customers come into close contact - such as hair salons - have not yet been given the green light to open. Earlier this week, California became the first state to formally request a loan from the federal government to help with swelling jobless claims. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC About 20% of the US workforce - 33.3 million people - have filed for unemployment since mid-March. People from all sectors of society have been affected, including photographer Steve Becker, 62, who says: ""All of my business has been cancelled - I've had no work since February."" He focuses on corporate photography, but businesses have cancelled fundraisers and events, while school graduations have also been delayed. ""My work normally happens in the spring and fall - a lot of corporations don't have events over the summer, so I only have about seven months to make my income. I have some events scheduled for October, but it's not clear whether they're going to go ahead."" Still, he considers himself lucky. ""My partner works, and I'm very blessed I was able to do what I enjoy and make a good living out of it. It takes a lot of perseverance, and I miss going out and talking to people.""

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again. Willinger brewery in Hesse offered the beer to locals on Thursday. Dozens of people queued up while observing social distancing rules. Many took full buckets and boxes home with them. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that breweries across the country are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports. Bavaria's Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, has been cancelled. Shelley Luther refused to close her beauty salon The governor of Texas has amended his lockdown executive order to free a salon owner who was jailed after refusing to close down her business. Gov Greg Abbott's order bans ""confinement as a punishment"" for violating virus mitigation orders. Shelley Luther, the owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, was jailed for contempt of court on Tuesday after she refused to apologise and pay a fine for staying open despite official warnings. Texas is nearing 1,000 Covid-19 deaths and 35,000 infections.

England's Billy Vunipola, Alex Goode and Nick Isiekwe, Scotland back Sean Maitland and prop Josh Ibuanokpe were reportedly spotted in St Albans. The Daily Mail said the players met for a coffee and a chat in the street and did not follow social distancing rules. The Premiership season is currently suspended because of the pandemic. ""Management has spoken to the players involved, all of whom accept that they made an error in judgement,"" said a Saracens statement. ""The club has reminded these players as well as the whole Saracens squad of their responsibilities to themselves and the community around them and we are confident that this will not happen again.""

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say it was a ""brilliant show of support again for our heroic carers and all those on the front line"". Residents clap in a street in Northampton People clap for carers on their balconies in London A woman claps in her garden in Cardiff Applause outside a hospital in Salford The president says he was tested on Wednesday and Thursday President Donald Trump has told reporters that coronavirus testing at the White House will be increased from once a week to once per day after an aide who works in close contact with Trump tested positive for the virus. âIâve had very little contact with this person,â he said in the White House Oval Office, adding that he had himself been tested on Wednesday and Thursday. Earlier today, Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that a member of the US military who works at the White House had tested positive. CNN reported that the infected person, who is in the US Navy, was a personal valet to Trump. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes At least 11 people have been killed by a massive gas leak at a chemical plant in southern India, with 800 others taken to hospital. The leak from the LG Polymers plant in the city of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state came as people slept. Doctors say patients have been complaining of a burning sensation in the eyes and difficulties breathing. Areas around the plant have been evacuated. The leak may have been due to negligence, officials say. Reports suggest initial attempts to control the gas leak were unsuccessful but the company and state officials say the situation is now under control. LG said in a statement it was investigating the cause of the incident, and was looking at ways ""to provide speedy treatment"" for those affected. Rajendra Reddy, a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, told the BBC that the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called an emergency disaster meeting. The leak took place at around 03:00 local time (21:30 GMT Wednesday) as the plant was being re-opened for the first time since 24 March, when India went into lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""All those who have been hospitalised are currently stable,"" BK Naik, a local health official, told Reuters news agency. Doctors say 86 patients are being treated on ventilators, but many injured have been discharged. Legal action is being taken against the company, says state Industries Minister Goutam Reddy. Earlier, he told BBC Telugu that it looked as though proper procedures and guidelines were not followed when the South Korean-owned plant was being re-opened. ""We would like the company to proactively respond to the incident and ensure that the same level of responsibility is taken if this incident were to happen in EU or United States,"" he said, adding that the incident had been reported to the Korean embassy. Hundreds have taken ill after the gas leak at a polymer factory Swaroop Rani, a senior police official in Visakhapatnam, told AFP that the plant had been left idle because of the lockdown. ""[The gas] was left there because of the lockdown. It led to a chemical reaction and heat was produced inside the tanks, and the gas leaked because of that."" Local villagers complained around 03:30 and police immediately went to the scene, but had to quickly retreat for fear of being poisoned, the news agency quoted her as saying. ""One could feel the gas in the air and it was not possible for any of us to stay there for more than a few minutes,"" she said. As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes in panic. Distressing images of people fainting and dropping unconscious on the streets are being shared on social media. ""My eyes were itchy, and I was feeling drowsy, light-headed and slightly breathless,"" Yashwanth Saikumar Ambati, who lives about 300 metres from the plant, told Reuters. Officials said the fumes had spread over a radius of about 3km (2 miles) and people from surrounding areas were evacuated. Although a large number have been admitted to hospital, most should be able to make a recovery, they added. Vijay Gajam, BBC News Telugu A loud banging on the front door woke me up at 03:30. My wife and I rushed to the door, and found our neighbours outside, looking agitated. ""There has been an explosion at Polymers! Leave immediately,"" they told us. I could see people running on the road outside. I spotted my landlord, who also asked me to leave the house as soon as I could. Just then, I began to smell something pungent in the air. We quickly understood what had happened. The smell became stronger and my eyes began to burn. My wife, son and I left the house on my motorbike. As we drove down the street, we saw hundreds of people were fleeing their homes. We kept going until we reached Kailasagiri beach, about 20km away. We only stopped when we couldn't smell the gas any more. Earlier in the day, district health official Dr Naik said many people were feared to be unconscious in their homes. ""There are people who were sleeping,"" AFP quoted him as saying. ""We are working to get people to the hospital. They need oxygenation and fresh air. ""We are trying to understand the long-term impact of the chemical on those who have inhaled it during the leak."" Officials said the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated In the meantime, officials have asked people to protect themselves by covering their faces with a wet cloth. The Indian navy has been helping supply oxygen to patients. India has a tragic history of gas leaks. In 1984, a toxic chemical leak in a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal killed thousands of people, in what is acknowledged to be the world's worst industrial disaster. More than 35 years later, victims say children are still being born with disabilities because of the effects of the methyl isocyanate gas spill.

"London Zoo has only ever shut for any length of time once before, for two weeks during the Blitz London Zoo and its conservation work face an ""uncertain future"" without immediate support, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has warned. ZSL London Zoo and its sister site Whipsnade Zoo, in Bedfordshire, have been closed to visitors since 20 March due to the coronavirus lockdown. This has come at what is usually a peak time, when they would have expected 250,000 visitors, ZSL said. The charity's core income has dried up while costs for staff remain the same. London Zoo has only ever shut for any length of time once before, for two weeks during the Blitz, before it reopened at the request of the government to boost morale in the capital. This video can not be played What does London Zoo look like on lockdown? ZSL currently cares for 20,000 animals, many of which are rare and endangered. The income from the two zoos underpins ZSL's scientific research institute and global conservation programmes, which help research diseases in wildlife, including coronaviruses. Director general Dominic Jermey said lockdown was putting it in a ""very challenging"" position. ZSL said it was struggling to obtain financial support from banks, because the organisation has no history of borrowing. It currently operates to invest everything back into conservation and science, making it hard to generate profits to pay off a loan. Costs for keepers and vets to care for 20,000 animals remain the same, despite a lack of income Ministers have announced a Â£14m fund to support zoos hit by the pandemic lockdown but ZSL said the focus was on small grants for small zoos and an institution of its size needed much more significant support. Mr Jermey said: ""We are having conversations with very generous people who have supported us in the past, and with banks, in order to make sure the future does not remain perilous. ""But at the moment it's a very challenging moment for the organisation."" The idea that the pandemic could spell the end of London Zoo ""would be absolutely unthinkable"", he said. ""But the plain facts of any organisation is we can't continue to operate without any income."" Mr Jermey said ZSL was ""determined to be part of the solution"", with its work on wildlife diseases and, as lockdown begins to ease, by offering people an outdoor space they can experience safely.

"""It was embarrassing, everyone was looking at us,"" Susan Bleau says of the moment she tried to spend free school meal vouchers worth Â£45. After weeks of delays, her daughter's school had finally received the vouchers and printed them out for her. But at the till, with a trolley full of shopping, the vouchers failed to scan. Edenred, which runs the government scheme to give pupils in England vouchers worth Â£15 a week, says all of its vouchers are valid. But ever since it was set up, in late March, the scheme has been beset by problems. The system was rebuilt over the Easter break but the improvements were slow to take effect, with schools still  struggling to log on, parents unable to download the vouchers and some even saying the vouchers failed when they tried to spend them. Families still wait for free school meal vouchers 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat With the newly printed vouchers in her pocket, Susan and her 11-year-old daughter had taken the bus from their home in Wembley, north London, to Tesco at Brent Park and queued outside before picking out what they needed. ""We had everything - cheese, pizzas, yoghurt, smoothies,"" Susan says. But when they tried to use the vouchers to pay, they would not scan. As the queue built up behind them, the cashier called the manager, who tried to enter the barcodes manually before pronouncing them faulty. All the shopping had to go back and the pair had to leave empty-handed, humiliated and disappointed. ""You're not the first and you won't be the last,"" Susan remembers one of the supermarket staff saying. It was a Saturday, so all Susan could do was leave a message on the school voicemail and wait for replacement vouchers the following week. ""We had to live on what we had which, wasn't enough but we had to cope,"" she says. Raphael Moss, their head teacher, at Elsley Primary, who knows of at least one other family this has happened to, says: ""I can't imagine how distressing and embarrassing that must have been."" Tesco says it is not aware of widespread issues when customers redeem their vouchers in its stores. And Edenred insists every supermarket eGift voucher it sends to parents is valid. The company suggests poor or damaged printed copies could be responsible for some of the failures. But many school leaders believe the problem is not uncommon. ""This has happened to so many of our parents,"" said one head on Twitter. And Martin Knowles, head teacher of Essa academy, in Bolton, says about one in five of parents in receipt of the vouchers has had problems at the till. He says the school is considering abandoning the Edenred vouchers and setting up its own scheme, at a cost of Â£8,500 a week, if the problems continue. Chiswick School, in west London, continues to hear from parents whose redeemed vouchers do not work at the tills, according to school business manager Danny Sohal. Other school leaders, from London, Cornwall, the West Midlands, and the north-east of England, have also experienced problems. The government scheme allows Â£15 a week for every child eligible for free school meals Edenred says it continues to make big improvements to its system and waiting times for schools and families to log on to the site have been ""almost eliminated"". More than Â£52m worth of eGift cards have been issued to schools and families since the scheme was launched, with 16,500 schools signed up, it adds. The Department for Education says it is encouraging schools to make their own arrangements and to use Edenred only when that is not possible. But many heads are worried about doing their own deals to provide food or vouchers, whether with local catering suppliers, direct with supermarkets or with other voucher specialists such as Wonde. They believe their only option is to use Edenred, as it is fully funded and, if their budgets are in surplus, they will not be able to claim back money they spend on alternatives. Indeed,guidance published by the DfE last month,externallimits the schools able to claim back additional expenditure incurred because of the lockdown to those unable to meet the cost out of existing resources.

"This video can not be played No quick return to normality, says Bank of England chief The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is heading towards its sharpest recession on record. The coronavirus impact would see the economy shrink 14% this year, based on the lockdown being relaxed in June. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank to illustrate the economic impact said Covid-19 was ""dramatically reducing jobs and incomes in the UK"". Bank governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC there would be no quick return to normality. He described the downturn as ""unprecedented"", and said consumers would remain cautious even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Mr Bailey said: ""Not all of the economic activity comes back. There's quite a sharp recovery. But we've also factored that people will be cautious of their own choice. ""They don't re-engage fully, and so it's really only until next summer that activity comes fully back."" Bailey: Coronavirus bounce back 'could be fast' EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workers' wages? UK-US trade talks will not be an easy ride Also on Thursday, policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. However, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on whether to inject more stimulus into the economy. Two of its nine members voted to increase the latest round of quantitative easing by Â£100bn to Â£300bn. The Bank's analysis, published on Thursday, was based on the assumption that social distancing measures are gradually phased out between June and September. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed the UK economy plunging into its first recession in more than a decade. The economy shrinks by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, followed by an unprecedented 25% decline in the three months to June. This would push the UK into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The Bank said the housing market had come to a standstill, while consumer spending had dropped by 30% in recent weeks. For the year as a whole, the economy is expected to contract by 14%. This would be the biggest annual decline on record, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data dating back to 1949. It would also be the sharpest annual contraction since 1706, according to reconstructed Bank of England data stretchingÂ back to the 18th Century. While UK growth is expected to rebound in 2021 to 15%, the size of the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-virus peak until the middle of next year. The UK government isexpected to start easing lockdown restrictions next week. The Bank stressed that the outlook for the economy was ""unusually uncertain"" at present and would depend on how households and businesses responded to the pandemic. It also assumes: The government's jobs retention scheme covering 80% of wages is phased out with the lockdown. Companies stop or scale back their operations for some time. Cautious consumers voluntarily maintain social distancing until mid-2021. Mr Bailey said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be ""relatively small"". The economy was likely to recover ""much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis,"" he said. He also praised the action by the government to support workers and businesses through wage subsidies, loans and grants. He said the success of these schemes and the Bank's own stimulus meant there would be ""limited scarring to the economy"". ""The furloughing scheme really does enable people to come back into the economyÂ more quickly so it's a much quicker recoveryÂ that we've seen in the past."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the hit to the economy this year was equivalent to Â£9,000 for every family in Britain. He said: ""Faced with this huge economic hit, both the Bank and the government have made the right call in taking bold action to protect firms and families as much as possible."" Average weekly earnings are expected to shrink by 2% this year, reflectingÂ the fall in wages for furloughed workers. The Bank said sharp increases in benefit claims were ""consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate"", which is expected to climb above 9% this year, from the current rate of 4%. Under the Bank's scenario, inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) falls to zero at the start of next year amid the sharp drop in energy prices.It is also expected to remain well below the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report said the Bank's scenario was consistent with a 16% drop in house prices. Latest figures published by UK finance show one in seven mortgage holders has taken a payment holiday due to the coronavirus. The Bank said the number of new mortgage deals on offer had halved in just over a month as banks focused on the deluge of payment holiday requests. This includes a huge contraction in deals for buyers with a deposit of less than 40% of the purchase price. The MPC also highlighted the stark drop in consumer spending. It said spending on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment had dropped to a fifth of their previous levels. Shopping at High Street retailers had dropped by 80%, while business confidence was described as ""severely depressed"". Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, described the Bank's scenario as ""optimistic"", particularly its assumption that unemployment would fall back to its pre-crisis low in two years. ""Exactly how the economy evolves will depend critically on how the government calibrates its policies and how they are unwound and tapered,"" he said. ""There is plenty that could go wrong."" The Bank of England itself has minimal staff, but they have applied themselves to try to work out what is happening in the economy. They are not sufficiently confident that the numbers they have run, the charts that they have published, constitute what they would call a ""forecast"". But they do give the clearest indication that we are in recession, after the sharpest, fastest economic contraction in the three-century history of the Bank looking at these things. Faster than the financial crisis, and the Great Depression, and the earlier 1920s depression just before, the only things which come close. ""It is unprecedented in the recent history of this institution,"" Governor Andrew Bailey told me. ""What it really means is that obviously the very sharp sort of downturn, a product of the situation we've been in since March, and the restrictions that are in place, affect economic activity very severely,"" A recession? ""Yes,"" he replied. Read Faisal's blog here. Islam: Bounce back could be fast, says Bank's Bailey EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workersâ wages?

The Nigerian-British musician was known for a witty, mature style that owed more to the old-school US rappers than the grittier street sounds of London.

His death was mourned by stars including Ghetts and Roots Manuva.

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

A skater outside the closed Amoeba Music store, a Hollywood landmark California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the unprecedented two-month lockdown of the state - which put approximately four million people out work - is lifting on some businesses. Starting on Friday, retail businesses will allow kerbside pickups. Manufacturing will also resume, provided that employees wear masks and stay six feet (two metres) apart. Businesses where staff and customers come into close contact - such as hair salons - have not yet been given the green light to open. Earlier this week, California became the first state to formally request a loan from the federal government to help with swelling jobless claims. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC About 20% of the US workforce - 33.3 million people - have filed for unemployment since mid-March. People from all sectors of society have been affected, including photographer Steve Becker, 62, who says: ""All of my business has been cancelled - I've had no work since February."" He focuses on corporate photography, but businesses have cancelled fundraisers and events, while school graduations have also been delayed. ""My work normally happens in the spring and fall - a lot of corporations don't have events over the summer, so I only have about seven months to make my income. I have some events scheduled for October, but it's not clear whether they're going to go ahead."" Still, he considers himself lucky. ""My partner works, and I'm very blessed I was able to do what I enjoy and make a good living out of it. It takes a lot of perseverance, and I miss going out and talking to people.""

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again. Willinger brewery in Hesse offered the beer to locals on Thursday. Dozens of people queued up while observing social distancing rules. Many took full buckets and boxes home with them. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that breweries across the country are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports. Bavaria's Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, has been cancelled. Shelley Luther refused to close her beauty salon The governor of Texas has amended his lockdown executive order to free a salon owner who was jailed after refusing to close down her business. Gov Greg Abbott's order bans ""confinement as a punishment"" for violating virus mitigation orders. Shelley Luther, the owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, was jailed for contempt of court on Tuesday after she refused to apologise and pay a fine for staying open despite official warnings.

England's Billy Vunipola, Alex Goode and Nick Isiekwe, Scotland back Sean Maitland and prop Josh Ibuanokpe were reportedly spotted in St Albans. The Daily Mail said the players met for a coffee and a chat in the street and did not follow social distancing rules. The Premiership season is currently suspended because of the pandemic. ""Management has spoken to the players involved, all of whom accept that they made an error in judgement,"" said a Saracens statement. ""The club has reminded these players as well as the whole Saracens squad of their responsibilities to themselves and the community around them and we are confident that this will not happen again.""

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say it was a ""brilliant show of support again for our heroic carers and all those on the front line"".

Earlier today, Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that a member of the US military who works at the White House had tested positive.

Shelley Luther, the owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, was jailed for contempt of court on Tuesday after she refused to apologise and pay a fine for staying open despite official warnings. Texas is nearing 1,000 Covid-19 deaths and 35,000 infections.

England's Billy Vunipola, Alex Goode and Nick Isiekwe, Scotland back Sean Maitland and prop Josh Ibuanokpe were reportedly spotted in St Albans. The Daily Mail said the players met for a coffee and a chat in the street and did not follow social distancing rules. The Premiership season is currently suspended because of the pandemic. ""Management has spoken to the players involved, all of whom accept that they made an error in judgement,"" said a Saracens statement. ""The club has reminded these players as well as the whole Saracens squad of their responsibilities to themselves and the community around them and we are confident that this will not happen again.""

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say it was a ""brilliant show of support again for our heroic carers and all those on the front line"". Residents clap in a street in Northampton People clap for carers on their balconies in London A woman claps in her garden in Cardiff Applause outside a hospital in Salford The president says he was tested on Wednesday and Thursday President Donald Trump has told reporters that coronavirus testing at the White House will be increased from once a week to once per day after an aide who works in close contact with Trump tested positive for the virus. âIâve had very little contact with this person,â he said in the White House Oval Office, adding that he had himself been tested on Wednesday and Thursday. Earlier today, Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that a member of the US military who works at the White House had tested positive. CNN reported that the infected person, who is in the US Navy, was a personal valet to Trump. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ian Grand is angry that he hasn't had the money back from the cancelled PGL trip his three children were looking forward to Angry parents are demanding their cash back from a specialist school holiday company. PGL hosts children at residential activity centres across the UK, but has had to cancel visits during the coronavirus lockdown. Parents are asking for their money back, but PGL - dubbed Parents Get Lost by children - has refused. Instead, the school holiday company is offering customers a ""refund credit note"". PGL runs short-stay school trips with outdoor activities for thousands of pupils each year at sites across the UK and in France. Like the rest of the travel industry, the coronavirus crisis has had a ""significant impact"" on its business. If the customer wants a cash refund, the refund credit note entitles them to obtain the money in March 2021, or they can use the credit note for booking a future holiday. Hard-up families say that's not good enough and if the situation were to be reversed, they would be unlikely to be able to defer paying for another 10 months. Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: Schools face losses for cancelled trips Coronavirus: 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Ian Grand of Worksop in Nottinghamshire booked a four-day break with PGL for his three children, plus his niece and nephew, for the end of May, at a cost of Â£1,583.75. After the company cancelled the holiday in March, the family asked for their money back, but six weeks later they're still waiting. ""They offered me a credit note but I wasn't keen as I was worried that should PGL go under, I would lose out,"" Mr Grand told the BBC. ""I asked for a refund, which the terms of the contract stated must be done within 14 days. ""My wife is a self-employed dividend director who has not been offered any support under the government schemes so the only income we can rely on is mine. So having the money from the cancelled booking would be a welcome relief."" Ian reckons that if the situation was reversed and the family had cancelled the holiday, the company would be chasing them for the cash. ""I am quite sure that PGL would refer to the terms and conditions - and rightly so - and we would have lost some or all of the money. Now I am referring to their terms and conditions to argue my point [that] PGL are moving the goal posts, or so it would seem."" Mum Stacey Edwards with children Gypsie-Dee, Cruize and Pixie-Fern Stacey Edwards is a full-time mum of four in Watchet in Somerset and with her husband working a 40-hour week, money is tight. ""My 11-year-old son was due to go on a school trip to France with PGL in mid-March,"" she said. ""Obviously the trip had to be cancelled, but it left lots of parents Â£380 out of pocket and we still don't know what's going on."" The family booked the trip for son Cruize through his school last year and paid for it in full in December. Ms Edwards feels it would be really helpful to have the money back, and other parents feel the same: ""PGL are not talking to parents as the trip was booked through the school, which has told us it has submitted a travel insurance claim. ""Lots of families locally are in the same boat, waiting to hear if they'll get their money back."" PGL - named after the firm's founder Peter Gordon Lawrence - has offered to reschedule trips and is offering a refund credit note to customers. The travel agents' group ABTA has asked the government to amend travel regulations in light of the coronavirus crisis. One proposal is to allow travel firms to issue refund credits as an acceptable and enforceable alternative to immediate cash refunds, and to extend the 14-day period holiday providers have to issue refunds until 31 March 2021. While awaiting clarity from the government on the issue, PGL told the BBC it is offering either flexible rebooking arrangements or a refund credit note, which can be claimed for a cash refund when it expires in March 2021, ""in line with ABTA guidance"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? A spokesman for PGL said: ""We have been waiting for ABTA to receive clarity from the government, which has not been forthcoming."" When it comes to trips organised by schools, the company said it is supporting schools whose trips have been impacted - those who were scheduled to travel before 31 May to make insurance claims. ""This has been acknowledged by the government, the ABI (Association of British Insurers) and various trade and professional and other organisational bodies within the school travel sector, as the best method to secure cash to refund parents,"" said PGL. Many travel firms have adopted a similar policy, but Which? Travel editor Rory Boland reckons that's not good enough. ""It's true that the travel industry is under enormous strain at the moment but they're not the only ones in difficult circumstances,"" he pointed out. ""Lots of people are struggling with money and it's unfair of travel firms to effectively ask them for an interest-free loan."" He added that it should not be up to consumers to bail-out struggling firms: ""The bailout should come from the government."" An ABI spokesperson responded:  ""Where travel operators have a legal obligation to refund customers, insurers expect them to honour that legal agreement. ""Insurance cancellation cover kicks in when no other safety net is available with insurers expecting to pay out Â£275m in cancellation costs due to Covid-19.""

"Roadside families have been without water and sanitation after public services shut Travellers have told the BBC the coronavirus pandemic has left them struggling for weeks without access to water, electricity or sanitation. Some have received eviction threats while one pregnant woman said the hardship was severely affecting her mental health. A national charity supporting the community said calls to its helpline had doubled. The government said it has written to councils about providing services. Around 10,000 Gypsies and travellers currently live roadside on unauthorised encampments while around 70,000 reside on sites, according to charities. Some Irish Travellers asked to be anonymous because of fears about public abuse. Charlene, not her real name, is in her early 20s and pregnant. She lives with her husband's family on an overcrowded council-run site in London with a single, shared amenity block. She told the BBC she has had no separate access to running water to help her self-isolate, or any electricity during the lockdown. ""I'm about to be a mum for the first time and feel very vulnerable. ""My anxiety and depression couldn't be higher... I'm feeling let down and at risk of infection."" Josie, also not her real name, is living roadside with her family, including 18 young children, in caravans in London. She said they have had no access to electricity, running water or toilets for more than six weeks. They had been relying on public amenities and local facilities such as leisure centres, but these have all temporarily closed. ""Why are travellers forgotten about at times like this?"" she asks. ""We are human beings."" Debby Kennett, head of London Gypsies and Travellers, an organisation which challenges social exclusion and discrimination, said vulnerable families had been given ""no support"" by local councils. Chloe has been stopped by police four times since the lockdown started and threatened with fines Chloe, 32, from Scarborough, lives in a van with her eight-year-old daughter and has been asked to relocate four times by police in the last month. ""I've been constantly on edge, stopped at all hours of the night and my mental health has really suffered,"" she said. She is employed on the frontline as a community support worker aiding the rehabilitation of hospital patients, many of whom are recovering from coronavirus. ""I've been made to feel like an outcast from the community where I've lived all my life and paid my taxes,"" she said. She said her local council suggested she either leave the town or register as homeless to stay in a bed and breakfast, but Chloe said no children or pets were allowed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Chris Johnson, partner at Community Law Partnership in Birmingham, said he had halted three council evictions of travellers since the start of the lockdown. ""The current government guidance implies councils should not evict people but help them find alternative locations,"" he said. Janette McCormick, the deputy chief constable at the National Police Chiefs' Council, said a large number of travellers have health issues and authorities should respond ""proportionately"". In a letter sent to all police Chief Officers, seen by BBC News, she has encouraged forces to stop evictions in favour of ""negotiated stopping"". This involves councils making agreements with travellers to temporarily settle on unauthorised sites in return for better access to healthcare and public services. Sarah Sweeney from Friends, Families and Travellers said urgent support was needed Sarah Sweeney, policy manager at Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) in Brighton, said calls to its national helpline had doubled during the crisis and there had been threats of eviction in nearly a dozen local authorities. ""We have also heard a number of issues where vulnerable people have struggled to register at GPs or contact NHS 111 because they don't have fixed addresses,"" she said. The charity has been supporting the community with food packages, practical advice, and help accessing remote schooling and relief funds. ""Many people living roadside would like to live on a site or land, but it's really difficult because there's been a chronic under delivery of traveller sites across the country,"" she explained. FFT has written to the government asking for specific guidance in England to support the community. Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have already acted. The government said Public Health England was working to develop guidance for travellers and it had written to councils to underline their  responsibility to provide water, sanitation and waste disposal facilities. ""Councils are also best placed to decide when to use their powers to remove unauthorised encampments in order to ensure that the rights of settled communities are respected and the local environment protected,"" it added. A spokesperson for City Hall said the mayor was aware of the ""acute health inequalities"" that the Gypsy and traveller community faces and it was ""vital"" that they are able to self-isolate. It said it would not move on any unauthorised encampments of travellers without ""fully considering"" the circumstances and nature of the encampment.

"Most health visitors checks are being carried out remotely at the moment Concerns for the wellbeing of babies born in lockdown are being raised, as parents struggle to access regular support services. England's children's commissioner is highlighting pressures facing mothers caring for babies without the usual family and state support networks. Playgroups are closed and health visitor ""visits"" are being carried out remotely in most cases. The NHS said adaptations had been made to keep new mothers and babies safe. The briefing paper from Anne Longfield's office says an estimated 76,000 babies will have been born in England under lockdown so far. But births are not being registered, because of temporary rules tied to the virus pandemic, so even basic information about new babies is not being gathered. At the same time, support services provided by health visitors and GPs are not readily accessible, with many taking place via phone and video calls or not at all. She highlights how up to 50% of health visitors in some areas of England were redeployed to other parts of the NHS as it grappled to fight the pandemic. And there are concerns many babies may have missed their developmental health checks, due in the first few weeks of life to pick up urgent developmental needs. Institute of Health Visiting executive director Dr Cheryll Adams said health visitors were very concerned. ""In some areas, the six-week GP baby check hasn't been available or parents haven't wanted to attend it due to a potential risk of infection,"" she said. And, although helplines for parents had been set up in most areas, the usual sources of support from family, friends and voluntary services were no longer as available. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms Longfield said: ""At the best of times, around 10% of new mothers face perinatal [post-birth] mental illness - but the GP is closed, as is the children's centre and playgroups and playgrounds, and the health visitor, where she 'visits', is doing so by video link. ""There are even reports that in some areas families have been stopped from playing outside together by heavy-handed policing of lockdown rules. ""The vast majority of new parents will be coping - the resilience of the family will see them through. ""But there will be a significant minority where the additional challenge of a new child is a strain too far."" Ms Longfield is particularly concerned about children living in poverty or with risks such as domestic violence or mental ill health. ""Health services are usually the places where concerns about babies are identified and referred - and these services are likely to remain under increased pressure for a long period of time,"" she said. Proactive steps were needed to ensure different agencies shared information on children they had concerns about, she said. And she called for ministers and local authorities to prepare for a surge in referrals to social services and post-natal services as lockdown eased. Public Health England chief nurse Prof Viv Bennett said: ""Many community nursing services have been provided virtually and innovatively during the Covid-19 response. ""With the onset of Covid-19, some public health nurses were redeployed in hospitals where their expertise was most needed to care for acutely ill patients. ""It is important that as pressures ease, these nurses are able to quickly get back to help support those families and young people.""

"Zara Radcliffe is accused of murdering 88-year-old John Rees A woman has appeared in court charged with murdering an 88-year-old man who was stabbed to death at a supermarket in south Wales. John Rees was fatally injured at the Co-op, in Penygraig, Rhondda, at about 13:45 BST on Tuesday. Zara Anne Radcliffe, 29, from Porth, only spoke to confirm her name and address before Cardiff magistrates. She is also accused of the attempted murder of Lisa Way, Gaynor Saurin and Andrew Price. Mr Price is said to be in a stable condition at the University Hospital of Wales, while the two women sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Mr Rees, a grandfather from Trealaw, has been described by his family as ""the very definition of a good man, extremely respected and liked in the community"". In a statement, his relatives added: ""He was proud of his family, proud to be a Welshman and devoted to All Saints Church. We will all miss him terribly."" Three other people were injured at the Co-op store on Tylacelyn Road in Penygraig The Church in Wales has confirmed that bells, which had been rung in previous weeks by Mr Rees in honour of key workers will ring again at All Saints Church on Thursday evening. Mr Rees, a longstanding member of the church community along with his wife Eunice, had served on the Parochial Church Council at the church in Trealaw. The Church in Wales said a memorial service could take place at the church when it reopens, if the family request one. Flowers and tributes have been left at All Saints Church Trealaw councillor Joy Rosser said she would be out clapping for Mr Rees later, when the church bells are ringing: ""John was a very private person, he was a true gentleman and a committed family man devoted to his wife Eunice for whom he was carer. ""My heart goes out to his wife and family, he was an avid church-goer and was one of those who rang the bells for the NHS on Thursday evenings. ""I know I represent the views of the community in saying that prayers and thoughts are with the family and indeed all those who are affected by this tragic incident."" The two women injured in the incident have now both returned home following treatment. Gaynor Saurin is now recovering at home Jodie Pope, the daughter of Royal Glamorgan Hospital nurse Lisa Way, said on social media: ""Mam is home and we all feel very blessed and lucky that she is. ""Lisa Way is loved by so many. She is an inspirational hero with so much bravery and strength and we all as a family are incredibly proud of her! ""Our thoughts are with the family who have not been as lucky as us."" Ms Radcliffe was remanded in custody and will appear before Cardiff Crown Court on Monday. South Wales Police initially referred their handling of the case to the watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct. An IOPC spokesman said: ""We have decided that an investigation by the IOPC is not required, and the referral has been returned to the force.""

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures.

Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again. Willinger brewery in Hesse offered the beer to locals on Thursday. Dozens of people queued up while observing social distancing rules. Many took full buckets and boxes home with them. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that breweries across the country are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports. Bavaria's Oktoberfest, the world's biggest beer festival, has been cancelled. Shelley Luther refused to close her beauty salon The governor of Texas has amended his lockdown executive order to free a salon owner who was jailed after refusing to close down her business. Gov Greg Abbott's order bans ""confinement as a punishment"" for violating virus mitigation orders. Shelley Luther, the owner of Salon Ã  la Mode in Dallas, was jailed for contempt of court on Tuesday after she refused to apologise and pay a fine for staying open despite official warnings. Texas is nearing 1,000 Covid-19 deaths and 35,000 infections.

England's Billy Vunipola, Alex Goode and Nick Isiekwe, Scotland back Sean Maitland and prop Josh Ibuanokpe were reportedly spotted in St Albans. The Daily Mail said the players met for a coffee and a chat in the street and did not follow social distancing rules. The Premiership season is currently suspended because of the pandemic. ""Management has spoken to the players involved, all of whom accept that they made an error in judgement,"" said a Saracens statement. ""The club has reminded these players as well as the whole Saracens squad of their responsibilities to themselves and the community around them and we are confident that this will not happen again.""

The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The report was meant to be published on Friday, but now the guidance ""will never see the light of day,"" a CDC official told the AP. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak, rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"". Trump has promised a report on what role the institute played in the global outbreak. China has denied the theory. Read more here:Is there any evidence for lab release theory? Francehas reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, down from 278 on Wednesday, meaning 25,987 people have died with the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. 
   The figures come as the prime minister announced lockdown measures wouldremain in Paris and the north east, but ease elsewhere. Fatalities inItalyalso fell compared with Wednesday -  274 people died. The number of new infections also fell, but only by 43, to 1,401. The country's death toll stands at 29,958, the third highest
in the world after the United States and the UK. InSpain, 213 people died, down from 244 the previous
day. Spain's parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency to control people's movements for two more weeks. More than 26,000 people have died. And inPoland, which has one of the lowest death rates in the EU, 324 new infections were recorded and 22 virus-related deaths, taking the total number of victims to 755. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $3bn (Â£1.7bn) fund that will boost the pay of frontline workers during the pandemic. ""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving
and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a
daily briefing on Thursday. The money will be shared among provinces who will determine who exactly will receive the money. Trudeau said essential staff, often in minimum wage jobs, deserved a pay rise. Some provinces have already taken action. Saskatchewan is topping up the monthly wages of those working with vulnerable people, while Ontario is boosting salaries by three dollars an hour. More pictures are coming in now of people all over the UK clapping for NHS staff and other key workers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say it was a ""brilliant show of support again for our heroic carers and all those on the front line"".

Earlier today, Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley confirmed that a member of the US military who works at the White House had tested positive. CNN reported that the infected person, who is in the US Navy, was a personal valet to Trump. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes At least 11 people have been killed by a massive gas leak at a chemical plant in southern India, with 800 others taken to hospital. The leak from the LG Polymers plant in the city of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state came as people slept. Doctors say patients have been complaining of a burning sensation in the eyes and difficulties breathing. Areas around the plant have been evacuated. The leak may have been due to negligence, officials say. Reports suggest initial attempts to control the gas leak were unsuccessful but the company and state officials say the situation is now under control. LG said in a statement it was investigating the cause of the incident, and was looking at ways ""to provide speedy treatment"" for those affected. Rajendra Reddy, a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, told the BBC that the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called an emergency disaster meeting. The leak took place at around 03:00 local time (21:30 GMT Wednesday) as the plant was being re-opened for the first time since 24 March, when India went into lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""All those who have been hospitalised are currently stable,"" BK Naik, a local health official, told Reuters news agency. Doctors say 86 patients are being treated on ventilators, but many injured have been discharged. Legal action is being taken against the company, says state Industries Minister Goutam Reddy. Earlier, he told BBC Telugu that it looked as though proper procedures and guidelines were not followed when the South Korean-owned plant was being re-opened. ""We would like the company to proactively respond to the incident and ensure that the same level of responsibility is taken if this incident were to happen in EU or United States,"" he said, adding that the incident had been reported to the Korean embassy. Hundreds have taken ill after the gas leak at a polymer factory Swaroop Rani, a senior police official in Visakhapatnam, told AFP that the plant had been left idle because of the lockdown. ""[The gas] was left there because of the lockdown. It led to a chemical reaction and heat was produced inside the tanks, and the gas leaked because of that."" Local villagers complained around 03:30 and police immediately went to the scene, but had to quickly retreat for fear of being poisoned, the news agency quoted her as saying. ""One could feel the gas in the air and it was not possible for any of us to stay there for more than a few minutes,"" she said. As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes in panic. Distressing images of people fainting and dropping unconscious on the streets are being shared on social media. ""My eyes were itchy, and I was feeling drowsy, light-headed and slightly breathless,"" Yashwanth Saikumar Ambati, who lives about 300 metres from the plant, told Reuters. Officials said the fumes had spread over a radius of about 3km (2 miles) and people from surrounding areas were evacuated. Although a large number have been admitted to hospital, most should be able to make a recovery, they added. Vijay Gajam, BBC News Telugu A loud banging on the front door woke me up at 03:30. My wife and I rushed to the door, and found our neighbours outside, looking agitated. ""There has been an explosion at Polymers! Leave immediately,"" they told us. I could see people running on the road outside. I spotted my landlord, who also asked me to leave the house as soon as I could. Just then, I began to smell something pungent in the air. We quickly understood what had happened. The smell became stronger and my eyes began to burn. My wife, son and I left the house on my motorbike. As we drove down the street, we saw hundreds of people were fleeing their homes. We kept going until we reached Kailasagiri beach, about 20km away. We only stopped when we couldn't smell the gas any more. Earlier in the day, district health official Dr Naik said many people were feared to be unconscious in their homes. ""There are people who were sleeping,"" AFP quoted him as saying. ""We are working to get people to the hospital. They need oxygenation and fresh air. ""We are trying to understand the long-term impact of the chemical on those who have inhaled it during the leak."" Officials said the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated In the meantime, officials have asked people to protect themselves by covering their faces with a wet cloth. The Indian navy has been helping supply oxygen to patients. India has a tragic history of gas leaks. In 1984, a toxic chemical leak in a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal killed thousands of people, in what is acknowledged to be the world's worst industrial disaster. More than 35 years later, victims say children are still being born with disabilities because of the effects of the methyl isocyanate gas spill. Reporting by BBC Telugu's Satish Balla and Deepthi Bathini Styrene is a colourless, or light yellow, flammable liquid primarily used in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins - it is used in the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs, packaging, synthetic marble, flooring, disposable tableware and moulded furniture Breathing air contaminated with styrene vapours can cause irritation of the nose and throat, coughing and wheezing, and create a build-up of fluid in the lungs Exposure to larger amounts can result in the onset of ""styrene sickness"", the signs and symptoms of which include headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, tiredness, dizziness, confusion and clumsy or unsteady motion (known collectively as central nervous system depression) In some cases exposure to styrene can also result in irregular heartbeats and even coma Several epidemiologic studies suggest there may be an association between styrene exposure and an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma though the evidence is inconclusive Sources: The PHE Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards and US Environment Protection Agency Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"This video can not be played Any lockdown changes will be ""modest"", says Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The PM says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution"" when considering easing coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson is due to announce plans for England's lockdown on Sunday, but ministers have insisted short term changes to measures will be ""modest"". At the government's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described media reports on easing restrictions as ""not a reliable guide"". He added that changes may vary between the different nations. It comes after Scotland's lockdownwas formally extendedand the Northern Ireland Executive said there was""no headroom"" yet to ease the lockdown. Wales is due to announced itsthe nation's lockdown plans on Friday, after the Welsh government warned media reports speculating how Mr Johnson might ease lockdown measuresrisked sending ""mixed messages""to the public. Some newspapers suggested the rules on exercise could be relaxed and more people encouraged to return to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations - and could lift restrictions at a different rate. Mixed messages across the four nations Is it time to free healthy people from restrictions? What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown The prime minister has told leaders of the devolved nations that he is committed to a UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus ""even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds"", Downing Street said. ""Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation,"" a No 10 spokesman added. The latest figures show the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. The UK provided some 86,583 tests in 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Thursday - meaning the government missed its 100,000-per-day target for the fifth consecutive day. There were reports restrictions on outdoor exercise could be lifted in England from Monday People all over the UK joined in the weekly clap for NHS staff and other key workers on Thursday evening At the briefing, Mr Raab said any short term changes to restrictions would be ""modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored"". He stressed that the existing rules would still apply over the bank holiday weekend and urged people to ""continue to follow the guidance"". Facing pressure over media reports suggesting the lockdown would be eased, the foreign secretary said that reports were ""not a reliable guide"" to future policy decisions. Coronavirus: Is R the crucial number? He added that future decisions would be based on the reproduction number - known as the R level - which represents the average number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to. ""If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren't following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place,"" he said. Mr Raab said the R number was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. However, Prof John Edmunds, who is advising the government, said earlier that it had actually risen slightly - to between 0.75 and one. An R number greater than one would result in exponential growth in the number of cases. But if the number stays lower than one, the disease will eventually peter out as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Sir Ian Diamond, the chief statistician for the Office for National Statistics, saidthe current R numberwas below one. However, he said R had increased since the last estimates due to the rise in virus transmission in care homes. The R number can be different in different parts of the country or in different settings, says the BBC's health reporter Rachel Schraer. ""The question is how contained they are or whether the epidemic in care homes will spread back into the community,"" she said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""right to extend the lockdown"" until the infection rate was under control, saying that ""the health and safety of the nation needs to come first"". He added that ""there needs to be absolute clarity that we must follow the rules"". With much speculation about Sunday's announcement, the government seems keen to manage expectations. Dominic Raab's emphasis was on gradual steps; he spoke of this being a delicate and dangerous moment with the virus remaining deadly. He said the prime minister would set out a road map of how the country might come out of this lockdown, but the government doesn't want to release the handbrake and see the car race away just yet. Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon said she would prefer the UK to make changes as a whole, but said the four nations could decide in a ""grown-up"" manner if they ""want to go different ways"". She added that media reports about the prime minister planning to ease the lockdown had not been discussed with the Scottish government. Earlier, a Welsh government spokesman said it was ""crucially important"" people in Wales were ""informed clearly and accurately"" about any changes to the current restrictions. ""Some of the reporting in today's newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK,"" he added. It comes as the UKbecame the first country in Europeto record more than 30,000 people dying with coronavirus. It has been just over nine weeks since the UK recorded its first death on 2 March. The personal stories of those who have died are continuing to emerge. Among those was Dr Tariq Shafi, 61,who was the lead consultant for haematology for 13 years at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent. Dr Tariq Shaf was described as a ""dedicated and respected"" doctor In other developments: The Bank of England has warned that the pandemicwill push the UK economy towards its deepest recession on record Black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus as white people in England and Wales,according to the Office for National Statistics The UK has said 400,000 surgicalgowns ordered from Turkey do not meet British safety standards Notting Hill Carnival has been cancelled, with organisers saying this was ""the only safe option"" amid the pandemic People have been warned to avoid beauty spots this bank holiday weekend,as temperatures are predicted to soar across England British Airways owner IAG has said it is planning for a ""meaningful return"" of flightsin July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed People across the UKjoined Clap for Carers for the seventh week in a row How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Black men and women arenearly twice as likely to die with coronavirusas white people in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The analysis shows the inequality persists after taking into account age, where people live and some measures of deprivation and prior health. People from Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities also had a significantly higher risk of dying. The government has started a review into the issue. The analysis by the ONS combined data on deaths involving Covid-19 with information on ethnicity from the 2011 census. Taking into account age, location and some measures of deprivation, disadvantage and prior health, it found black people were 90% more likely to die with Covid-19 than white people. An image ofFlorence Nightingalewill be projected on to
St Thomas' and Guy's hospitals, as well as a hospital Rome, to mark 200 years since her birth and to also give thanks to all healthcare workers. The 15m x 10m image 



will be shown between 20:00 and 23:00 BST on Monday and Tuesday next week on the two hospitals, as well as on Romeâs L. Spallanzani hospital. It has been organised by the Florence
Nightingale Museum and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust. Dame Eileen Sills, Chief Nurse at Guyâs and St
Thomasâ NHS Foundation Trust, said it was ""a very fitting tribute
as her first nursing school was set up at St Thomas' Hospital in 1860,
establishing Guy's and St Thomas' as the home of modern nursing"". David Green, director of the Florence Nightingale
Museum, said the famous nurseâs
teachings were ""more important than ever before"". ""Her emphasis on good sanitation,
hygiene and gathering data is still the foundation of modern nursing and is a
key part of the global efforts to tackle coronavirus,"" he said. Towns and cities around England had planned parades and street parties to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE Day.

The early May bank holiday was moved so that people could celebrate, with many towns planning public events. Many of those have been cancelled, but people are finding alternative ways to mark the occasion. Take a look at some of the preparations people have been making around England. City councils inBirminghamandLeedshave announced plans to widen pavements on some busy streets to help with social distancing when coronavirus restrictions begin to ease. Birmingham City Council has said it will also remove on-street parking on the high streets in Erdington and Kings Heath, with those areas identified as among the city's busiest streets with the highest levels of pedestrian activity. The council said the two streets were ""just the start"" and further measures would be announced later. Meanwhile, pavements on Mill Hill, Call Lane, New York Street, Upper Briggate, St Paul's Street and Great George Street in Leeds city centre will be altered. On The Headrow, a 4m-wide pathway will be created for people to safely pass the construction works and a temporary segregated cycle lane is also being introduced on the A65 road. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Roadside families have been without water and sanitation after public services shut Travellers have told the BBC the coronavirus pandemic has left them struggling for weeks without access to water, electricity or sanitation. Some have received eviction threats while one pregnant woman said the hardship was severely affecting her mental health. A national charity supporting the community said calls to its helpline had doubled. The government said it has written to councils about providing services. Around 10,000 Gypsies and travellers currently live roadside on unauthorised encampments while around 70,000 reside on sites, according to charities. Some Irish Travellers asked to be anonymous because of fears about public abuse. Charlene, not her real name, is in her early 20s and pregnant. She lives with her husband's family on an overcrowded council-run site in London with a single, shared amenity block. She told the BBC she has had no separate access to running water to help her self-isolate, or any electricity during the lockdown. ""I'm about to be a mum for the first time and feel very vulnerable. ""My anxiety and depression couldn't be higher... I'm feeling let down and at risk of infection."" Josie, also not her real name, is living roadside with her family, including 18 young children, in caravans in London. She said they have had no access to electricity, running water or toilets for more than six weeks. They had been relying on public amenities and local facilities such as leisure centres, but these have all temporarily closed. ""Why are travellers forgotten about at times like this?"" she asks. ""We are human beings."" Debby Kennett, head of London Gypsies and Travellers, an organisation which challenges social exclusion and discrimination, said vulnerable families had been given ""no support"" by local councils. Chloe has been stopped by police four times since the lockdown started and threatened with fines Chloe, 32, from Scarborough, lives in a van with her eight-year-old daughter and has been asked to relocate four times by police in the last month. ""I've been constantly on edge, stopped at all hours of the night and my mental health has really suffered,"" she said. She is employed on the frontline as a community support worker aiding the rehabilitation of hospital patients, many of whom are recovering from coronavirus. ""I've been made to feel like an outcast from the community where I've lived all my life and paid my taxes,"" she said. She said her local council suggested she either leave the town or register as homeless to stay in a bed and breakfast, but Chloe said no children or pets were allowed. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Chris Johnson, partner at Community Law Partnership in Birmingham, said he had halted three council evictions of travellers since the start of the lockdown. ""The current government guidance implies councils should not evict people but help them find alternative locations,"" he said. Janette McCormick, the deputy chief constable at the National Police Chiefs' Council, said a large number of travellers have health issues and authorities should respond ""proportionately"". In a letter sent to all police Chief Officers, seen by BBC News, she has encouraged forces to stop evictions in favour of ""negotiated stopping"". This involves councils making agreements with travellers to temporarily settle on unauthorised sites in return for better access to healthcare and public services. Sarah Sweeney from Friends, Families and Travellers said urgent support was needed Sarah Sweeney, policy manager at Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) in Brighton, said calls to its national helpline had doubled during the crisis and there had been threats of eviction in nearly a dozen local authorities. ""We have also heard a number of issues where vulnerable people have struggled to register at GPs or contact NHS 111 because they don't have fixed addresses,"" she said. The charity has been supporting the community with food packages, practical advice, and help accessing remote schooling and relief funds. ""Many people living roadside would like to live on a site or land, but it's really difficult because there's been a chronic under delivery of traveller sites across the country,"" she explained. FFT has written to the government asking for specific guidance in England to support the community. Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland have already acted. The government said Public Health England was working to develop guidance for travellers and it had written to councils to underline their  responsibility to provide water, sanitation and waste disposal facilities. ""Councils are also best placed to decide when to use their powers to remove unauthorised encampments in order to ensure that the rights of settled communities are respected and the local environment protected,"" it added. A spokesperson for City Hall said the mayor was aware of the ""acute health inequalities"" that the Gypsy and traveller community faces and it was ""vital"" that they are able to self-isolate. It said it would not move on any unauthorised encampments of travellers without ""fully considering"" the circumstances and nature of the encampment.

"This video can not be played No quick return to normality, says Bank of England chief The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy is heading towards its sharpest recession on record. The coronavirus impact would see the economy shrink 14% this year, based on the lockdown being relaxed in June. Scenarios drawn up by the Bank to illustrate the economic impact said Covid-19 was ""dramatically reducing jobs and incomes in the UK"". Bank governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC there would be no quick return to normality. He described the downturn as ""unprecedented"", and said consumers would remain cautious even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Mr Bailey said: ""Not all of the economic activity comes back. There's quite a sharp recovery. But we've also factored that people will be cautious of their own choice. ""They don't re-engage fully, and so it's really only until next summer that activity comes fully back."" Bailey: Coronavirus bounce back 'could be fast' EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workers' wages? UK-US trade talks will not be an easy ride Also on Thursday, policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. However, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on whether to inject more stimulus into the economy. Two of its nine members voted to increase the latest round of quantitative easing by Â£100bn to Â£300bn. The Bank's analysis, published on Thursday, was based on the assumption that social distancing measures are gradually phased out between June and September. Its latestMonetary Policy Report,externalshowed the UK economy plunging into its first recession in more than a decade. The economy shrinks by 3% in the first quarter of 2020, followed by an unprecedented 25% decline in the three months to June. This would push the UK into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The Bank said the housing market had come to a standstill, while consumer spending had dropped by 30% in recent weeks. For the year as a whole, the economy is expected to contract by 14%. This would be the biggest annual decline on record, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data dating back to 1949. It would also be the sharpest annual contraction since 1706, according to reconstructed Bank of England data stretchingÂ back to the 18th Century. While UK growth is expected to rebound in 2021 to 15%, the size of the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-virus peak until the middle of next year. The UK government isexpected to start easing lockdown restrictions next week. The Bank stressed that the outlook for the economy was ""unusually uncertain"" at present and would depend on how households and businesses responded to the pandemic. It also assumes: The government's jobs retention scheme covering 80% of wages is phased out with the lockdown. Companies stop or scale back their operations for some time. Cautious consumers voluntarily maintain social distancing until mid-2021. Mr Bailey said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be ""relatively small"". The economy was likely to recover ""much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis,"" he said. He also praised the action by the government to support workers and businesses through wage subsidies, loans and grants. He said the success of these schemes and the Bank's own stimulus meant there would be ""limited scarring to the economy"". ""The furloughing scheme really does enable people to come back into the economyÂ more quickly so it's a much quicker recoveryÂ that we've seen in the past."" James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the hit to the economy this year was equivalent to Â£9,000 for every family in Britain. He said: ""Faced with this huge economic hit, both the Bank and the government have made the right call in taking bold action to protect firms and families as much as possible."" Average weekly earnings are expected to shrink by 2% this year, reflectingÂ the fall in wages for furloughed workers. The Bank said sharp increases in benefit claims were ""consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate"", which is expected to climb above 9% this year, from the current rate of 4%. Under the Bank's scenario, inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) falls to zero at the start of next year amid the sharp drop in energy prices.It is also expected to remain well below the Bank's 2% target for the next two years. The Bank's latest Financial Stability Report said the Bank's scenario was consistent with a 16% drop in house prices. Latest figures published by UK finance show one in seven mortgage holders has taken a payment holiday due to the coronavirus. The Bank said the number of new mortgage deals on offer had halved in just over a month as banks focused on the deluge of payment holiday requests. This includes a huge contraction in deals for buyers with a deposit of less than 40% of the purchase price. The MPC also highlighted the stark drop in consumer spending. It said spending on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment had dropped to a fifth of their previous levels. Shopping at High Street retailers had dropped by 80%, while business confidence was described as ""severely depressed"". Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, described the Bank's scenario as ""optimistic"", particularly its assumption that unemployment would fall back to its pre-crisis low in two years. ""Exactly how the economy evolves will depend critically on how the government calibrates its policies and how they are unwound and tapered,"" he said. ""There is plenty that could go wrong."" The Bank of England itself has minimal staff, but they have applied themselves to try to work out what is happening in the economy. They are not sufficiently confident that the numbers they have run, the charts that they have published, constitute what they would call a ""forecast"". But they do give the clearest indication that we are in recession, after the sharpest, fastest economic contraction in the three-century history of the Bank looking at these things. Faster than the financial crisis, and the Great Depression, and the earlier 1920s depression just before, the only things which come close. ""It is unprecedented in the recent history of this institution,"" Governor Andrew Bailey told me. ""What it really means is that obviously the very sharp sort of downturn, a product of the situation we've been in since March, and the restrictions that are in place, affect economic activity very severely,"" A recession? ""Yes,"" he replied. Read Faisal's blog here. Islam: Bounce back could be fast, says Bank's Bailey EU facing 'deep and uneven recession' Will the government keep paying workersâ wages?

"Mobile operator O2 and broadband giant Virgin Media are to merge, creating one of the UK's largest entertainment and telecoms firms and a major rival to BT. Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, and Spain's Telefonica, which owns O2, said they had agreed terms for joining forces. Consumer group Which? called on the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the deal. It said the tie-up ""could have a significant impact on consumers"". Which? added: ""Neither provider stands out in our recent customer satisfaction surveys, and any merger should only be allowed to go ahead if it delivers positive outcomes for consumers."" O2 has about 34 million mobile phone users, while Virgin has about six million broadband and cable TV customers and another three million mobile users. As well as having its own subscribers, O2 provides the network for Tesco Mobile, Giffgaff and Sky Mobile. Telefonica chief executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said: ""Combining O2's number one mobile business with Virgin Media's superfast broadband network and entertainment services will be a game-changer in the UK, at a time when demand for connectivity has never been greater or more critical."" Despite Which?'s concerns about the deal, some analysts said customers were set to benefit by having access to more services, although it is unclear whether cost savings from the tie-up will be passed on to consumers. Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at price comparison website Uswitch.com, said he did not expect customers to lose out. ""It will be interesting to see what this means for existing customers in terms of products and access to extra services, such as O2 Priorities. ""For all customers there is the exciting prospect of greater breadth of entertainment and faster speeds to look forward to."" Karen Egan, telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis, told the BBC's Today programme the deal was ""a fortuitous marrying of objectives"" for the two parent companies. Telefonica was ""keen to monetise"" its stake in O2, while Liberty Global had long believed in combining fixed-line and mobile networks, she said. The new merged company would now be able to ""diversify and match some of BT's innovative products"", she added. Virgin Media and O2 are celebrating the creation of a powerful competitor to BT as a converged communications business. They appear confident that their merger will be waved through by the competition regulator - but that assumes the deal is self-evidently good for consumers. Will removing one player from the telecoms market really mean better prices and improved service for Virgin and O2 customers? The firms are insisting that it will give them the resources for the huge job of extending full fibre broadband and 5G across the UK, promising to spend Â£10bn over the next five years.  But the consumer group Which? isn't convinced, pointing to the patchy customer service record of both firms and calling for an inquiry. Having allowed a merger between BT and EE in 2016, it seems unlikely that the Competition and Markets Authority will block this deal. But Virgin O2 - or whatever brand they choose - can still expect plenty of regulatory scrutiny, even after their marriage is approved. The companies said O2 would be valued at Â£12.7bn and Virgin Media at Â£18.7bn, both on a total enterprise value basis. ""O2 [is] to be transferred into the joint venture on a debt-free basis, while Virgin Media to be contributed with Â£11.3bn of net debt and debt-like items,"" the firms said in a joint statement. Telefonica tried to sell O2 to the owner of Three, CK Hutchison, for Â£10.3bn in 2015. However, thatdeal was blockedby the European Commission over concerns that it would have left just three major mobile phone operators in the UK.

"Zara Radcliffe is accused of murdering 88-year-old John Rees A woman has appeared in court charged with murdering an 88-year-old man who was stabbed to death at a supermarket in south Wales. John Rees was fatally injured at the Co-op, in Penygraig, Rhondda, at about 13:45 BST on Tuesday. Zara Anne Radcliffe, 29, from Porth, only spoke to confirm her name and address before Cardiff magistrates. She is also accused of the attempted murder of Lisa Way, Gaynor Saurin and Andrew Price. Mr Price is said to be in a stable condition at the University Hospital of Wales, while the two women sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Mr Rees, a grandfather from Trealaw, has been described by his family as ""the very definition of a good man, extremely respected and liked in the community"". In a statement, his relatives added: ""He was proud of his family, proud to be a Welshman and devoted to All Saints Church. We will all miss him terribly."" Three other people were injured at the Co-op store on Tylacelyn Road in Penygraig The Church in Wales has confirmed that bells, which had been rung in previous weeks by Mr Rees in honour of key workers will ring again at All Saints Church on Thursday evening. Mr Rees, a longstanding member of the church community along with his wife Eunice, had served on the Parochial Church Council at the church in Trealaw. The Church in Wales said a memorial service could take place at the church when it reopens, if the family request one. Flowers and tributes have been left at All Saints Church Trealaw councillor Joy Rosser said she would be out clapping for Mr Rees later, when the church bells are ringing: ""John was a very private person, he was a true gentleman and a committed family man devoted to his wife Eunice for whom he was carer. ""My heart goes out to his wife and family, he was an avid church-goer and was one of those who rang the bells for the NHS on Thursday evenings. ""I know I represent the views of the community in saying that prayers and thoughts are with the family and indeed all those who are affected by this tragic incident."" The two women injured in the incident have now both returned home following treatment. Gaynor Saurin is now recovering at home Jodie Pope, the daughter of Royal Glamorgan Hospital nurse Lisa Way, said on social media: ""Mam is home and we all feel very blessed and lucky that she is. ""Lisa Way is loved by so many. She is an inspirational hero with so much bravery and strength and we all as a family are incredibly proud of her! ""Our thoughts are with the family who have not been as lucky as us."" Ms Radcliffe was remanded in custody and will appear before Cardiff Crown Court on Monday. South Wales Police initially referred their handling of the case to the watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct. An IOPC spokesman said: ""We have decided that an investigation by the IOPC is not required, and the referral has been returned to the force.""

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again. Willinger brewery in Hesse offered the beer to locals on Thursday. Dozens of people queued up while observing social distancing rules. Many took full buckets and boxes home with them. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that breweries across the country are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports.

For more than a week the White House has been asked to comment on states reopening, despite federal guidelines saying they had not yet met the necessary criteria to do so. ""Something happened,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. ""Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,â he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen ""enormous evidence"" that the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On Wednesday, he told Fox Business network that he had ""seen evidence that this likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" but added that he'd be ""happy to see evidence that disproves that"".

The Nigerian-British musician was known for a witty, mature style that owed more to the old-school US rappers than the grittier street sounds of London.

His death was mourned by stars including Ghetts and Roots Manuva.

Lockdowns put in place to limit the spread of the virus have disrupted economic activity in many nations. It is not yet clear how hard the coronavirus will hit economies in Africa. Before the pandemic, the African Development Bank projected African economic growth to reach 3.9% in 2020, up from 3.4% in 2019. However experts now say the pandemic could cut the continent's growth by 3-8 percentage points this year. Read more here.

Starting on Friday, retail businesses will allow kerbside pickups. Manufacturing will also resume, provided that employees wear masks and stay six feet (two metres) apart. Businesses where staff and customers come into close contact - such as hair salons - have not yet been given the green light to open.

the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a
study by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The study is based on prediction modelling and
analysed 47 countries in the WHO Africa region â more than a billion people. Countries such as Algeria, South
Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures are not
prioritised, the study found. Health services would be
overwhelmed with the sheer number of people requiring hospitalisation, the WHO warned. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for
the virus. Of those, around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their
capacity. A survey of health services in the African
region undertaken in March 2020 revealed that there were on average nine
intensive care unit beds per million people. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO
Regional Director for Africa, said: âCovid-19 could become a fixture in our
lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many
governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.â A federal judge in the US has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen, suggesting a rule to close them during the coronavirus crisis imposed an âimproper burdenâ on the constitutional rights of citizens. Gun shops were closed in March along with other businesses deemed non-essential. However, some purchasers, retailers and gun rights groups sued, arguing it was an unconstitutional ban on acquiring firearms and ammunition for self-defence purposes. US district judge Douglas Woodlock said he would direct the state to allow gun shops to reopen on Saturday with social distancing measures. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market reopened on Thursday under some restrictions Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett has announced a âsecond breakthroughâ towards a possible treatment for Covid-19 patients. On Monday, he hailed the state-run Israel Institute for
Biological Research (IIBR) for developing a âmonoclonal neutralising antibodyâ that
could neutralise the disease inside carriersâ bodies. Scientists there have now found a set of three more
antibodies, which âspecifically bind to distinct elementsâ of the Covid-19 virus
and stop it infecting cells, according to Mr Bennett. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iâve ordered Israelâs Defense Ministry to spare no money or resources to make this happen,â he tweeted, adding that he viewed this as Israelâs âManhattan Projectâ to defeat the pandemic. The IIBR is âpursuing a patentâ for the antibodies, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce them. But Mr Bennett stressed that the breakthrough had âthe
potential to progress towards a treatment for corona patients, and that it is
not a vaccine for wide useâ. A brewery in Germany has handed out 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer for free in order to prepare their tanks for when bars open again.

"Ian Grand is angry that he hasn't had the money back from the cancelled PGL trip his three children were looking forward to Angry parents are demanding their cash back from a specialist school holiday company. PGL hosts children at residential activity centres across the UK, but has had to cancel visits during the coronavirus lockdown. Parents are asking for their money back, but PGL - dubbed Parents Get Lost by children - has refused. Instead, the school holiday company is offering customers a ""refund credit note"". PGL runs short-stay school trips with outdoor activities for thousands of pupils each year at sites across the UK and in France. Like the rest of the travel industry, the coronavirus crisis has had a ""significant impact"" on its business. If the customer wants a cash refund, the refund credit note entitles them to obtain the money in March 2021, or they can use the credit note for booking a future holiday. Hard-up families say that's not good enough and if the situation were to be reversed, they would be unlikely to be able to defer paying for another 10 months. Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: Schools face losses for cancelled trips Coronavirus: 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Ian Grand of Worksop in Nottinghamshire booked a four-day break with PGL for his three children, plus his niece and nephew, for the end of May, at a cost of Â£1,583.75. After the company cancelled the holiday in March, the family asked for their money back, but six weeks later they're still waiting. ""They offered me a credit note but I wasn't keen as I was worried that should PGL go under, I would lose out,"" Mr Grand told the BBC. ""I asked for a refund, which the terms of the contract stated must be done within 14 days. ""My wife is a self-employed dividend director who has not been offered any support under the government schemes so the only income we can rely on is mine. So having the money from the cancelled booking would be a welcome relief."" Ian reckons that if the situation was reversed and the family had cancelled the holiday, the company would be chasing them for the cash. ""I am quite sure that PGL would refer to the terms and conditions - and rightly so - and we would have lost some or all of the money. Now I am referring to their terms and conditions to argue my point [that] PGL are moving the goal posts, or so it would seem."" Mum Stacey Edwards with children Gypsie-Dee, Cruize and Pixie-Fern Stacey Edwards is a full-time mum of four in Watchet in Somerset and with her husband working a 40-hour week, money is tight. ""My 11-year-old son was due to go on a school trip to France with PGL in mid-March,"" she said. ""Obviously the trip had to be cancelled, but it left lots of parents Â£380 out of pocket and we still don't know what's going on."" The family booked the trip for son Cruize through his school last year and paid for it in full in December. Ms Edwards feels it would be really helpful to have the money back, and other parents feel the same: ""PGL are not talking to parents as the trip was booked through the school, which has told us it has submitted a travel insurance claim. ""Lots of families locally are in the same boat, waiting to hear if they'll get their money back."" PGL - named after the firm's founder Peter Gordon Lawrence - has offered to reschedule trips and is offering a refund credit note to customers. The travel agents' group ABTA has asked the government to amend travel regulations in light of the coronavirus crisis. One proposal is to allow travel firms to issue refund credits as an acceptable and enforceable alternative to immediate cash refunds, and to extend the 14-day period holiday providers have to issue refunds until 31 March 2021. While awaiting clarity from the government on the issue, PGL told the BBC it is offering either flexible rebooking arrangements or a refund credit note, which can be claimed for a cash refund when it expires in March 2021, ""in line with ABTA guidance"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? A spokesman for PGL said: ""We have been waiting for ABTA to receive clarity from the government, which has not been forthcoming."" When it comes to trips organised by schools, the company said it is supporting schools whose trips have been impacted - those who were scheduled to travel before 31 May to make insurance claims. ""This has been acknowledged by the government, the ABI (Association of British Insurers) and various trade and professional and other organisational bodies within the school travel sector, as the best method to secure cash to refund parents,"" said PGL. Many travel firms have adopted a similar policy, but Which? Travel editor Rory Boland reckons that's not good enough. ""It's true that the travel industry is under enormous strain at the moment but they're not the only ones in difficult circumstances,"" he pointed out. ""Lots of people are struggling with money and it's unfair of travel firms to effectively ask them for an interest-free loan."" He added that it should not be up to consumers to bail-out struggling firms: ""The bailout should come from the government."" An ABI spokesperson responded:  ""Where travel operators have a legal obligation to refund customers, insurers expect them to honour that legal agreement. ""Insurance cancellation cover kicks in when no other safety net is available with insurers expecting to pay out Â£275m in cancellation costs due to Covid-19.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Trump: 'This is worse than Pearl Harbor' US President Donald Trump has described the coronavirus pandemic as the ""worst attack"" ever on the United States, pointing the finger at China. Mr Trump said the outbreak had hit the US harder than the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in World War Two, or the 9/11 attacks two decades ago. His administration is weighing punitive actions against China over its early handling of the global emergency. Beijing says the US wants to distract from its own response to the pandemic. Since emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, the coronavirus is confirmed to have infected 1.2 million Americans, killing more than 73,000. Will we ever shake hands again? Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump said: ""We went through the worst attack we've ever had on our country, this is worst attack we've ever had. ""This is worse than Pearl Harbor, this is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this. ""And it should have never happened. Could've been stopped at the source. Could've been stopped in China. It should've been stopped right at the source. And it wasn't."" This video can not be played Life for asylum seekers in lockdown on the US-Mexico border Asked later by a reporter if he saw the pandemic as an actual act of war, Mr Trump indicated the outbreak was America's foe, rather than China. ""I view the invisible enemy [coronavirus] as a war,"" he said. ""I don't like how it got here, because it could have been stopped, but no, I view the invisible enemy like a war."" This video can not be played US shopping centres re-open: 'This is the best day ever' The deepening rift between Washington and Beijing was further underscored on Wednesday as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed his rhetoric against China, accusing it of covering up the outbreak. He stuck by his so far unsubstantiated charge that there is ""enormous evidence"" the coronavirus hatched in a Chinese laboratory, even while acknowledging there is still uncertainty about its origins. ""Those statements are both true,"" America's top diplomat told the BBC. ""We don't have certainty and there is significant evidence that it came from a lab."" Chinese state mediaaccused him of lying. One of the most trusted US public health experts has said the best evidence indicates the virus was not made in a lab. Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of Mr Trump's coronavirus task force, said on Monday the illness appeared to have ""evolved in nature and then jumped species"". President Trump faces a tough re-election campaign in November, but the once humming US economy - which had been his main selling point - is currently in a coronavirus-induced coma. A Pew opinion survey last month found thattwo-thirds of Americans, a historic high,external, view China unfavourably. Butroughly the same margin of poll respondents,externalsaid they believed Mr Trump acted too slowly to contain the pandemic. As Mr Trump found his management of the crisis under scrutiny, he began labelling the outbreak ""the China virus"", but dropped that term last month days before speaking by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both Mr Trump and his likely Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, appear to be fastening on to China's unpopularity as an election issue, with each accusing the other of being a patsy for America's primary economic competitor. As the coronavirus began spreading in the US back in January, Mr Trump signed phase one of a trade deal with China that called a truce in their tariff war. The US president's hopes of sealing a more comprehensive phase two deal are now in limbo because of the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had prepared detailed guidance on how the nation's public places could reopen, but the White House decided against sharing it, US media report. The 17-page document,first reported by the Associated Press,external, has step-by-step guidelines on resuming operations at schools, restaurants, camps, day cares, churches, mass transport, and workplaces. Trump administration officials reportedly asked for changes to the guidelines, saying they were too specific as the virus is affecting regions differently. The White House's previously released guidance is much more vague than the CDC's. The president has repeatedly said state governors are in charge of their reopening process - though some leaders have faced criticism for easing restrictions even as case numbers rise.

"This video can not be played As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes At least 11 people have been killed by a massive gas leak at a chemical plant in southern India, with 800 others taken to hospital. The leak from the LG Polymers plant in the city of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state came as people slept. Doctors say patients have been complaining of a burning sensation in the eyes and difficulties breathing. Areas around the plant have been evacuated. The leak may have been due to negligence, officials say. Reports suggest initial attempts to control the gas leak were unsuccessful but the company and state officials say the situation is now under control. LG said in a statement it was investigating the cause of the incident, and was looking at ways ""to provide speedy treatment"" for those affected. Rajendra Reddy, a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, told the BBC that the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called an emergency disaster meeting. The leak took place at around 03:00 local time (21:30 GMT Wednesday) as the plant was being re-opened for the first time since 24 March, when India went into lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""All those who have been hospitalised are currently stable,"" BK Naik, a local health official, told Reuters news agency. Doctors say 86 patients are being treated on ventilators, but many injured have been discharged. Legal action is being taken against the company, says state Industries Minister Goutam Reddy. Earlier, he told BBC Telugu that it looked as though proper procedures and guidelines were not followed when the South Korean-owned plant was being re-opened. ""We would like the company to proactively respond to the incident and ensure that the same level of responsibility is taken if this incident were to happen in EU or United States,"" he said, adding that the incident had been reported to the Korean embassy. Hundreds have taken ill after the gas leak at a polymer factory Swaroop Rani, a senior police official in Visakhapatnam, told AFP that the plant had been left idle because of the lockdown. ""[The gas] was left there because of the lockdown. It led to a chemical reaction and heat was produced inside the tanks, and the gas leaked because of that."" Local villagers complained around 03:30 and police immediately went to the scene, but had to quickly retreat for fear of being poisoned, the news agency quoted her as saying. ""One could feel the gas in the air and it was not possible for any of us to stay there for more than a few minutes,"" she said. As the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes in panic. Distressing images of people fainting and dropping unconscious on the streets are being shared on social media. ""My eyes were itchy, and I was feeling drowsy, light-headed and slightly breathless,"" Yashwanth Saikumar Ambati, who lives about 300 metres from the plant, told Reuters. Officials said the fumes had spread over a radius of about 3km (2 miles) and people from surrounding areas were evacuated. Although a large number have been admitted to hospital, most should be able to make a recovery, they added. Vijay Gajam, BBC News Telugu A loud banging on the front door woke me up at 03:30. My wife and I rushed to the door, and found our neighbours outside, looking agitated. ""There has been an explosion at Polymers! Leave immediately,"" they told us. I could see people running on the road outside. I spotted my landlord, who also asked me to leave the house as soon as I could. Just then, I began to smell something pungent in the air. We quickly understood what had happened. The smell became stronger and my eyes began to burn. My wife, son and I left the house on my motorbike. As we drove down the street, we saw hundreds of people were fleeing their homes. We kept going until we reached Kailasagiri beach, about 20km away. We only stopped when we couldn't smell the gas any more. Earlier in the day, district health official Dr Naik said many people were feared to be unconscious in their homes. ""There are people who were sleeping,"" AFP quoted him as saying. ""We are working to get people to the hospital. They need oxygenation and fresh air. ""We are trying to understand the long-term impact of the chemical on those who have inhaled it during the leak."" Officials said the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated In the meantime, officials have asked people to protect themselves by covering their faces with a wet cloth. The Indian navy has been helping supply oxygen to patients. India has a tragic history of gas leaks. In 1984, a toxic chemical leak in a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal killed thousands of people, in what is acknowledged to be the world's worst industrial disaster. More than 35 years later, victims say children are still being born with disabilities because of the effects of the methyl isocyanate gas spill. Reporting by BBC Telugu's Satish Balla and Deepthi Bathini Styrene is a colourless, or light yellow, flammable liquid primarily used in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins - it is used in the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs, packaging, synthetic marble, flooring, disposable tableware and moulded furniture Breathing air contaminated with styrene vapours can cause irritation of the nose and throat, coughing and wheezing, and create a build-up of fluid in the lungs Exposure to larger amounts can result in the onset of ""styrene sickness"", the signs and symptoms of which include headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, tiredness, dizziness, confusion and clumsy or unsteady motion (known collectively as central nervous system depression) In some cases exposure to styrene can also result in irregular heartbeats and even coma Several epidemiologic studies suggest there may be an association between styrene exposure and an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma though the evidence is inconclusive Sources: The PHE Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards and US Environment Protection Agency Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"This video can not be played WATCH: Trump: 'This is worse than Pearl Harbor' US President Donald Trump has described the coronavirus pandemic as the ""worst attack"" ever on the United States, pointing the finger at China. Mr Trump said the outbreak had hit the US harder than the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in World War Two, or the 9/11 attacks two decades ago. His administration is weighing punitive actions against China over its early handling of the global emergency. Beijing says the US wants to distract from its own response to the pandemic. Since emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, the coronavirus is confirmed to have infected 1.2 million Americans, killing more than 73,000. Will we ever shake hands again? Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump said: ""We went through the worst attack we've ever had on our country, this is worst attack we've ever had. ""This is worse than Pearl Harbor, this is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never been an attack like this. ""And it should have never happened. Could've been stopped at the source. Could've been stopped in China. It should've been stopped right at the source. And it wasn't."" This video can not be played Life for asylum seekers in lockdown on the US-Mexico border Asked later by a reporter if he saw the pandemic as an actual act of war, Mr Trump indicated the outbreak was America's foe, rather than China. ""I view the invisible enemy [coronavirus] as a war,"" he said. ""I don't like how it got here, because it could have been stopped, but no, I view the invisible enemy like a war."" This video can not be played US shopping centres re-open: 'This is the best day ever' The deepening rift between Washington and Beijing was further underscored on Wednesday as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed his rhetoric against China, accusing it of covering up the outbreak. He stuck by his so far unsubstantiated charge that there is ""enormous evidence"" the coronavirus hatched in a Chinese laboratory, even while acknowledging there is still uncertainty about its origins. ""Those statements are both true,"" America's top diplomat told the BBC. ""We don't have certainty and there is significant evidence that it came from a lab."" Chinese state mediaaccused him of lying. One of the most trusted US public health experts has said the best evidence indicates the virus was not made in a lab. Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of Mr Trump's coronavirus task force, said on Monday the illness appeared to have ""evolved in nature and then jumped species"". President Trump faces a tough re-election campaign in November, but the once humming US economy - which had been his main selling point - is currently in a coronavirus-induced coma. A Pew opinion survey last month found thattwo-thirds of Americans, a historic high,external, view China unfavourably. Butroughly the same margin of poll respondents,externalsaid they believed Mr Trump acted too slowly to contain the pandemic. As Mr Trump found his management of the crisis under scrutiny, he began labelling the outbreak ""the China virus"", but dropped that term last month days before speaking by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both Mr Trump and his likely Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, appear to be fastening on to China's unpopularity as an election issue, with each accusing the other of being a patsy for America's primary economic competitor. As the coronavirus began spreading in the US back in January, Mr Trump signed phase one of a trade deal with China that called a truce in their tariff war. The US president's hopes of sealing a more comprehensive phase two deal are now in limbo because of the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had prepared detailed guidance on how the nation's public places could reopen, but the White House decided against sharing it, US media report. The 17-page document,first reported by the Associated Press,external, has step-by-step guidelines on resuming operations at schools, restaurants, camps, day cares, churches, mass transport, and workplaces. Trump administration officials reportedly asked for changes to the guidelines, saying they were too specific as the virus is affecting regions differently. The White House's previously released guidance is much more vague than the CDC's. The president has repeatedly said state governors are in charge of their reopening process - though some leaders have faced criticism for easing restrictions even as case numbers rise.

"Fear of catching coronavirus on public transport has helped lead to a boom in cycle-to-work schemes. The schemes saw a 200% increase in bicycle orders from people working for emergency services. Demand for more mobility and exercise amid lifestyle changes imposed by the lockdown has also boosted bike sales across the UK. ""Very strong"" bicycle sales at bike and car parts chain Halfords this week saw its shares soar by 23%. Some bike stores are battling to meet demand. Broadribb Cycles in Bicester normally despatches 20-30 bikes a week, but manager Stuart Taylor says the shop is currently selling 50 bikes every day - and seeing a commensurate rise in demand for servicing. ""It's just gone crazy,"" he told the BBC. ""People are dragging bikes out of sheds and garages and finding they need new tyres and cables. ""We normally take in bikes for repair and servicing and deal with them for next day [pick-up]. Now we're booking services for two weeks [ahead]."" Coronavirus: How will you commute to work after lockdown? Coronavirus: Tube numbers to be 'severely restricted' At Lunar Cycles repair shop in north London, the mechanic says trade was booming, then ended the call to avoid upsetting the socially-distanced queue outside. Andrew Hassard from Mango Bikes in Ballyclare, Northern Ireland, said: ""The bicycle industry is having a boom. People are saying 'I'm getting back on a bike after 15-20 years - I'm going to use it during lockdown - then commute on it as well,' to avoid public transport."" A recent poll for the consultants SYSTRA suggested 61% of Britons arenervous of taking public transport post-lockdown. Adrian Warren who runs an alliance of cycle schemes, told the BBC: ""This past six weeks, we have seen the biggest experiment in transport policy this country has even known. It's clear the default option is cycling."" Cycle schemes allow employees to claim a tax credit on bikes they buy at work. But rusty cyclists may be nervous on busy roads, so the pressure group Cycling UK has commissioned research showing how 100 ""pop-up"" lanes in 10 English cities could make cycling and walking easier. It maps UK cities which have created extra cycle lines during the crisis, in many casestaking over one car lane on a dual carriageway,external. Andrew Hassard of Mango Bikes says people now want bicycles as a form of regular exercise during the lockdown The Cycling UK research from Leeds looks at English cities with a high cycling potential and has identified 99.2 miles of streets and roads in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Bristol, Leicester, Sheffield, Newcastle and Cambridge which could benefit from temporary walking and cycling infrastructure. Cities round the world have beenfreeing space for people on foot and bikes,external, in response to the coronavirus lockdown. In Germany, expanded cycle lanes have been marked by removable tape and mobile signs. Paris is rolling out 650 kilometres of cycleways,including a number of pop-up ""corona cycleways"",external. Some cities,like Milan, are making the changes permanent,external. The Scottish government has announcedÂ£10m of funding for councils to provide temporary space on the roads this way,external, and Cycling UK is urging ministers in Westminster to follow suit. Temporary walking infrastructure set up on British roads during the coronavirus lockdown In London, the walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, told the Online magazine BikeBiz that the capital's public transport capacity is running at a fifth of pre-crisis levels, meaning post-lockdown up to eight million journeys a day will need to be made by other means. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has in fact said thathe favours getting people out of their cars, overall. Mr Shapps told Sky News that he sees cycling and walking as part of the solution. ""Active transport can keep people off public transport and get people to work under their own steam - and that can be a very important part of this [the nation's post-lockdown] recovery as well,"" he said. Not everyone is in favour: The libertarian group the Alliance of British Drivers has strongly opposed removing road space from motorists.

"Ian Grand is angry that he hasn't had the money back from the cancelled PGL trip his three children were looking forward to Angry parents are demanding their cash back from a specialist school holiday company. PGL hosts children at residential activity centres across the UK, but has had to cancel visits during the coronavirus lockdown. Parents are asking for their money back, but PGL - dubbed Parents Get Lost by children - has refused. Instead, the school holiday company is offering customers a ""refund credit note"". PGL runs short-stay school trips with outdoor activities for thousands of pupils each year at sites across the UK and in France. Like the rest of the travel industry, the coronavirus crisis has had a ""significant impact"" on its business. If the customer wants a cash refund, the refund credit note entitles them to obtain the money in March 2021, or they can use the credit note for booking a future holiday. Hard-up families say that's not good enough and if the situation were to be reversed, they would be unlikely to be able to defer paying for another 10 months. Coronavirus: Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: Schools face losses for cancelled trips Coronavirus: 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Ian Grand of Worksop in Nottinghamshire booked a four-day break with PGL for his three children, plus his niece and nephew, for the end of May, at a cost of Â£1,583.75. After the company cancelled the holiday in March, the family asked for their money back, but six weeks later they're still waiting. ""They offered me a credit note but I wasn't keen as I was worried that should PGL go under, I would lose out,"" Mr Grand told the BBC. ""I asked for a refund, which the terms of the contract stated must be done within 14 days. ""My wife is a self-employed dividend director who has not been offered any support under the government schemes so the only income we can rely on is mine. So having the money from the cancelled booking would be a welcome relief."" Ian reckons that if the situation was reversed and the family had cancelled the holiday, the company would be chasing them for the cash. ""I am quite sure that PGL would refer to the terms and conditions - and rightly so - and we would have lost some or all of the money. Now I am referring to their terms and conditions to argue my point [that] PGL are moving the goal posts, or so it would seem.""

"This video can not be played Any lockdown changes will be ""modest"", says Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The PM says the government will proceed with ""maximum caution"" when considering easing coronavirus restrictions. Boris Johnson is due to announce plans for England's lockdown on Sunday, but ministers have insisted short term changes to measures will be ""modest"". At the government's daily briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described media reports on easing restrictions as ""not a reliable guide"". He added that changes may vary between the different nations. It comes after Scotland's lockdownwas formally extendedand the Northern Ireland Executive said there was""no headroom"" yet to ease the lockdown. Wales is due to announced itsthe nation's lockdown plans on Friday, after the Welsh government warned media reports speculating how Mr Johnson might ease lockdown measuresrisked sending ""mixed messages""to the public. Some newspapers suggested the rules on exercise could be relaxed and more people encouraged to return to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to make their own decisions on lockdown regulations - and could lift restrictions at a different rate. Mixed messages across the four nations Is it time to free healthy people from restrictions? What will be the 'new normal'? The five tests for ending lockdown The prime minister has told leaders of the devolved nations that he is committed to a UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus ""even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds"", Downing Street said. ""Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation,"" a No 10 spokesman added. The latest figures show the total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 30,615 - a daily increase of 539. The UK provided some 86,583 tests in 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Thursday - meaning the government missed its 100,000-per-day target for the fifth consecutive day. There were reports restrictions on outdoor exercise could be lifted in England from Monday People all over the UK joined in the weekly clap for NHS staff and other key workers on Thursday evening At the briefing, Mr Raab said any short term changes to restrictions would be ""modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored"". He stressed that the existing rules would still apply over the bank holiday weekend and urged people to ""continue to follow the guidance"". Facing pressure over media reports suggesting the lockdown would be eased, the foreign secretary said that reports were ""not a reliable guide"" to future policy decisions. Coronavirus: Is R the crucial number? He added that future decisions would be based on the reproduction number - known as the R level - which represents the average number of people that an infected person will pass the virus on to. ""If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren't following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place,"" he said. Mr Raab said the R number was somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9. However, Prof John Edmunds, who is advising the government, said earlier that it had actually risen slightly - to between 0.75 and one. An R number greater than one would result in exponential growth in the number of cases. But if the number stays lower than one, the disease will eventually peter out as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Sir Ian Diamond, the chief statistician for the Office for National Statistics, saidthe current R numberwas below one. However, he said R had increased since the last estimates due to the rise in virus transmission in care homes. The R number can be different in different parts of the country or in different settings, says the BBC's health reporter Rachel Schraer. ""The question is how contained they are or whether the epidemic in care homes will spread back into the community,"" she said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""right to extend the lockdown"" until the infection rate was under control, saying that ""the health and safety of the nation needs to come first"". He added that ""there needs to be absolute clarity that we must follow the rules"". With much speculation about Sunday's announcement, the government seems keen to manage expectations. Dominic Raab's emphasis was on gradual steps; he spoke of this being a delicate and dangerous moment with the virus remaining deadly. He said the prime minister would set out a road map of how the country might come out of this lockdown, but the government doesn't want to release the handbrake and see the car race away just yet. Today's press conference seemed designed to both offer a glimmer of hope about how the country might move on from lockdown, and to shroud it in caution - with emphasis that current measures still remain in place. Whether that message comes across as clear, or confused, is the key question at what could be a crucial moment in managing this pandemic. By law, the government must review the restrictions every three weeks, and Thursday marks the latest deadline. Although the lockdown - first announced on 23 March - will largely stay in place, the ""stay at home"" message is expected to be scrapped and it is likely more outdoor activities will be permitted. The prime minister will make his address at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Johnson has told opposition leaders he will deliver a statement in the House of Commons on the government's next steps on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to drop the stay at home message as she announced that the nation's lockdown was to be extended. She said any easing of restrictions would be ""very risky"" at this stage, but said the Scottish government may be prepared to allow people to spend more time outdoors. Scotlandhas already set out a number of options for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Ms Sturgeon said she would prefer the UK to make changes as a whole, but said the four nations could decide in a ""grown-up"" manner if they ""want to go different ways"". She added that media reports about the prime minister planning to ease the lockdown had not been discussed with the Scottish government. Earlier, a Welsh government spokesman said it was ""crucially important"" people in Wales were ""informed clearly and accurately"" about any changes to the current restrictions. ""Some of the reporting in today's newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK,"" he added. It comes as the UKbecame the first country in Europeto record more than 30,000 people dying with coronavirus. It has been just over nine weeks since the UK recorded its first death on 2 March. The personal stories of those who have died are continuing to emerge. Among those was Dr Tariq Shafi, 61,who was the lead consultant for haematology for 13 years at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent. Dr Tariq Shaf was described as a ""dedicated and respected"" doctor In other developments: The Bank of England has warned that the pandemicwill push the UK economy towards its deepest recession on record Black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus as white people in England and Wales,according to the Office for National Statistics The UK has said 400,000 surgicalgowns ordered from Turkey do not meet British safety standards Notting Hill Carnival has been cancelled, with organisers saying this was ""the only safe option"" amid the pandemic People have been warned to avoid beauty spots this bank holiday weekend,as temperatures are predicted to soar across England British Airways owner IAG has said it is planning for a ""meaningful return"" of flightsin July at the earliest if lockdown measures are relaxed People across the UKjoined Clap for Carers for the seventh week in a row How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?
