"Russia has told ""unfriendly"" foreign countries they must start paying for gas in roubles or it will cut supplies. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating buyers ""must open rouble accounts in Russian banks"" from Friday. ""Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity either - that is, existing contracts will be stopped,"" the Russian president said. Mr Putin's demand is being seen as an attempt to boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. His decree means foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. Though the order comes into effect for gas exported from Friday onwards, the payments for that gas will not be paid by European buyers until mid-May, Dr Jack Sharples, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC. That suggests there may not be an immediate threat to supplies. Mr Putin said the switch to roubles was meant to strengthen Russia's sovereignty, and it would stick to its obligations on all contracts, if Western nations obliged. Germany said the change announced by Mr Putin amounted to ""blackmail"". Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations have issued economic and trading sanctions on Russia, but the European Union has not placed bans on oil or gas, unlike the US and Canada, as its member nations rely heavily on it. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. Meanwhile, Russia currently gets â¬400m (Â£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. For the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has outlined a pathway for the cutting of gas supplies to Europe if Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism mean that, in practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned by the EU, for the purpose of continuity of energy trade. As a result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the stratosphere. There should be a workaround. As one leading analyst told me, this solution has ""saved face"" for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV. Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. Ultimately, Russia still needs the money for the gas, and still wants to leave the possibility of a market for its main export once a peace deal is signed. However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough set of financial sanctions. Analysts said Russia halting gas flows to EU member countries to ""force the issue"" would mark a ""major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War"". ""It would mark another major financial blow to Russia's coffers,"" the analysts at Fitch Solutions added. It is also unclear whether Russia's new payment mechanism for gas would fully ban payments in euros. Western companies and governments have rejected Russia's demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts, which are set in euros or US dollars. Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said German companies would continue to pay for Russian gas using euros as stipulated in contracts. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the move by Mr Putin was an attempt to put economic pressure ""back on Europe"" and that more foreign exchange demand for roubles would likely push up the value of the currency. ""However, long term Russia needs to remain a reliable supplier of gas so it is unclear if they would actually restrict gas supply,"" he added. ""That said, even the risk of it is keeping UK/European gas prices at near record highs and six times the 10-year average. This is translating to steep rises in consumers' energy bills."" The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago between Russia and Germany Dr Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the two sides could adapt and continue their trade uninterrupted, or one or both parties could claim breach of contract and escalate the situation. ""One would hope that even if the situation escalated to a point where one or both parties call for arbitration, that the gas would continue to flow. However, a stoppage cannot be ruled out,"" he said. Germany, which gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia, has urged its citizens and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages. Austria, which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia, is tightening its monitoring of the market. Under an existing gas emergency plan, the ""early warning phase"", which both Germany and Austria have begun, is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage, the governments would bring in gas rationing. Elsewhere, Bulgaria, which gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom, has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the country's gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.

"Millions of people will now feel the impact of an unprecedented Â£700-a-year rise in energy costs - at the same time as a host of bill hikes take effect. The 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay Â£1,971 per year. A further rise pushing the annual bill up to Â£2,600 should be expected in October, one analyst has told the BBC. Council tax, water bills and car tax are also going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. Why are prices rising so quickly? The Â£693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of Â£708 a year. Among them is Winston Carrington, a grandfather in his 70s, who said he was growing vegetables in the garden of his Manchester home to help ease the impact of the rising cost of living. Winston Carrington is worried about covering his bills ""I'm going to grow, and I'm going to fill my freezer this year with my own produce. I'm going to have to,"" said Mr Carrington, who uses a prepayment meter. ""I can't go away this year again, not because of Covid or anything. I just can't afford to go away. The state pension that we're getting at the moment does not cover what I need."" Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. New official figures suggest,externalfour in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. However, official forecasters and analysts have warned people to be braced for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. Wholesale prices have been affected by the war in Ukraine and ongoing pressure on suppliers. This could add another Â£629 to a typical bill in October, according to the most up-to-date prediction, provided to the BBC from leading energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight. If this proved to be accurate, then the average bill next winter would be double that of the winter just gone. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky.

""We are going to see an extra Â£500 or Â£600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he toldthe BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. Council taxes and water bills are also going up for many people, added to the rising cost of food and household items. One estimate suggests that a typical consumer is now facing a Â£73 a month increase in bills, of which about Â£58 is from rising energy costs. ""The added cost pressures set to come into play in April threatens to obliterate even the most finely tuned budgets."" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. Even before the latest increases, charity Citizens Advice said that in March, it referred 24,752 people to food banks or to other charitable support, up by 44% compared to the same month last year. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a Â£200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a Â£150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak toldthe BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.""

"Germany and Austria have triggered emergency plans over possible gas supply disruption amid a payments stand-off with Russia. Russia had demanded ""unfriendly"" countries pay for its gas in roubles from 31 March, but the EU, which mainly pays in euros, rejected the idea. Moscow later appeared to soften its stance, saying on Wednesday rouble payments would be introduced gradually. But Germany and Austria have taken the first steps towards gas rationing Germany urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages, while Austria said it was tightening its monitoring of the gas market. Germany gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia and has warned that it could face a recession if supplies suddenly stopped. Neighbouring Austria relies on Russia much more for gas, with the country getting about 80% from the country and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer's office said measures such as gas rationing would only come into play in an ""immediate crisis"". Under an existing gas emergency plan, the ""early warning phase"", which both Germany and Austria have begun, is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage, the governments would bring in gas rationing. German economy minister Robert Habeck said the country's gas supplies were safeguarded for the time being, but said it was increasing precautionary measures in case of escalation by Russia. The head of German network regulator Bundesnetzagentur, Klaus MÃ¼ller, said the aim of the early warning was to avoid a deterioration of supply. He urged consumers and industry to prepare for ""all scenarios"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not demand payments in roubles from Thursday. ""Payments and delivery is a time consuming process... from a technological point of view, this is a more prolonged process,"" he said. Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps Russia considers accepting Bitcoin for oil and gas The West has been imposing sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that natural gas exported to Europe should be paid for in roubles. Analysts say the move will support the country's currency, which fell sharply after the invasion but has begun to recover. Europe, which in total imports about 40% of its gas from Russia and pays mostly in euros, says Russia's state-controlled gas giant Gazprom cannot redraw contracts. But Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, said on Wednesday: ""European politicians need to stop the talk, stop trying to find some justification about why they cannot pay in roubles. ""If you want gas, find roubles."" The Kremlin also said Russia could start demanding payment in roubles for other commodities such as fertiliser, grain, metals and timber. France gets around 20% of its gas from Russia and the head of the country's CRE regulatory body said it did not expect any supply issues Bulgaria gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom. Its natural gas grid operator has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the country's gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions Poland gets around 50% of its gas per year from Russia but says it has no current plans to limit gas use Greece receives about 40% of its gas via a pipeline that bypasses Ukraine. Its government will meet to assess supply security if Russia switches the tap off Italy gets around 40% of its gas supply from Russia and is monitoring the situation. It will wait to see if Gazprom sends contract amendments to operators before it takes any further decisions The Netherlands gets between 15%-20% of its gas from Russia. The Dutch government said it will ask people to use less gas but it is not yet activating its gas crisis plan Britain gets around 3% of gas from Russia and says it has a range of sources to ensure supply German business leaders have welcomed Berlin's announcement of an ""early warning"" of a gas emergency. That's because German industry would be the first to be hit by gas rationing if Russia turned off the taps. If Germany was forced to ration gas, households and emergency services, such as hospitals, would get priority. This would hit manufacturers that rely on gas for production particularly hard, pushing up prices and possibly leading to job losses. This early warning stage aims to help businesses plan for any future shortfalls: a crisis group of representatives from the government will meet daily. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck also hopes for support from the public and has called for people to save energy where possible. ""Every kilowatt helps,"" he said. So far there are no gas shortages - Germany had large reserves. But over the past year Russia has failed to keep German gas reserve tanks fully stocked - some believe this indicates a long-standing plan by the Kremlin to use gas as a weapon against Europe. S&P Global energy analyst Laurent Ruseckas said Russia and the EU were involved in ""a game of chicken"" over who would back down first. ""Putin started it last Wednesday, with his first comment about requiring the change to payment in roubles, and now the EU has responded at a political level, saying: 'Well, no, we won't,'"" he told the BBC World Service. ""Something has got to give here."" He said the most likely next step was for the EU and Gazprom to seek a compromise by redrawing contracts, as both sides have an interest in resolving the stand-off. Russia currently gets â¬400m (Â£340m) per day from gas sales to the EU and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. However, Mr Ruseckas said there was a small chance ""the brinksmanship leads very quickly towards a cut-off"". This would force Germany to run more coal plants, import as much liquified natural gas as possible, and in the longer term build more renewable energy production.

"Comparing prices of every day items can help bring your spending down, experts say Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years and millions of households are facing the prospect of a soaring energy bill. We asked four experts for their top tips on what people can do to protect their finances and soften the blow of rising bills. Being a wedding or party guest can be expensive - consider whether you need to go to every occasion A good starting point is to look in-depth at your spending to find out exactly where your money is going, says Bola Sol, author of How to Save It. ""Start by assessing if there is room for negotiation in any of your fixed expenses,"" she says. ""Is there a better and cheaper provider?"" When it comes to variable monthly outgoings decide what should stay and what should go, she says. ""Every budget needs a miscellaneous fund for those expenses you did not see coming,"" she says. ""Have one in for each month."" ""Look at your calendar at who is celebrating a birthday, baby shower, wedding or occasion this month,"" she says. ""Ask yourself, if you go, how much will it cost you and is it worth going given the current climate?"" She suggests joining supermarket rewards schemes and family deals for streaming services as well as comparing prices online and searching for discount codes. Having treats like takeaway coffee less often could add up to decent savings says finance analyst Myron Jobson Small cuts in lots of places can be a less painful way to improve your finances, says Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at the investment platform, Interactive Investor. ""While making huge cuts to a few areas of spending could significantly ease the cost of living squeeze on your finances, they could also have an unacceptable knock-on effect on your quality of life and take a heavy toll on mental and emotional health,"" he says. But small changes can add up, he says. ""For example, you do not have to completely forgo your daily coffee purchase, but you can cut back on how often you buy them."" After over two years of Covid restrictions, many of us are keen to spend money on getting out more, he says. ""Halving the number of jaunts averaging Â£50 a week in a month, for example, would give you an extra Â£100 a month which could go towards footing the extra Â£57.75 a month increase to the average energy bill,"" he says. It's important to check you're getting all the benefits you are eligible for, the Citizens Advice Bureau If you are facing tough times it is important to make sure you are getting all the support you are entitled to, says Kayley Hignell, the head of families, welfare and work at Citizens Advice. You can use theCitizens Advice benefits calculator,externalto work out if here's any help you could be claiming, she says. ""Important benefits to consider might be Personal Independent Payment, if you need extra help for an illness or disability, or universal credit if you are on a low income or unemployed,"" she says. ""Pension Credit, which can top up your income in retirement, is something many people do not know they are entitled to. ""There are also schemes like local council tax reductions and the new Household Support Fund where you will need to speak to your local council about what might be on offer."" Low-income families might also be able to get help with the costs of sending children to school, including school meals, transport and uniform through your local education authority, she says. Money problems can impact on your mental health and vice versa, experts say Mental health and finances can be intrinsically linked, says Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. This means money troubles can have a serious impact on our mental wellbeing, and vice versa, she says. ""If you are feeling stressed or worried about your financial situation, it is important to know that you are not alone and there is help out there,"" she says. ""There is no debt problem that is not fixable with the right support. If you're struggling to keep up with bills, there are lots of free debt advice organisations that can help,"" she says. ""Similarly, if your finances are starting to take a toll on your mental health, it's important to seek help."" She suggests contacting your GP or speaking to a charity like the Samaritans. ""In recent years lots of banks and energy companies have introduced tools to help customers manage their finances so it is worth asking your providers what they can offer,"" she says. These include sending copies of bills and other letters to a nominated person of your choice, so that they can help you make decisions. Some banks now offer a carer's card, which is a debit card for a loved one to use on your behalf for limited purposes such as grocery shopping, she says. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak and Will Smith both saw their wives mocked, but the chancellor says: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody."" Rishi Sunak has said he finds it ""very upsetting"" that his wife has faced criticism over shares she owns in a tech company operating in Russia. The chancellor compared his feelings to those of film star Will Smith, whose own wife was mocked at the Oscars. But he joked: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody, which is good."" Mr Sunak's wife Akshata Murty owns shares thought to be worth more than Â£400m in Indian firm Infosys, founded by her father, Narayana. The chancellor has himself come in for several days of criticism over last week's Spring Statement, which opposition parties say did too little to address the spiralling cost of living. Sunak faces questions over firm operating in Russia How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Chris Rock's first comments since Will Smith slap He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""I think it's totally fine for people to take shots at me. It's fair game. I'm the one sitting here and that's what I signed up for."" But he added: ""It's very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my wife, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father-in-law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he's achieved. ""And no amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he's wonderful and has achieved a huge amount."" Mr Sunak also mentioned England cricket captain Joe Root, whose team lost a Test series to the West Indies at the weekend, and Mr Smith, who slapped comedian Chris Rock in the face when he mocked his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, over her alopecia at Sunday's Oscars. Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock after he mocked his wife He told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""Someone said, 'Joe Root, Will Smith, and me - not the best of weekends for any of us.' ""But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked - at least I didn't get up and slap anybody, which is good."" Multinational software giant Infosys has kept what it calls a ""small team of employees based out of Russia"" following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Labour and the Lib Dems have said Mr Sunak has questions to answer about whether his family benefits from the shareholding at a time when he is calling for UK businesses to divest from Russia. UK inflation is surging, on the back rising food and energy prices, with Office for Budget Responsibility predicting that living standards will drop by 2.2% this year - the largest fall since the 1950s. Labour hasurged Mr Sunak to do moreto reduce the pressure on households by imposing a windfall tax on profits made by gas and oil firms. Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty But the chancellor said: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. ""We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly."" Mr Sunak added that he did not think increasing government borrowing to give households more help ""would be sensible"", arguing: ""Actually, it has the risk of making the problem worse when you've got inflation and interest rates going up."" He said: ""Some of these things are difficult. They're certainly unpopular. But they're responsible and will help us in the long-term and I'm not going to deviate from that just for some short-term popularity gain.""

"Millions of people will now feel the impact of an unprecedented Â£700-a-year rise in energy costs - at the same time as a host of bill hikes take effect. The 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay Â£1,971 per year. A further rise pushing the annual bill up to Â£2,600 should be expected in October, one analyst has told the BBC. Council tax, water bills and car tax are also going up for some on 1 April. Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow. Why are prices rising so quickly? The Â£693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of Â£708 a year. Among them is Winston Carrington, a grandfather in his 70s, who said he was growing vegetables in the garden of his Manchester home to help ease the impact of the rising cost of living. Winston Carrington is worried about covering his bills ""I'm going to grow, and I'm going to fill my freezer this year with my own produce. I'm going to have to,"" said Mr Carrington, who uses a prepayment meter. ""I can't go away this year again, not because of Covid or anything. I just can't afford to go away. The state pension that we're getting at the moment does not cover what I need."" Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals. New official figures suggest,externalfour in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s. It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced. The cap, set every six months for England. Wales and Scotland, is designed to protect domestic customers from the volatility of wholesale energy prices. However, official forecasters and analysts have warned people to be braced for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October. Wholesale prices have been affected by the war in Ukraine and ongoing pressure on suppliers. This could add another Â£629 to a typical bill in October, according to the most up-to-date prediction, provided to the BBC from leading energy consultancy firm Cornwall Insight. If this proved to be accurate, then the average bill next winter would be double that of the winter just gone. A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky.

""We are going to see an extra Â£500 or Â£600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."" Chris O'Shea, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the UK's largest supplier British Gas, said his business was supporting struggling customers and was giving grants to those most in need. ""We would love to do more. The reality is that for a retail energy company, the market has gone through quite a change, and profits have reduced quite substantially,"" he toldthe BBC's Big Green Money Show. However, he accepted that profits had risen sharply for the heavily taxed exploration arm of the business. Council taxes and water bills are also going up for many people, added to the rising cost of food and household items. One estimate suggests that a typical consumer is now facing a Â£73 a month increase in bills, of which about Â£58 is from rising energy costs. ""The added cost pressures set to come into play in April threatens to obliterate even the most finely tuned budgets."" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor. The Office for National Statistics said that low earners, renters, parents, people with disabilities, unemployed people and divorcees were least able to afford a bill shock. Even before the latest increases, charity Citizens Advice said that in March, it referred 24,752 people to food banks or to other charitable support, up by 44% compared to the same month last year. The government has said it was taking ""decisive action"" to help people with the cost of living, including a Â£200 reduction to energy bills in October - which needs to be paid back in instalments, and a Â£150 reduction in council tax bills for 80% of billpayers. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour party, branded the government's response as ""pathetic"". He accused the government of forcing people to choose between heating their homes or eating. He said that the Labour party would introduce a one-off windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies and use the money to help households struggling to cope with rising energy bills. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak toldthe BBC's Newscast: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly.""

Let's take a look at some of the major developments on Thursday:  Read more from our daily Ukraine roundup. We've heard from Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, one of the negotiators who suffered symptoms ofsuspected poisoning at peace talksalongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich earlier this month. One report after the incident said,externalthe alleged poisoning was orchestrated by Russian hardliners who wanted to sabotage the talks. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""I feel better now, I feel good, but there was a situation. ""But my colleagues who are more competent in this sphere are analysing what it was and I hope during the shortest period of time they will be able to finalise it [their analysis] and I will be able to comment on it more thoroughly."" He said that while the talks were ""very tense"" at the start, ""it takes courage to find solutions and to meet"". ""Weâve had several rounds of
negotiations and at the end of the day weâre
coming to some sort of collective security agreement articles that we are
trying to negotiate."" Umerov added: ""Weâve been given a task
to find a solution so Iâm treating it as work and trying my best to find
political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation in the south and the Donbas region remain extremely difficult. In a video address tonight, he reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. ""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said. Russia said earlier a humanitarian corridor would be opened tomorrow to allowcivilians out of the south eastern port city of Mariupol. The Pentagon said on Thursday it did not know if Russia's convoy of military vehicles converging on Kyiv, which once stretched some 40 miles, ""still exists at this point"". ""It's been now so long,"" said spokesman John Kirby. ""They never really accomplished their mission."" The stalled convoy was never re-supplied, he noted, and was making little effort to advance on the capital even before Moscow announced its plans to reposition troops. âWe don't think that they properly planned for logistics and sustainment of a force that size in the field under combat conditions,â Kirby said. âIt's also a function of Ukrainian resistance and agility and frankly, just battlefield smarts,â he added. This video can not be played A 3D model earlier this month showed the size of the Russian convoy Nick BeakeBBC News Europe correspondent, in Brussels The EU is to urge China not to provide weapons to Russia in its war on Ukraine, nor give President Putin relief from Western sanctions. China's President Xi Jinping â who has refused to condemn Moscowâs attack on its neighbour - will hold a three-hour virtual summit with officials on Friday, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. At the start of February, China and Russia issued a long, joint declaration saying theirs was a relationship with ""no limits"". European leaders were worried by what they saw as a manifesto to redefine the international order. A few weeks later, President Putin invaded Ukraine. Western officials now believe Moscow has asked Beijing for military assistance and other help to cushion the blow of sanctions. EU sources say von der Leyen will urge President Xi to reject such Russian requests and instead use Chinaâs might to bring the fighting to an end â arguing the damage to the global economy benefits no one. But Chinaâs foreign minister has praised Russia this week for, in his words, preventing a large-scale humanitarian crisis and insisted the relationship with Moscow was heading in the right direction. Brussels officials are not expecting any significant agreement from the virtual talks but hope China will consider dissuading Putin from using weapons of mass destruction as his war grinds on. Yvette Cooper said the situation people were facing was ""Kafkaesque"" The UK has two visa schemes for Ukrainian refugees: The Ukraine Family Scheme, for people with a close relative living in the UK, and Homes for Ukraine, which allows people to sponsor named refugees, housing them in their homes or buildings. But thousands of families are being ""left in limbo"" as a result of bureaucracy, Labour has warned. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs earlier today that the schemes are not working, and went on to give a number of examples. ""A businesswoman who is trying to get her sister and daughter to come here on the family visa scheme is still waiting, 10 days since she applied to the Home Office. ""A constituent of mine in Pontefract who applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme has been waiting nearly two weeks to hear anything back from the Home Office. ""Another British host who has applied for a visa for a woman undergoing a high-risk pregnancy [has been] waiting 12 days for a reply, despite the Home Office helpline saying she'd be treated as a priority."" On Wednesday, the UK said it had issued 2,700 visas through the Homes for Ukraine scheme and 22,800 under the Ukraine Family Scheme, which has been running for longer. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent, Delhi Russiaâs Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has
touched down in India, the latest official to visit in what feels like a
conveyor belt of diplomacy. In the last week or so, delegations from China,
America, Germany, Japan and Mexico have also passed through. Lavrovâs
arrival came just as UK Foreign Secretary Liz Trusswrapped up a day of meetings in Delhi.While sheâs unlikely to bump into Lavrov, the fact
theyâre both here at the same time is an indication of how India is being wooed
from all sides. New Delhi has remained neutral on the issue of Ukraine. Prime
Minister Modi has called for the violence to end, but has stopped short of
denouncing Russiaâs actions. Fridayâs talks with Lavrov are expected to
include discussions on how India can buy more cheap oil from Russia, using a
payment system that would not breach sanctions regulations. But the US deputy
national security adviser Daleep Singh, who is yet another visitor in Delhi
today, warned there would be âconsequences
to countries that actively attempt to circumvent or backfill the
sanctions"". India is keen to stress that Russian oil makes up a tiny
proportion of its overall purchases and that the EU still buys far more. India's position remains one of
neutrality. Here, Moscow remains a friend, not a foe. As Thursday draws to an end in Ukraine, here are some pictures of people affected by the war on the 36th day of Russia's invasion. Relatives of a Ukrainian soldier, Yuriy Oliynyk, attend his burial in the western city of Lviv This man was among several people brought to a centre in Kyiv after being evacuated from the town of Irpin Xenia comforts her baby Alexander in a refugee centre in Lviv station, after fleeing her home in Kyiv A Ukrainian soldier carries a child from a displaced family across a river on the outskirts of Kyiv Refugees are still arriving in Poland, although the UN says numbers have slowed in recent days Russia is now a ""lesser country"" as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, says UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. Speaking to Sky News, he adds: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army."" Wallace says Russian forces appear to be regrouping and shifting their focus towards the south and east of Ukraine. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" He adds that international allies have agreed to supply more military equipment and ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine, including armoured vehicles and long-range artillery and ammunition. The US president has told journalists he is sceptical of Russian claims that it would pull troops away from Kyiv and focus on the east of the country. ""It's an open question whether he's actually pulling back,"" Joe Biden told journalists. ""Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all his forces out of Kyiv. There is also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbass area,"" he said. ""I don't know the answer, it appears so far...  the idea that he's pulling all his troops out from around Kyiv and moving south - there's no evidence he's done that,"" he added If you're just joining us, here is a recap of some of the main developments today: On the international stage:  On the ground: Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Putin had damaged himself through a series of ""catastrophic misjudgements"" Earlier this afternoon, the head of Britain's armed forces gave his update on the war. In a speech followed by a question-and-answer session at the Institute for Government think tank, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin echoed sentiments made elsewhere by the UK and US, that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces. He said the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of withdrawing from the capital Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine. ""We are starting to see the early indications of those forces being moved back from Kyiv and retreating to both Russia and Belarus,"" Radakin said. ""That in itself is a difficult evolution for Russia because they are doing that under contact, so Ukraine armed forces will attack those Russian forces as they retreat."" Radakin, who replaced General Sir Nick Carter in the top job late last year, warned the coming weeks would ""continue to be very difficult"" for Ukraine, before adding: ""But in many ways, Putin has already lost. ""Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements."" US President Joe Biden says Russian President Vladimir Putin ""seems to be self-isolating"". ""There's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" he claims. ""I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence."" More now from US President Joe Biden. He says moving towards clean energy will help Americans deal with rising fuel prices. The US must ""double down on clean energy"", Biden says, which includes passing his bill currently before Congress. Biden says he's issuing a directive to strengthen the US's clean energy economy, using the Defense Production Act - which gives the government increased power over domestic industries in emergencies. This will help secure American supply chains and reduce dependence on China and other countries for materials such as lithium, nickel and graphite, which are used in electric cars and energy storage, he says, in order to ""build a made-in-America clean energy future"". This, he says, will save Americans money. President Biden said high oil prices were ""hitting Americans at the pump"" US President Joe Biden is speaking about the way high oil prices are ""hitting Americans at the pump"". ""I know how much it hurts,"" he says. He says banning Russian oil imports was ""the right thing to do"" but it would ""come with a cost"". Biden says US oil companies are recording increasing profits and have a choice: Between putting these to use by producing more oil, giving US people a break, or ""they can exploit the situation"". Biden says he is announcing a ""use-it-or-lose it"" policy, where companies will face fees for idle wells if they do not restart production.  President Joe Biden is now announcing plans to release a record amount of oil from US strategic stockpiles, in response to the Ukraine war. We'll bring you updates from what he says. Wyre DaviesBBC News, Zaporizhzhia Here in Zaporizhzhia, the last big city in Ukrainian held territory in the south east, local officials and aid workers are preparing to receive thousands of refugees from Mariupol. Tens of thousands of people are trapped in the city after weeks of fighting and heavy Russian bombardments. Organised by the Ukrainian government in conjunction with the Red Cross, the convoy of 45 buses, supported by medical vehicles, will depart from Zaporizhzhia on Friday but only if all sides can agree on a 24 hour ceasefire around the city. Previous attempts to establish humanitarian corridors from Mariupol failed after vehicles were attack on the roads out. A spokesperson for the ICRC said it was âdesperately important the operation takes place - the lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it"". Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor For
the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic
battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir
Putinhas outlined a pathway for the cutting off gas supplies to Europe, if
Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the
rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism, means that, in
practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to
Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned, for the purpose of
continuity of energy trade. As a
result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the
stratosphere. There should be a work-around. As one leading analyst told me,
this solution has âsaved faceâ for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV.
Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian
supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of
the Cold War. Ultimately,
Russia still needs the money for the gas and still wants to leave the
possibility of a market for its main export, once a peace deal is signed.
However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU
nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more
willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The
net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to
freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the
gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and
gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough
set of financial sanctions. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.9609862e-06

In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines.

Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars.

"Gas supplier Firmus Energy has announced its prices for natural gas will increase by 16.31% in its Ten Towns network. The company said this rise, which will affect about 55,000 customers in the area, will take effect from 3 May 2022. In February, Firmus Energy hadannounced its prices would increase by 33.57% in its Ten Towns network. That was the fourth increase by the company since last spring. The Ten Towns area includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry. Gas bills to rise by a third for some households Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns Why are energy bills going up? Interim managing director of Firmus Energy, Niall Martindale, said ""energy markets remain at very high levels having been adversely affected by the war in Ukraine"". ""This has been reflected across the board with increases in the costs of home heating oil, coal, electricity, and gas,"" he added. ""Regrettably the sheer scale of the increased costs involved give us no alternative but to pass on to our customers the higher costs we are having to pay for the gas we supply. ""Firmus Energy is committed to reducing its tariff for all customers as soon as the market crisis subsides and enables us to do so."" He said the company understood ""it is a tough time"" for many customers and it had been ""providing financial and administrative support to the Department for Communities scheme to help those most in need"". ""If any of our customers need further support, I would urge them to call our dedicated local team to see if we can help."" Mr Martindale said the company would announce ""a tariff change for the Greater Belfast network area in the coming days"". The Utility Regulator said the price increase would mean that the average annual household gas bill will rise from Â£1,293 to Â£1,504 per year. In January, it had warned that gas prices would increase. The wholesale price of gas makes up more than half of consumers' bills. A worldwide squeeze on energy supplies pushed the price of gas up last year. But wholesale prices have risen even higher since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which is the world's largest natural gas exporter The UK gets little of its gas from Russia directly, but prices could still be driven up worldwide if Russian supplies to Europe were affected. John French said he recognised the ""energy crisis is putting the most vulnerable in our society under considerable strain"" Utility Regulator chief executive, John French, said on Thursday that after consultation with the Department for the Economy and the Consumer Council for Northern Ireland it had concluded that a 16.31% increase ""was now needed to reflect the harsh underlying market conditions"". ""I completely recognise that this energy crisis is putting the most vulnerable in our society under considerable strain,"" he said. ""I would therefore encourage anyone who is struggling with their bills to get in touch with their energy company as soon as they can. ""The regulatory process ensures that energy companies have clear obligations on how they act and how they provide support to consumers. ""We will continue to work with government, industry and support agencies to do whatever we can to support consumers through this crisis, in one of the most challenging markets we have seen in our history."" Raymond Gormley, head of energy policy at the Consumer Council, said it was important for consumers to be made aware that their domestic gas bills ""will stay high for at least the next year"", due to the wholesale price of gas being ""much more expensive than the norm"". ""Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets,"" he added. ""This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating."" Mr Gormley urged the energy industry to ""commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year"". In January, anemergency winter fuel payment schemeopened for applications, with 11 companies from across the energy sector pledging more than Â£250,000 in donations to the scheme. This scheme closes for applications on Thursday. Why are energy bills going up?

"Mariupol residents Yevgen and Natalia have made it to Lviv in western Ukraine There is no humanitarian corridor now out of Mariupol. Just a trickle of people gambling on Russian military checkpoints - and Russian political whim. But getting out of the besieged southern city is only the first challenge; the other is leaving it behind when you do. Alexander was brought to an Israeli field hospital near Lviv last week, catatonic. His 24-year-old brain was stuck on the horror he'd lived through: on the Russian rockets that hit the apartment block where he was staying with his parents; on the rubble and dead bodies they ran through, without even putting on their shoes. ""It was constant bombing,"" says his father, Yevgen. ""Planes went past every 10 minutes and dropped bombs on Mariupol. People were falling and dying in front of my eyes. We buried people in gardens."" The family found shelter with hundreds of others in a cinema near the city centre. Trapped there by Russian attacks, they survived on scraps of food from locals or Ukrainian soldiers, boiling snow to drink. The family are staying with friends outside Lviv after fleeing Mariupol When supplies ran critically low, Natalia says, everyone without young children was asked to leave - to save resources and give the children a chance. ""We had a car that was damaged, but still working,"" she said, ""so we decided to leave the shelter. There was no way out: you could stay and die, or you could go and die. You couldn't even count minutes between the bombs."" Memories like these mask their old lives like a second skin. The destruction and damage to Mariupol is carried out of the city with them; invisible shrapnel, lodged in their minds. Some 160,000 people are still thought to be trapped in Mariupol Mariupol's mayor says 5,000 people have been killed, and 90% of the buildings damaged. Some of their pro-Russian neighbours, Natalia says, believed it was Ukrainian forces pounding their city to dust. She refers to the Russian soldiers sarcastically as ""our saviours"" or ""those charming boys"", describing the pressure tactics she saw them use. ""After the shelling, those 'handsome boys' would appear and try to hand out sweets,"" she said. ""Some people couldn't resist taking them, because they hadn't eaten for several days. When you're suffering like that, you'll take anything."" Natalia says they were told to flee when resources ran low Some 160,000 people are thought to still be trapped inside the city. France, Greece and Turkey have all tried to push for a pause in the attacks to get aid in and allow civilians to leave. But Russia's President Putin has said Mariupol must surrender in order for the bombardment to stop. Alexander and his family are now staying with friends outside Lviv. And Alexander has just been discharged and allowed to go ""home"". His father Yevgen is a musician, with one remaining saxophone he salvaged from the city before he left. Before taking his son home from hospital, he gave staff at the hospital a concert, Alexander smiling on beside him. Gathered between the medical tents to listen, half the doctors were in tears. They listened to the beautiful sound from the man who had lost so much, but who stood there, giving thanks for what he saved from Mariupol: his saxophone, and his son.

"Russian forces have been besieging Mariupol for weeks Fresh efforts are under way to evacuate civilians trapped by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses was on its way to the besieged southern city. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to Mariupol. Tens of thousands of civilians remain there after weeks of bombardment. Ms Vereshchuk also accused Russian troops of blocking the bus convoy at a checkpoint near Vasylivka, three hours' drive from Mariupol, earlier in the day. ""The Russian Federation, again, does not let our buses pass,"" she told Ukrainian news agency Unian. The Russian defence ministry said the United Nations refugee agency and the Red Cross would assist in the evacuation of civilians. The evacuation was initially planned for Thursday, but the Red Cross has since told Reuters that for logistical and security reasons, the evacuation will now happen on Friday. It said a ceasefire would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. A spokesperson for the ICRC said its teams were ready to help get civilians out of Mariupol from Friday, but only if all parties agreed on the terms. ""It's desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it,"" the spokesperson added. The BBC has spoken to people who have managed to leave the besieged port city in the last few weeks. All of them described a city in ruins, with entire districts completely flattened. Diana Yalovets, a 23-year-old student, said: ""As we tried to get out, we needed to cross the city centre. It was scary to see destroyed streets and buildings. ""My school was destroyed. It's painful to see your once beautiful city this way. ""Mariupol was a safe city. We loved to walk near the sea. There was a park, and it was an amazing place just to sit and talk. I just can't believe we lost everything we had."" Although some residents have escaped, all previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused offorcibly relocating thousands of civiliansto Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Capturing the city would give Russia control of the Azov Sea coastline between Russia and Crimea. The announcement of a truce follows a telephone call on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. During the conversation, Mr Putin said that shelling of Mariupol would not end until Ukrainian troops surrendered.

"Liz Truss meets India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov are both visiting India in competing efforts to strengthen ties. Ms Truss is urging Delhi to work with other democracies to counter Russia's invasion of Ukraine, by reducing its dependence on Moscow. The Russian foreign minister will call on India to bypass Western sanctions, and buy more Russian oil and gas. India has not condemned the invasion and did not vote against it at the UN. Ms Truss, who has spoken of a ""network of liberty"", told her Indian opposite number Subrahmanyam Jaishankar it was vital that democracies worked together to deter aggressors. Appearing alongside him at an event in Delhi, she said the war in Ukraine had also underlined the need for ""like-minded nations"" to co-operate more closely on defence, trade, and energy and food security. The foreign secretary also said the UK wanted to see stronger sanctions against Russia - including further measures against its banks, its ability to use its gold reserves, and its access to ports. Sanctions should end only after withdrawal - Truss Â£1bn UK-India deals to create 6,000 UK jobs - PM But Mr Lavrov is using his visit to push for closer trade links to help reduce the impact of the sanctions imposed on Moscow. Earlier this month, India agreed to import three million barrels of heavily discounted Russian oil. The foreign minister flew to Delhi from talks in China, which has also declined to criticise Russia's actions in Ukraine. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, said Delhi's reluctance to criticise the war reflected its Cold War ties with Moscow and the fact that about 70% of its military hardware came from Russia. US President Joe Biden has described India as ""somewhat shaky"" on the conflict. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the UK understood why India had ""chosen to sit on the fence at the moment"" - because of its ""connections in both directions"". This video can not be played Watch: Truss urges Russia to ""abandon Cold War rhetoric"" in February But it was ""really important"" that democratic nations ""stood up"" for their values and the rule of law, she added. However, speaking in Delhi, the foreign secretary said India was a sovereign nation, and the UK would not tell other countries what to do. She said she was confident a free trade deal between the UK and India could be completed ""pretty rapidly"", adding that this could involve ""Indian production of key pieces of defence equipment"". A strong India and a strong UK was not ""just good for us, it's good for the world,"" she added. During her trip, Ms Truss will also confirm Â£70m of UK investment in the development of renewable energy in India, one of the world's biggest users of hydrocarbons. She will announce a joint cyber-security programme aimed at protecting online infrastructure in both countries from attacks.

"The club opened in 1980 and has hosted dozens of internationally renowned artists A legendary club widely regarded as one of the UK's premier live music venues has been told it must close. The Leadmill, in Sheffield, opened its doors in 1980 and has hosted artists including Pulp, Coldplay, The Stone Roses and Oasis. Venue bosses said their landlord had served them with an eviction notice requiring them to quit the building next year. Fans, artists and a local MP have backed a campaign to save the Leadmill. Based near Sheffield's main railway station, the venue is regularly voted as the city's best for live music and has won national awards. It also hosts comedy acts and regular club nights. A spokesperson said: ""Since 1980, The Leadmill has spent millions of pounds on what was a derelict warehouse, transforming it into one of the U.K's most respected venues, where countless acts from across the globe have performed over the years."" The club has hosted some of the biggest names in British music over the past four decades A slew of bands leapt on the announcement to highlight the role the club has played in giving musicians a start in their careers. The Kaiser Chiefs recalled playing the club in their early days,saying,externalthey had ""very fond memories"" and closing the Leadmill would be a huge loss not just for Sheffield and Yorkshire, but the whole UK music scene.""

By David Keller, BBC News Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner auctioned a black Fender Stratocaster in aid of the Leadmill in 2020 The Leadmill is not just a music venue, but a place of fond memories for thousands who have caught the biggest artists of the day, before they went on to arenas and superstardom. It has been many a students' first night out, the site of blossoming romances and where countless revellers have been showered in beer as their favourite band struck the first note. As a former employee during my degree, I had the task of keeping schtum while helping to prepare a secret gig for Arctic Monkeys on the launch of their second album. Naturally, being held in Sheffield. And just in the space of a year, I and many others managed to catch acts including Happy Mondays, Graham Coxon, local lads Reverend and the Makers and Milburn, Enter Shikari, Imogen Heap, Biffy Clyro, Lily Allen, Plan B, and many, many more. If the venue disappears for good, it would be devastating not just for music fans, but for the staff, DJs, sound engineers, hospitality and trades that rely on it for their income. The club has launched a social media campaign -#WeCantLoseLeadmill,external- urging fans to help them make the case against closure. Music Venue Trust, a charity which acts to protect grassroots music venues,said,externalit was aware of the situation and working with the venue to try and ensure its survival. Bosses at the Leadmill have previously spoken about the venue's struggles during the pandemic. An Arts Council grant of Â£241,571, and Â£128,544 from Arctic Monkeys singer Alex Turner - who auctioned off a guitar in aid of the club - helped it to stay afloat.

"Cash to arrange catch-up tutoring for pupils after Covid will go directly to schools in England next year, says the government, in a move that axes its contract with supplier Randstad. It follows calls to pull the contract, with many schools finding it easier to source their own tutoring. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the move was ""building on the success of school-led tutoring"". Randstad said school-led tuition was ""proving the most attractive"" option. MPs said this monththat the Randstad contract should be scrapped if performance did not improve. The National Tutoring Programme (NTP), introduced in 2020, is the government's scheme to help students catch up on the learning they lost in the pandemic. Schools choose the pupils they think will benefit most from additional tuition,which is 15 hours in total,,externaland decide whether children are tutored alone or in group sessions. Dutch HR company Randstad was given the contract for running it. It was meant to match tutoring companies with schools - asking firms to register, and schools to bid for tutors using an online portal. Covid closures still affecting 400 million pupils Special needs pupils to receive earlier support Pupils expected to do better in maths and English Covid fuels deepening education inequalities - MPs However, take-up has been poor, with many tutoring companies finding it difficult to get through the approvals processes. By Nathan Standley Cori Bateman has been concerned about the bureaucracy involved in accessing government funding for catch-up support In Luton, the three primary schools in the Pioneer Learning Truststruggled to get the support they neededfrom the National Tutoring Programme. Cori Bateman, the trust's chief executive, says long-winded bureaucratic processes are entrenched in the current system, and there aren't enough university-educated mentors available to work short-term, temporary contracts. ""They're like unicorns, they don't exist,"" she says, adding that her trust has had to share just one mentor among its 1,300 pupils. She has seen disadvantaged children fall further behind as a result. In Sheffield, Nicola Shipman, chief executive of Steel City Schools Partnership, which runs nine academies, says she's looking forward to schools having more power to address the ""hidden challenges"" of getting pupils caught up after Covid. ""Some of our children have only just had their first ever school assembly,"" she says. ""Our preference would've been to just give us the money, as we know our children best."" She is happy about the move to the school-led approach for tutoring, but thinks time and money have been wasted. Mr Zahawi recently diverted money away from its contract with Randstad to instead allow schools to bid directly for a subsidy for tutoring. The Department for Education (DfE) has now said that Â£349m of tutoring funding for the 2022-23 academic year will go straight to schools to ""simplify the system and give schools the freedom to decide how best to provide tutoring for their children"". Mr Zahawi said the overhaul of the NTP was ""building on the success of school-led tutoring so far - with evidence as our watchword"". The DfE said it would launch a procurement process in April for a potential new supplier, which would be responsible for quality assurance, recruitment, deploying mentors and offering training. Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the NTP had ""failed our children and wasted millions of pounds of public money"". Randstad said this academic year had shown school-led tuition was ""proving the most attractive to schools"". Karen Guthrie, director of the NTP at the company, said it had ""always supported the position that schools know best"", and welcomed ""the fact the department has recognised this"". ""We also support a fair and transparent procurement process, and appreciate that a material change in programme scope requires a new procurement exercise as is right and proper in the protection of public funds,"" she said. ""Randstad will look to continue its relationship with the DfE if we believe it is in the best interest of the programme and all those benefiting from it."" Research suggeststeenagers' reading skills have fallen further this year. MPs on the Education Select Committee have said the government's efforts to help children catch up amounted to""a spaghetti junction of funding"". The committee's report this month said the NTP had only reached 52,000 courses so far - just 10% of this year's target for tutoring courses - and suggested scrapping the contract if the numbers did not improve. Robert Halfon, the committee's Conservative chairman, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme he had been ""really worried about the performance of Randstad"". ""I think this is the right decision, because what we should do is give schools the autonomy,"" he said. ""They know best how to spend their money on the catch-up."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the news that all funding would go directly to schools. ""The way it has been structured through various funding streams and providers is overly and unnecessarily complicated for something that should really be very simple,"" he said. ""There is good evidence that small group tutoring helps students to progress, and it makes perfect sense for the entirety of the funding to go to schools, so that they can decide how this would best be delivered.""

"Russian forces have been besieging Mariupol for weeks Fresh efforts are under way to evacuate civilians trapped by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of 45 Ukrainian buses was on its way to the besieged southern city. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to Mariupol. Tens of thousands of civilians remain there after weeks of bombardment. Ms Vereshchuk also accused Russian troops of blocking the bus convoy at a checkpoint near Vasylivka, three hours' drive from Mariupol, earlier in the day. ""The Russian Federation, again, does not let our buses pass,"" she told Ukrainian news agency Unian. The Russian defence ministry said the United Nations refugee agency and the Red Cross would assist in the evacuation of civilians. The evacuation was initially planned for Thursday, but the Red Cross has since told Reuters that for logistical and security reasons, the evacuation will now happen on Friday. It said a ceasefire would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. A spokesperson for the ICRC said its teams were ready to help get civilians out of Mariupol from Friday, but only if all parties agreed on the terms. ""It's desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it,"" the spokesperson added. The BBC has spoken to people who have managed to leave the besieged port city in the last few weeks. All of them described a city in ruins, with entire districts completely flattened. Diana Yalovets, a 23-year-old student, said: ""As we tried to get out, we needed to cross the city centre. It was scary to see destroyed streets and buildings. ""My school was destroyed. It's painful to see your once beautiful city this way. ""Mariupol was a safe city. We loved to walk near the sea. There was a park, and it was an amazing place just to sit and talk. I just can't believe we lost everything we had."" Although some residents have escaped, all previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused offorcibly relocating thousands of civiliansto Russia or Russian-controlled areas. Capturing the city would give Russia control of the Azov Sea coastline between Russia and Crimea. The announcement of a truce follows a telephone call on Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. During the conversation, Mr Putin said that shelling of Mariupol would not end until Ukrainian troops surrendered.

"Clare met Diana and Olena at the airport ""That's her, isn't it?"" Clare Maddox nervously asked her daughter, Sophia, as they waited by the arrivals gates at Stansted Airport. They were looking out for a mother and daughter - two refugees who were among the first to arrive in the UK under the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. It had been 11 years since they last saw Diana Sachavo in the flesh. She had visited the UK, aged 10. Diana had come over with the help of the charity Chernobyl Children's Lifeline and stayed with the Clare and Sophia at their house in Billericay, Essex. Afterwards, they had stayed in touch. Now she was returning - alongside her mother - this time as a refugee. ""I'm so glad you are here,"" Clare told them, as she was introduced to Diana's mum, Olena, for the first time. Their flight from Lithuania had just landed and Clare tearfully hugged both women, not letting them go. 100,000 sign up to UK's refugee site in first day Homes for Ukraine: 'It's sad, slow and frustrating' 2,700 visas issued through Homes for Ukraine Diana and Olena had to leave their home in the town of Irpin. It has been heavily bombed by Russia. They first travelled to Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, then to the western city of Lviv, before fleeing for Poland, then Lithuania. They arrived in the UK as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which launched two weeks ago. Yetlatest figures suggestthey are among the lucky ones. Just 2,700 visas have so far been granted under the scheme. The number of applications has already passed 28,000. Diana and Olena's home town Irpin has suffered heavy Russian bombardment As part of the scheme, Ukrainian families who are escaping the war - like the Sachavos - can come to the UK for up to three years and receive access to healthcare and benefits, provided a named individual agrees to put them up for a minimum of six months. Those with citizenship or settled status are able to bring their family over to stay under a separate Home Office scheme. ""I think they are very brave making that really terrifying journey,"" Clare told the BBC. ""I can't tell them how incredibly sad I am that they have had to make that journey. Hopefully I can just make their lives a little bit better than they have just been experiencing."" ""We had to find the courage to choose the safest moment for us to escape the shelling,"" Olena added. ""I am safe and my daughter is safe and that is the main thing. I am extremely grateful to you, Clare, and to all the people who have been so kind to us."" How can I offer a UK home to Ukrainian refugees? The refugee host family with 'all the love to give' Yet most families who have registered for the scheme are still waiting for news. Many are increasingly frustrated at how slow the process is going. Garry Taylor, a project manager from Southend-on-Sea, made contact with Yuliia Chernovil and her seven-year-old daughter Alisa via social media a day after the UK scheme was launched. The mother and daughter had to flee the eastern region of Donetsk, heading for Lviv. They are now living in a refugee camp in Warsaw, across the border in Poland, with rows of camp beds lined up next to each other. Yuliia Chernovil and her seven-year-old daughter Alisa had to flee the eastern region of Donetsk With two children of his own, Garry was keen to help out and share his house, with its large garden and trampoline. But two weeks on, his would-be guests are still stuck in Poland waiting for a passport for Alisa to be issued. ""The process hasn't been thought through,"" he says. ""It's embarrassing having to ask every day: 'Have you had any news on your visa'?"" ""You've got countries across Europe welcoming people with open arms. I've seen some leaflets in Poland saying: 'Don't worry about the formalities, we'll worry about those afterwards'. Yet, you've got all of this red tape that we seem to have created here."" LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine SURVIVAL:'They won't tell me how many bullets were in me' SHOOTING:Does video show Ukrainian war crime? READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external After we asked the government about the case, Garry says Yuliia received an email from the Home Office telling her she needed to upload more photos of her passport. They have now had to make another appointment at the visa centre in Poland. Many hosts in England, like Garry, are getting much of their information from groups popping up on social media, where there is still a steady stream of both people offering accommodation and those seeking a place to say. Some report frustration with the time it is taking to issue visas and the lack of updates. There are also reports of problems uploading documents to the scheme's portal, as Garry discovered. Scotland and Wales have taken a different approach, acting as so-called ""super sponsors"". This means any Ukrainian can apply without a named sponsor and they will initially be given temporary accommodation before a home is found for them. Garry Taylor, pictured here with his family, made contact with Yuliia via social media There has been criticism of the scheme since it was launched and charities have said the process in England ""is just too difficult"" for those fleeing Ukraine. They have called for the UK to stop requiring visas for those fleeing Ukraine. Downing Street meanwhile has said the Home Office has made the process quicker and easier - including making the visa form shorter, and allowing valid passport holders to apply online and complete biometric checks in the UK. But refugees minister Lord Harrington acknowledged more needed to be done. ""We are starting to see progress because of changes the Home Office made to streamline the visa process and put additional resources into the system. ""However, we need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible. I look forward to welcoming more families and ensuring they have the support they need when they arrive."" Update: A short time after this story was published, Yuliia and her daughter received the final documents they needed to be able to travel to the UK.

"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. The perils of rising gas prices for Biden Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"". America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created following the energy crisis in the 1970s It is located in storage caverns in salt domes along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana The reserves held about 568m barrels as of 25 March, down from more than 700m at their peak in 2009 The International Energy Agency has forecast consumption of more than 100m barrels per day of petroleum and liquid fuels this year Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this monthafter Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering? Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden. The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production. The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves. Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak and Will Smith both saw their wives mocked, but the chancellor says: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody."" Rishi Sunak has said he finds it ""very upsetting"" that his wife has faced criticism over shares she owns in a tech company operating in Russia. The chancellor compared his feelings to those of film star Will Smith, whose own wife was mocked at the Oscars. But he joked: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody, which is good."" Mr Sunak's wife Akshata Murty owns shares thought to be worth more than Â£400m in Indian firm Infosys, founded by her father, Narayana. The chancellor has himself come in for several days of criticism over last week's Spring Statement, which opposition parties say did too little to address the spiralling cost of living. Sunak faces questions over firm operating in Russia How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Chris Rock's first comments since Will Smith slap He told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""I think it's totally fine for people to take shots at me. It's fair game. I'm the one sitting here and that's what I signed up for."" But he added: ""It's very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my wife, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father-in-law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he's achieved. ""And no amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he's wonderful and has achieved a huge amount."" Mr Sunak also mentioned England cricket captain Joe Root, whose team lost a Test series to the West Indies at the weekend, and Mr Smith, who slapped comedian Chris Rock in the face when he mocked his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, over her alopecia at Sunday's Oscars. Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock after he mocked his wife He told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""Someone said, 'Joe Root, Will Smith, and me - not the best of weekends for any of us.' ""But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked - at least I didn't get up and slap anybody, which is good."" Multinational software giant Infosys has kept what it calls a ""small team of employees based out of Russia"" following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Labour and the Lib Dems have said Mr Sunak has questions to answer about whether his family benefits from the shareholding at a time when he is calling for UK businesses to divest from Russia. UK inflation is surging, on the back rising food and energy prices, with Office for Budget Responsibility predicting that living standards will drop by 2.2% this year - the largest fall since the 1950s. Labour hasurged Mr Sunak to do moreto reduce the pressure on households by imposing a windfall tax on profits made by gas and oil firms. Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty But the chancellor said: ""I'm confident in what we've done. I know it's tough for people. ""We're facing a very difficult situation with the price of things going up and I want to do what we can to ameliorate some of that, but I'm also honest with people that we can't ameliorate all of it, sadly."" Mr Sunak added that he did not think increasing government borrowing to give households more help ""would be sensible"", arguing: ""Actually, it has the risk of making the problem worse when you've got inflation and interest rates going up."" He said: ""Some of these things are difficult. They're certainly unpopular. But they're responsible and will help us in the long-term and I'm not going to deviate from that just for some short-term popularity gain.""

"Russia has told ""unfriendly"" foreign countries they must start paying for gas in roubles or it will cut supplies. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating buyers ""must open rouble accounts in Russian banks"" from Friday. ""Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity either - that is, existing contracts will be stopped,"" the Russian president said. Mr Putin's demand is being seen as an attempt to boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. His decree means foreign buyers of Russian gas would have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. Though the order comes into effect for gas exported from Friday onwards, the payments for that gas will not be paid by European buyers until mid-May, Dr Jack Sharples, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told the BBC. That suggests there may not be an immediate threat to supplies. Mr Putin said the switch to roubles was meant to strengthen Russia's sovereignty, and it would stick to its obligations on all contracts, if Western nations obliged. Germany said the change announced by Mr Putin amounted to ""blackmail"". Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations have issued economic and trading sanctions on Russia, but the European Union has not placed bans on oil or gas, unlike the US and Canada, as its member nations rely heavily on it. The EU gets about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia, and has no easy substitutes if supplies are disrupted. Meanwhile, Russia currently gets â¬400m (Â£340m) per day from gas sales to the bloc and it has no way of rerouting this supply to other markets. For the Kremlin this is designed to suggest a dramatic escalation in the economic battle between the West and Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has outlined a pathway for the cutting of gas supplies to Europe if Western customers refuse to pay for supplies in the Russian currency the rouble. However, the market reaction suggests the details of the mechanism mean that, in practice, European customers will just have to change their currency dealers to Gazprombank. That bank has already been left unsanctioned by the EU, for the purpose of continuity of energy trade. As a result, gas prices remain very high, but did not today shoot into the stratosphere. There should be a workaround. As one leading analyst told me, this solution has ""saved face"" for Putin, who can sound tough on domestic TV. Ultimately, as Russian officials have repeatedly said for decades, Russian supply of energy to the West continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. Ultimately, Russia still needs the money for the gas, and still wants to leave the possibility of a market for its main export once a peace deal is signed. However, it is also true to say that the threat of a cut-off has escalated. EU nations have prepared emergency measures to manage demand, and would be more willing to face that now during spring and summer than winter. The net effect of the mechanism announced is to limit the ability of the West to freeze the revenues they pay to Gazprom, which Putin described as receiving the gas for free. Some Ukrainian officials have suggested such an approach. Oil and gas dollars and euros continue to help the Kremlin resist an otherwise tough set of financial sanctions. Analysts said Russia halting gas flows to EU member countries to ""force the issue"" would mark a ""major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War"". ""It would mark another major financial blow to Russia's coffers,"" the analysts at Fitch Solutions added. It is also unclear whether Russia's new payment mechanism for gas would fully ban payments in euros. Western companies and governments have rejected Russia's demands to pay for gas in roubles as a breach of existing contracts, which are set in euros or US dollars. Germany and Austria take step towards gas rationing Russia to allow unauthorised imports from West German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said German companies would continue to pay for Russian gas using euros as stipulated in contracts. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the move by Mr Putin was an attempt to put economic pressure ""back on Europe"" and that more foreign exchange demand for roubles would likely push up the value of the currency. ""However, long term Russia needs to remain a reliable supplier of gas so it is unclear if they would actually restrict gas supply,"" he added. ""That said, even the risk of it is keeping UK/European gas prices at near record highs and six times the 10-year average. This is translating to steep rises in consumers' energy bills."" The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline was inaugurated just over a decade ago between Russia and Germany Dr Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said the two sides could adapt and continue their trade uninterrupted, or one or both parties could claim breach of contract and escalate the situation. ""One would hope that even if the situation escalated to a point where one or both parties call for arbitration, that the gas would continue to flow. However, a stoppage cannot be ruled out,"" he said. Germany, which gets about half its gas and a third of its oil from Russia, has urged its citizens and companies to reduce consumption in anticipation of possible shortages. Austria, which imports about 40% of its gas from Russia, is tightening its monitoring of the market. Under an existing gas emergency plan, the ""early warning phase"", which both Germany and Austria have begun, is the first of three steps designed to prepare the country for a potential supply shortage. In its final stage, the governments would bring in gas rationing. Elsewhere, Bulgaria, which gets 90% of its gas via imports from Russian company Gazprom, has opened a tender for underground drilling as part of plans to almost double the country's gas storage capacity and prepare for any supply disruptions. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption, as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases. The UK government said it was not planning to pay for Russian gas in roubles.

"Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Griffiths spearheaded calls for the inquiry after their daughters' deaths A police force is investigating about 600 cases of maternity care in a probe of hospital failings that may have led to hundreds of baby deaths. Health Secretary Sajid Javid revealed the scope of the police inquiry during a Commons statement on Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH). Mistakes at its hospitals led to babies being stillborn, dying after birth or being left badly brain damaged,a major review found on Wednesday. The trust has apologised. Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt of West Mercia Police said its investigation was exploring whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved. He said the force had been talking to both medical experts and prosecutors. He added officers' inquiry remained ""very much active"" but no arrests had been made. ""We can reassure the community that when there is an update on our investigation we will share this with the families involved first and foremost and then to the wider public,"" he said. Mr Javid said on Thursday he wanted ""no stone unturned"" in finding those ""responsible for this"". SaTH said it was cooperating fully with West Mercia Police. The major review prompting the police comments was led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden. It examined nearly 1,600 incidents amid parents' fears over safety at the Shropshire trust running Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal Hospital. The cases spanned the years 2000 to 2019, and, on Wednesday, the review concluded catastrophic failures at SaTH may have led to the deaths of nine mothers and more than 200 babies, leaving other infants with major injuries. Detailing repeated mistakes, the report found,external201 babies could have or would have survived if SaTH had provided better care. Rhiannon Davies (left) lost her daughter in 2009 - campaigning by her and others saw the review by Donna Ockenden (right) set up in 2017 On Thursday, Ms Ockenden told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme there was an ""overconfidence""Â in the trust's maternity department. ""They thought they were really good; they were wrong,"" she said. The report highlighted instances of patients being blamed for outcomes, and cases of psychological trauma described as ""harrowing and profound"". They included the following episodes: Before being anaesthetised, a woman who gave birth in 2009 overheard a senior midwife telling a colleague: ""If this baby dies it's on his head."" In 2011, a woman was accused of ""being lazy in labour"" and, as an employee of the trust, was advised against making a complaint A woman with physical disabilities said she was asked by a consultant in 2008 ""how do people like me get pregnant, who would do that to me, and did I know what I was doing""? One woman told the review team that after her daughter's death in 2012, she was given her child and put in a room on the maternity ward where ""we could hear babies crying"" and ""we could hear people being congratulated"". Among the review's conclusions were that the trust was not held to account by external bodies and the reasons for the failures included a lack of staff and ongoing training. Watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC) took until 2018 to rule SaTH's maternity services inadequate, Ms Ockenden told Woman's Hour, saying the vast majority of fatalities examined by her team happened before then. ""There were so many lost opportunities,"" she said. ""In this case of this trust, [the CQC] failed to realise, failed to report, there were very, very significant issues."" Ms Ockenden has made a range of recommendations for SaTH, the wider NHS and the government which include working to deliver safe staffing and giving accurate information to families after poor outcomes. 'We've had to fight all the way for this' Maternity deaths scandal will spark change - Javid Watch on iPlayer: Maternity Scandal - Fighting for the Truth The findings of the Ockenden review are, of course, shocking. Even more alarming is the common thread that runs through this scandal and others. Neglect and abuse at Stafford hospital during the first decade of this century led to the unnecessary suffering and deaths of hundreds of patients, a subsequent inquiry found. Then there was the investigation into University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which uncovered a ""lethal mix of failures"" that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013. Common to all these are poor care, a defensive response by staff and managers and a lack of scrutiny both locally and nationally that failed to uncover the problems for too long. And this is unlikely to be the end of the story. An inquiry into mental health care in Essex between 2000 and 2020 has been launched and there are ongoing investigations into maternity care provided in both Nottingham and Kent. These are all exceptional cases - there is lots of good care in the NHS. But there also seems to be a failure of the culture and systems in the NHS to spot and deal with problems early enough. Emma Priddey said she still struggled with trauma after giving birth to twins in Telford The review was commissioned after two families led a campaign for the inquiry. Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies' daughter Kate died hours after her birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from a Group B Streptococcus infection. SaTH patient Emma Priddey told the BBC she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at Princess Royal Hospital. She said she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech, but then had to be rushed for a ""traumatic"" emergency c-section, after which her babies were not breathing. Both, she said, were now ""completely fine"", although the day after her c-section, she added, she collapsed and was given a hysterectomy, leaving her unable to have any more children. ""I live with it daily, daily things trigger me,"" she said. ""The trauma is on another level for myself and my husband."" Louise Barnett, chief executive at SaTH, said: ""We offer our wholehearted apologies for the pain and distress caused by our failings as a trust."" Mr Javid said while there had been systemic failures which needed changing, there had also been individual failures. ""I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,"" he said. Maria Caulfield, minister for patient safety and primary care, told the BBC a ""perfect storm of failure"" had occurred in Shropshire. Questioned about whether successive Conservative governments had done enough to improve maternity services, Ms Caulfield said she recognised there needed to be ""more midwives on the ground"".

"House prices grew at the fastest annual pace for more than 17 years in March despite the cost of living crisis, according to Nationwide. Annual growth in house prices hit 14.3% in February, the mortgage lender said, the strongest pace since November 2004. The cost of a typical UK home reached a new record high of Â£265,312, rising Â£33,000 in the past year, it said. Prices are being pushed higher by robust demand, limited supply and a strong jobs market, it added. Nationwide, which is one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, said the housing market had ""a surprising amount of momentum given the mounting pressure on household budgets and the steady rise in borrowing costs"". Households in the UK are being squeezed by a cost of living crisis, with prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years as fuel, energy and food costs surge. Mortgage costs are also rising after the Bank of Englandraised interest rates three times in four monthsto try to help lower that price inflation. But these factors have not dampened acceleration in house price growth, Nationwide said. House prices are now more than fifth higher than early 2020 when the pandemic hit. Wales, south-west England and East Anglia saw the highest rates of growth, while London - at 7% - had the lowest rate. ""A combination of robust demand and limited stock of homes on the market has kept upward pressure on prices,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. The UK labour market is strong -job vacancies hit a record high in October last year- and unemployment has continued to fall, which may have helped the housing market, he said. In addition, some people built up ""significant savings"" during lockdowns, which is ""likely to have helped prospective homebuyers raise a deposit"". Despite these factors, Nationwide expects house price growth to slow in the year ahead, due to high inflation rates and interest rate rises. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent body that makes economic forecasts for the government, predicted in October last year that house prices would fall in 2022. It said last week that people in the UK were facing the biggest drop in living standards on recordas wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Many people took stock of how they lived and worked during Covid lockdowns, leading to a race for space among buyers that was fuelled by a stamp duty holiday. In recent months, there has been a shortage of homes on the market to match demand, which has pushed up asking prices. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the housing market was going from ""strength to strength"" but that March ""probably marks the peak for house price growth"". ""For starters, mortgage rates look set to rise further in the coming months,"" she said. ""In addition, we expect housing demand to be hit by a sharp drop in households' real disposable incomes."" The Nationwide's figures came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revised up its UK economic growth estimate for the October to December period last year. It estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.3% in the quarter, as opposed to its previous estimate of a 1% increase. As a result, the ONS said the level of GDP was now 0.1% below the pre-Covid period of the final quarter of 2019, compared with its previous estimate of 0.4% below. The ONS figures also indicated that pressures on household finances were leading people to dip into their savings. The household savings ratio dropped to 6.8% in the October-to-December period, down from 7.5% in the previous three months. ""Savings were at their lowest level since the start of the pandemic as household spending rose, mainly driven by rising prices,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics.

"This video can not be played Wyatt's 129 & Ecclestone's six wickets send England into World Cup final Women's World Cup, Christchurch England 293-8 (50 overs):Wyatt 129, Dunkley 60, Ismail 3-46 South Africa 156 (38 overs):Du Preez 30, Ecclestone 6-36, Shrubsole 2-27 England won by 137 runs Scorecard England will face Australia in the final of the Women's World Cup after Danni Wyatt's magnificent century propelled the defending champions to a 137-run defeat of South Africa. Opener Wyatt took advantage of being dropped five times to crash 129 from 125 balls, the backbone of England's 293-8 in Christchurch. She added 116 for the fifth wicket with Sophia Dunkley, who made a measured 60, while Sophie Ecclestone rounded off the innings with 24 from only 11 balls. South Africa's chances of pulling off the largest chase in women's one-day international history largely rested on the dangerous opening pair of Laura Wolvaardt and Lizelle Lee. But Anya Shrubsole, the hero when England beat the same opponents in the semi-finals in 2017, removed both to leave the Proteas 8-2. Spinner Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, then tore through the lower order for her first international five-wicket haul, ending with 6-36 as South Africa were dismissed for 156. It continued a remarkable turnaround from England, who were on the brink of elimination after losing their first three games but have now won five in a row to reach a second successive final. Heather Knight's side will meet the all-powerful Australians at the Hagley Oval on Sunday (02:00 BST) in what promises to be a grandstand finale to a superb tournament. Knight 'so proud' of England making final This video can not be played 'A career-defining innings' - Wyatt survives five drops to make 129 It seemed scarcely believable that England could reach the final when they lost to South Africa,their third defeat of the group stage,on 14 March. Even some of the players have admitted to believing they were out of the tournament. Since then, they have steadily improved, eradicating errors with the ball and in the field, and finding contributions from most of their batters. The resurgence built to this performance in Christchurch, a dismantling of a talented South Africa side that had previously only lost to Australia. For the Proteas, this was a complete contrast from the previous victory over England. Whereas then it was Knight's side who missed chances in the field, this time it was South Africa who looked affected by the pressure of the occasion. It meant South Africa once again lost in a global semi-final - they have been beaten in all three of their 50-over World Cup last-four ties to go along with two losses at the same stage in the T20 version. The making of England's world number one, Sophie Ecclestone Wyatt has had a nomadic 12-year international career. Originally picked as an off-spinner, she has been moved up and down the batting order and was dropped during the World Cups of 2013 and 2017. However, after being promoted to open earlier in this tournament, she enjoyed her finest hour, making her highest score in an ODI when England needed it most. The five drops were of varying difficulty, but the chances missed by Marizanne Kapp at mid-wicket when Wyatt was on 36, then by Lara Goodall at deep mid-wicket on 77, were particularly poor. The other drops came when Wyatt had 22, 116 and 117. In between, the right-hander slashed through the off side and hustled between the wickets. When England found themselves 126-4 in the 26th over, they were in a parlous position, only for Wyatt and Dunkley to combine in a brave counter-attack. And, after South Africa finally held a Wyatt miscue to short third, Ecclestone's cameo pushed England out of sight. While Ecclestone's figures are eye-catching, it was Shrubsole who effectively ended the South Africa chase before it started. Shrubsole took England to victory in the final and semi-final five years ago, anddragged them over the line with the bat against New Zealand earlier in this tournament.Here, she tumbled to hold Wolvaardt off her own bowling, then had Lee turn a catch to mid-wicket. Left-armer Ecclestone was held back until the 24th over, by which time South Africa were already four wickets down. And, with the lower order exposed, Ecclestone took all of the remaining wickets on offer with her trademark bounce, guile and accuracy. Kapp and Mignon du Preez were bowled, Chloe Tryon, Shabnim Ismail and Masabata Klaas chipped catches and Trish Chetty was stumped by yards to become the last to fall. As Ecclestone grabbed the match ball and Wyatt was named player of the match, some England players were in tears of joy. Only Australia stand in their way of a complete turnaround and another world title. England captain Heather Knight:""I'm really pleased. I think that was a complete performance from us today, what we've been searching for. ""The fact we have played knockout cricket for the last four games has helped us as well. ""We'll go into the final as underdogs but it's a fresh slate, we're all equal on the morning of the game and what a story has been written for us if we can do it."" South Africa captain Sune Luus:""We didn't have our best fielding performance. They played extremely well today, and all credit to them. But we needed to bring our best performance today, and we didn't, so we are feeling that. ""We needed to be more clinical. It's something we will keep working on but we have had a great campaign, we won't be taking away from that.""

Shrubsole took England to victory in the final and semi-final five years ago, anddragged them over the line with the bat against New Zealand earlier in this tournament.Here, she tumbled to hold Wolvaardt off her own bowling, then had Lee turn a catch to mid-wicket. Left-armer Ecclestone was held back until the 24th over, by which time South Africa were already four wickets down. And, with the lower order exposed, Ecclestone took all of the remaining wickets on offer with her trademark bounce, guile and accuracy. Kapp and Mignon du Preez were bowled, Chloe Tryon, Shabnim Ismail and Masabata Klaas chipped catches and Trish Chetty was stumped by yards to become the last to fall. As Ecclestone grabbed the match ball and Wyatt was named player of the match, some England players were in tears of joy. Only Australia stand in their way of a complete turnaround and another world title. England captain Heather Knight:""I'm really pleased. I think that was a complete performance from us today, what we've been searching for. ""The fact we have played knockout cricket for the last four games has helped us as well. ""We'll go into the final as underdogs but it's a fresh slate, we're all equal on the morning of the game and what a story has been written for us if we can do it."" South Africa captain Sune Luus:""We didn't have our best fielding performance. They played extremely well today, and all credit to them. But we needed to bring our best performance today, and we didn't, so we are feeling that. ""We needed to be more clinical. It's something we will keep working on but we have had a great campaign, we won't be taking away from that.""

"Simon Cole had announced his retirement from the force in January but left the job just days ago Tributes have been paid to a recently retired chief constable who was found dead at his home. Former Leicestershire Police Chief Constable Simon Cole, who stepped down last week,was discovered at an addressin Kibworth Harcourt on Wednesday. The 55-year-old had held the position for 12 years and announced his retirement from the force in January. Hundreds of tributes have flooded in from police officers, other forces, council leaders, MPs and faith leaders. People have described Mr Cole as much-loved and respected among the Leicester community Temporary Chief Constable Rob Nixon described Leicestershire Police as ""a force in mourning"". ""A tsunami of emotion has gone across the force,"" he said. ""Some people, who knew Simon really well, they are clearly suffering."" Mr Nixon, who worked as Mr Cole's deputy for four years, said his death was a ""tragic loss"". ""I've lost a huge colleague, friend, mentor and the full extent of that I'm sure will hit me at some point,"" he said. Mr Nixon said his predecessor dedicated his life to public service and he had left behind a legacy of achievements.

"House prices grew at the fastest annual pace for more than 17 years in March despite the cost of living crisis, according to Nationwide. Annual growth in house prices hit 14.3% in February, the mortgage lender said, the strongest pace since November 2004. The cost of a typical UK home reached a new record high of Â£265,312, rising Â£33,000 in the past year, it said. Prices are being pushed higher by robust demand, limited supply and a strong jobs market, it added. Nationwide, which is one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, said the housing market had ""a surprising amount of momentum given the mounting pressure on household budgets and the steady rise in borrowing costs"". Households in the UK are being squeezed by a cost of living crisis, with prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years as fuel, energy and food costs surge. Mortgage costs are also rising after the Bank of Englandraised interest rates three times in four monthsto try to help lower that price inflation. But these factors have not dampened acceleration in house price growth, Nationwide said. House prices are now more than fifth higher than early 2020 when the pandemic hit. Wales, south-west England and East Anglia saw the highest rates of growth, while London - at 7% - had the lowest rate. ""A combination of robust demand and limited stock of homes on the market has kept upward pressure on prices,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. The UK labour market is strong -job vacancies hit a record high in October last year- and unemployment has continued to fall, which may have helped the housing market, he said. In addition, some people built up ""significant savings"" during lockdowns, which is ""likely to have helped prospective homebuyers raise a deposit"". Despite these factors, Nationwide expects house price growth to slow in the year ahead, due to high inflation rates and interest rate rises. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent body that makes economic forecasts for the government, predicted in October last year that house prices would fall in 2022. It said last week that people in the UK were facing the biggest drop in living standards on recordas wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Many people took stock of how they lived and worked during Covid lockdowns, leading to a race for space among buyers that was fuelled by a stamp duty holiday. In recent months, there has been a shortage of homes on the market to match demand, which has pushed up asking prices. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the housing market was going from ""strength to strength"" but that March ""probably marks the peak for house price growth"". ""For starters, mortgage rates look set to rise further in the coming months,"" she said. ""In addition, we expect housing demand to be hit by a sharp drop in households' real disposable incomes."" The Nationwide's figures came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revised up its UK economic growth estimate for the October to December period last year. It estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.3% in the quarter, as opposed to its previous estimate of a 1% increase. As a result, the ONS said the level of GDP was now 0.1% below the pre-Covid period of the final quarter of 2019, compared with its previous estimate of 0.4% below. The ONS figures also indicated that pressures on household finances were leading people to dip into their savings. The household savings ratio dropped to 6.8% in the October-to-December period, down from 7.5% in the previous three months. ""Savings were at their lowest level since the start of the pandemic as household spending rose, mainly driven by rising prices,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics.

"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. The perils of rising gas prices for Biden Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"". America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created following the energy crisis in the 1970s It is located in storage caverns in salt domes along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana The reserves held about 568m barrels as of 25 March, down from more than 700m at their peak in 2009 The International Energy Agency has forecast consumption of more than 100m barrels per day of petroleum and liquid fuels this year Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this monthafter Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering? Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden. The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production. The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves. Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making.

"Laura on College Green in 2017, shortly after a General Election was announced. This won't be the last article I write, but it will be the last one in my job as the BBC's political editor. Before I move on, I've been trying to piece together some of the seismic events that have taken place - the Brexit referendum, the pandemic, Jeremy Corbyn's stormy leadership of the Labour Party, three different prime ministers. It was an extraordinary period, and to help make sense of some of it, I've been comparing notes with five politicians, all of whom were, in one way or another, central to the political battles that went on. ""If you think that the people of this country are going to vote to hurt their wallets, you've got another think coming! It's never happened in 100 years, and it's not going to happen now!"" It was 2016 and I'd been the BBC's political editor for nearly a year. I had called one of the campaign chiefs at Remain HQ to to see how things were going. But rather than chatting about their plans for the crucial last few days, they launched into a tirade against their opponents. They were bellowing loudly - furious, perhaps, because they had started to sense the vote slipping away from them. Tempers flare in politics. People care a lot about winning. They work all hours and get tired and cross. That hasn't changed in seven years. Normally, the next day it's forgotten. But that angry, one-sided conversation stuck in my mind. A highly successful political operative just would not, and could not, believe that the British public might defy convention and vote against what most economic experts agreed even then was in their own, and the country's, financial interest. Watch Everything Has Changed With Laura Kuenssberg, on BBC iPlayer Warnings of economic chaos had worked to secure David Cameron a majority in the 2015 election (although don't forget Labour's historic collapse in Scotland did its bit to send him to Number 10, too). But the referendum was different. It posed questions about identity, about the UK's place in the world. And the result showed conventional wisdom was for fools. It hadn't bargained on the Eurosceptics hunting out new voters, and using new ways to enthuse them. Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader who had campaigned so noisily to have the vote, looks back at how the Eurosceptic movement defied the odds and broke the establishment ""rules"". He describes the referendum as an ""insurgency"". ""I met lots of people who told me, 'I've never voted in my life', but expressed themselves in the EU vote,"" he recalls. In fact, nearly three million more people voted in the referendum than voted in the previous General Election. Farage's campaigning had always pitched him as something different, a politician proud of not fitting in. ""I was what I was, and was outside the norm completely,"" he says. Of course, courting controversy for political effect isn't new. Farage describes how he went about it: ""I had a deliberate technique. I'd say, right, I'm gonna go and say this at this press conference, I know exactly what the reaction is going to be. There'll be howls of indignation. There'll be demands that I apologise. And what I'll do tomorrow is double down."" He joked to me that Boris Johnson has partly stolen his technique. This was being willing to say publicly what, before 2015, might not have been acceptable in mainstream politics, to create arguments, to make political points, and to send messages to the public about who they are. The Brexiteers knew the odds were against them in almost every traditional sense. And remember the official campaign, Vote Leave, wanted nothing to do with Farage's more controversial tactics. Yet they resolved that their route to victory would be to run a different kind of aggressive campaign, making statements they knew would also provoke, and deliberately targeting a blend of messages at voters who may never have cast a ballot before, or who had checked out of politics in the previous decade. They tried to attract voters for whom the economy had done no favours at all. Andrea Leadsom was one of the serving Tory ministers who joined that campaign. She then made her way into the Cabinet, even running to become Prime Minister when Boris Johnson's campaign blew itself up. ""Out on the streets talking to people - they [would] say, 'Well I don't really want to admit it in public but yes, I'm going to vote to Leave,''' she tells me. David Cameron's Remain campaign was more conventional than the Brexiteers', and when he did roam outside the norm and allowed members of his own team to push for Leave, it was arguably a political mistake. ""I distinctly remember David Cameron calling ministers in and saying to all of us: 'What you all have to do is campaign in what you believe is in the best interests of your country, not [in] what the party is telling you to do,'"" says Leadsom. ""And that was an extraordinary thing for him to do. And I think it spelt doom."" Prime Minister David Cameron on his campaign bus in 2016 on the final day of campaigning The prime minister of the day suspended the normal rules by allowing his team to campaign against him. A referendum in itself is an unconventional thing in the UK. But, as the result indicated, convention itself had gone out the window. The referendum came after what had also, on paper, seemed like a huge political upset. Farage might not relish a comparison to the former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn - and Corbyn won't be too happy with it, either. But they have something in common - straying deliberately from the norm. In 2015, the long-serving left winger had already prospered by courting new or disaffected voters, and claiming the mantle of the outsider for himself. The chair of his campaign for the Labour leadership was John McDonnell, who became the shadow chancellor. McDonnell says his comrade's portrayal of being beyond the norm, ""was a huge attraction"". ""Remember, after five years of austerity people had had it bad enough. They weren't just questioning what was happening day-to-day, they were questioning the whole system. So along comes Jeremy Corbyn [and says] actually, I'll tell you why the system doesn't work."" Jeremy Corbyn's campaign forged a different coalition - there were the thousands upon thousands of new voters who joined the party for the first time, and those on the left of the party who felt it had drifted too far from its soul. McDonnell says they consciously decided to pursue victory in novel ways. ""Beyond the normal party politics out there, were a whole range of social movements - the anti-war movement, the people campaigning against austerity and cuts. And we basically said, 'Look, we can win this election if we invite those [groups] into a discussion around more formal politics and getting them to vote as well.' And that's what we did."" And throughout his time, during his struggle to establish control over the Labour Party, he continued to delight many of his supporters, and irritate many others in the Labour movement by refusing to conform. Boris Johnson holds up a kipper at the final Conservative Party leadership election hustings in 2019 Which brings us to the politician who turned a love for pushing convention, into a ticket to Number 10. Boris Johnson is a career politician - just like Corbyn and Farage - although, like them, he would argue otherwise. To claim Johnson is not a member of the elites he has derided, is to ignore the facts. Yet, as someone who has - both as a columnist, and a politician - tried to write his own headlines, the prime minister has got to the top with a technique of saying and sometimes doing what others dare not do. His backers say it's because he's being authentic. I remember a conversation with a voter in Middlesbrough during the 2019 election campaign who said: ""I like Boris because he's just like me. He likes beer, he likes women, and he makes mistakes."" Whatever your view on whether those are qualifications for high office, there's no doubt that Johnson's willingness to be blunt, to be prepared to offend, and yes, to break the rules, has been seen by many voters as a welcome refreshment from smooth, technocratic politicians I've been told so often are ""all the same"". One senior minister still now finds Johnson's apparent need to provoke, to bluster, frustrating. ""It's just not funny anymore,"" they say. But the provocateur is the one in power. It's not remotely clear if the new voting coalition that Boris Johnson built on the foundation of the Brexit vote will see him stay in office for the second term he craves. Yet his huge political personality makes it hard for others to find space to breathe. That trend of convention-busting worries others, though. Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, is one of the tiny number of politicians who was at the top of her game at the start of this era, and who is still there. ""I think some of the conventions have been smashed to bits,"" she tells me. ""And I think the rules of engagement have undoubtedly changed."" The first minister, who is no fan of Boris Johnson, continues: ""I've had deep differences, obviously, with both David Cameron and Theresa May. But, you know, I reflect back on dealing with them and they had a respect for the office. I think they had a basic respect for truth and civilised debate, which I'm sorry to say, I don't think we have in the current incumbent."" During our conversation, Sturgeon also reflects on how politicians have been challenged during this era in ways that they could simply never have dreamt of. During the pandemic their choices influenced all of us in ways they hadn't for generations. Their decisions were matters of life and death. She recalls a sense of dread. ""Around about six o'clock, on a Friday evening, the streets were deserted and I was passing pub after pub. [They were] closing their doors and pulling the shutters down. It was incredible, just such an eerie, unsettling feeling. And I think the thing that was most difficult as a leader to come to terms with was that there were no decisions you could take that wouldn't have caused harm in some way. There were no decisions you could take that would just magically make everything better."" Matt Hancock, who was health secretary during the pandemic, reflects on his toughest moments, from that time. One, he says, was the intense worry during the second lockdown in January 2021 when case numbers were rising even after ministers had taken drastic action. ""They just kept going up, and the numbers in hospital kept going up. When we hit 40,000â¦ well, that's almost half of all the beds in hospitals. So that was the hardest period because you knew there was nothing more you could do. And if it didn't turn, it would have been truly, truly, truly awful, as opposed to just awful."" And the pandemic came hard on the heels of the most intense period of political change we've lived through for a long time. It's turmoil, Matt Hancock tells me is documented on his walls. ""I've got on my wall pictures of four different cabinets that I was in - the David Cameron coalition cabinet, the Cameron post 2015 majority government cabinet, the Theresa May cabinet and the Boris Johnson cabinet. And there's hardly any people who are in all four."" In the end, of course, he suffered his own embarrassing exit. One of the topics that all of the five that I've been speaking to about the past few years is the impact technological change has had on politics. John McDonnell talked about how new campaign methods played a central part to crowning Jeremy Corbyn as leader. ""We had all these young people flood into the campaign, with ideas and techniques I'd never even heard of. And it was all social media,"" he says. ""They knew how to target games, [so] we set up a group called 'games for the many'. And they invented games that people could play that would lead them into a political debate and support for Jeremy."" A supporter of Jeremy Corbyn attends a launch of policy ideas for young people in 2015 Politics online has changed how debates are conducted in the House of Commons, too. And that's not just because you see so many MPs with heads bowed, staring at their phones. Nowadays, speeches aren't just designed for TV sound bites, but sometimes for the snippet for social media, in the hope it will go viral. Andrea Leadsom jokes about the weekly face-offs between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May: ""I always felt... she might say, you know, happy birthday, Jeremy. And he'd be like, that's not good enough!... if you were there, it made no sense. But it was clearly a script that was designed for social media."" Nigel Farage admits that without technology he would never have been able to build his profile, to have the profound effect that he has had on our politics. ""I wouldn't have been a household name without YouTube,"" he jokes. As Nicola Sturgeon quipped, it's quicker to list what hasn't changed in the past seven years, than what has. Technology has allowed toxicity to spread more easily into our debates. The country made a big constitutional decision that stunned the political establishment, but the effects of which are yet to be fully understood. Rule breakers have prospered, for now, and stability has gone out of fashion. The one lesson to take from a dizzying time, perhaps, is that relying on conventional wisdom is a fool's game. A heartfelt thank you for following the extraordinary events of the past seven years along with me. And there'll be more to come, from a different chair, in a few months' time.

"Cancer charities have praised the ""amazing"" job The Wanted singer Tom Parker did raising awareness and funding for brain cancer before his death at the age of 33. He died on Wednesday of terminal brain cancer, having told fans in October 2020 he had an inoperable tumour. ""Tom was a fantastic spokesperson, and he chose to bring attention to the lack of funding,"" National Brain Appeal boss Theresa Dauncey told BBC Breakfast. ""He was amazing, honest and positive."" Tom Parker: 'I'm not paying attention to cancer' Tom Parker: 'Brain cancer treatment must improve' Ms Dauncey said Parker drew attention to ""solutions and treatments over the over his illness"", saying ""so many people would have just shut the doors, locked everyone out and wanted to just stick with their family and friends"". Instead, the singer ""got people together, made a documentary, had a concert [and] brought so many people's attention to this sort of terrible lack of awareness"". Anthony Owen's son Roux was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2019, when he was just four weeks old. Parker reached out to the family after they began documenting Roux's journey on social media. ""He used to send us messages of support when we were in hospital,"" said Owen, who was among the listeners who got in touch with BBC Radio 5 Live on Thursday to discuss how they had been affected by the singer's openness about his cancer journey.

His last few scans have been ""stable"" but has been left with delayed development, epilepsy and is undergoing assessment for cerebral palsy. Ms Dauncey said it was ""incredible that he was so public about his illness, and that he was happy to share his journey"". The singer had said he did not want to talk about ""fighting or battling with cancer"", but the charity chief executive added: ""But in a way, he was because he was, you know, he was shouting about it. ""And I think there must be so many people who had never thought about it before."" The Wanted singer Tom Parker dies aged 33 Tom Parker's life in pictures Susan Short, professor of clinical oncology and neuro-oncology at the University of Leeds, said Parker's medical condition was ""challenging to deal with, even more so when you're in the public eye"". ""It must be very difficult to know how to handle that but he did an amazing job,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It is important that individuals like him help us raise the profile of this disease and let the public know that there are these tumours that are still very challenging to treat."" She said in terms of fundraising for ""vital"" research, the goal was to ""try and move the field on an improved the output of these patients"". ""Tom and the band did that,"" she said. Parker had been diagnosed with an aggressive grade four tumour known as a glioblastoma More than 12,000 people are diagnosed with brain tumours in the UK every year, and around a quarter are glioblastomas Common symptoms of brain tumours include headaches, seizures, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, mental or behavioural changes such as memory problems or changes in personality, progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body and vision or speech problems Treatments depend on a range of factors about the tumour but can include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, medicines to help with symptoms and steroids Parker had chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and went to Spain for what was described as ""revolutionary"" treatment, but his tumour was inoperable Brain cancer survival in England is statistically highest for people diagnosed aged under 40 Parker spoke to the House of Commons All-Party Parliamentary Group on Brain Tumours in December, telling them: ""I'm staggered they can find a cure for Covid within a year but, for decades on end, they haven't found better treatments let alone a cure for brain tumours. On Wednesday, his wife Kelsey Hardwick, who had two young children with the late singer, wrote on social media: ""Thank you to everyone who has supported in his care throughout, he fought until the very end. I'm forever proud of you."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Nandan Kumar is a software developer based in Bangalore A man says he was forced to hack into a domestic Indian airline's website to find his missing luggage. Nandan Kumar, 28, called IndiGo - a low-cost carrier - for help, after realising that he had swapped his bag with a co-passenger. But after IndiGo refused to help him trace the other person, Mr Kumar said he was able to retrieve information about him from the airline website. IndiGo told the BBC that ""at no point was the IndiGo website compromised"". Mr Kumar says he's not a professional hacker, but had to ""do something"" to retrieve his luggage. In a series of tweets, Mr Kumar, a software engineer, said by the time he got to the airport luggage belt, a co-passenger had taken his bag and left. He told the BBC he only realised the mistake after getting home, because both bags looked exactly alike. He was able to identify the other person's Passenger Name Record number or PNR through a luggage tag, but when he called the airline to ask for information about the passenger, they refused to help, citing privacy and data protection rules. Mr Kumar's suitcase (R) and his co-passenger's one (L) looked alike In a statement sent to the BBC, IndiGo said their ""customer care team followed protocol by not sharing any other passenger's contact details with another passenger. This is in line with our data privacy policies."" ""The agent assured me that they would call me back when they are able to reach this person,"" Mr Kumar said. ""But the call never came."" In a statement sent to the BBC, IndiGo airlines said that ""attempts were made by the customer care team to facilitate the exchange of baggage, but it could not be completed as the calls went unanswered."" The next morning, Mr Kumar says he decided to ""take matters"" into his own hands. He started digging into IndiGo's website using his co-passenger's PNR, in the hope of finding an address or a phone number. He tried various methods - using the check-in process, by editing the booking and updating the contact. But none of it worked. ""After all failed attempts, my developer instinct kicked in and I pressed the F12 button on my computer keyboard and opened the developer console on the IndiGo website,"" Mr Kumar said. ""I thought 'let me check the network logs'."" What he found was surprising - his co-passenger's phone number. ""To be frank, I only checked for a phone number or an email. Basically anything I could use to get in touch to retrieve my bag."" He says, however, that the system's data should have been encrypted, adding that it allowed anyone to access private information. ""A PNR and a last name is very easy to get. People share their boarding passes. Anyone can see your bags, take a picture and later use it get your information,"" Mr Kumar says. But it all ended well for Mr Kumar and his bag. He called his fellow passenger with the phone number he had retrieved from the system logs, and the two met up to swap their luggage.

"Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Griffiths spearheaded calls for the inquiry after their daughters' deaths A police force is investigating about 600 cases of maternity care in a probe of hospital failings that may have led to hundreds of baby deaths. Health Secretary Sajid Javid revealed the scope of the police inquiry during a Commons statement on Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust (SaTH). Mistakes at its hospitals led to babies being stillborn, dying after birth or being left badly brain damaged,a major review found on Wednesday. The trust has apologised. Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt of West Mercia Police said its investigation was exploring whether there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved. He said the force had been talking to both medical experts and prosecutors. He added officers' inquiry remained ""very much active"" but no arrests had been made. ""We can reassure the community that when there is an update on our investigation we will share this with the families involved first and foremost and then to the wider public,"" he said. Mr Javid said on Thursday he wanted ""no stone unturned"" in finding those ""responsible for this"". SaTH said it was cooperating fully with West Mercia Police. The major review prompting the police comments was led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden. It examined nearly 1,600 incidents amid parents' fears over safety at the Shropshire trust running Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal Hospital. The cases spanned the years 2000 to 2019, and, on Wednesday, the review concluded catastrophic failures at SaTH may have led to the deaths of nine mothers and more than 200 babies, leaving other infants with major injuries. Detailing repeated mistakes, the report found,external201 babies could have or would have survived if SaTH had provided better care. Rhiannon Davies (left) lost her daughter in 2009 - campaigning by her and others saw the review by Donna Ockenden (right) set up in 2017 On Thursday, Ms Ockenden told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme there was an ""overconfidence""Â in the trust's maternity department. ""They thought they were really good; they were wrong,"" she said. The report highlighted instances of patients being blamed for outcomes, and cases of psychological trauma described as ""harrowing and profound"". They included the following episodes: Before being anaesthetised, a woman who gave birth in 2009 overheard a senior midwife telling a colleague: ""If this baby dies it's on his head."" In 2011, a woman was accused of ""being lazy in labour"" and, as an employee of the trust, was advised against making a complaint A woman with physical disabilities said she was asked by a consultant in 2008 ""how do people like me get pregnant, who would do that to me, and did I know what I was doing""? One woman told the review team that after her daughter's death in 2012, she was given her child and put in a room on the maternity ward where ""we could hear babies crying"" and ""we could hear people being congratulated"". Among the review's conclusions were that the trust was not held to account by external bodies and the reasons for the failures included a lack of staff and ongoing training. Watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC) took until 2018 to rule SaTH's maternity services inadequate, Ms Ockenden told Woman's Hour, saying the vast majority of fatalities examined by her team happened before then. ""There were so many lost opportunities,"" she said. ""In this case of this trust, [the CQC] failed to realise, failed to report, there were very, very significant issues."" Ms Ockenden has made a range of recommendations for SaTH, the wider NHS and the government which include working to deliver safe staffing and giving accurate information to families after poor outcomes. 'We've had to fight all the way for this' Maternity deaths scandal will spark change - Javid Watch on iPlayer: Maternity Scandal - Fighting for the Truth The findings of the Ockenden review are, of course, shocking. Even more alarming is the common thread that runs through this scandal and others. Neglect and abuse at Stafford hospital during the first decade of this century led to the unnecessary suffering and deaths of hundreds of patients, a subsequent inquiry found. Then there was the investigation into University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which uncovered a ""lethal mix of failures"" that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013. Common to all these are poor care, a defensive response by staff and managers and a lack of scrutiny both locally and nationally that failed to uncover the problems for too long. And this is unlikely to be the end of the story. An inquiry into mental health care in Essex between 2000 and 2020 has been launched and there are ongoing investigations into maternity care provided in both Nottingham and Kent. These are all exceptional cases - there is lots of good care in the NHS. But there also seems to be a failure of the culture and systems in the NHS to spot and deal with problems early enough. Emma Priddey said she still struggled with trauma after giving birth to twins in Telford The review was commissioned after two families led a campaign for the inquiry. Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies' daughter Kate died hours after her birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from a Group B Streptococcus infection. SaTH patient Emma Priddey told the BBC she nearly died after giving birth to twins in 2019 at Princess Royal Hospital. She said she was told to continue with a natural birth despite her son being breech, but then had to be rushed for a ""traumatic"" emergency c-section, after which her babies were not breathing. Both, she said, were now ""completely fine"", although the day after her c-section, she added, she collapsed and was given a hysterectomy, leaving her unable to have any more children. ""I live with it daily, daily things trigger me,"" she said. ""The trauma is on another level for myself and my husband."" Louise Barnett, chief executive at SaTH, said: ""We offer our wholehearted apologies for the pain and distress caused by our failings as a trust."" Mr Javid said while there had been systemic failures which needed changing, there had also been individual failures. ""I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,"" he said. Maria Caulfield, minister for patient safety and primary care, told the BBC a ""perfect storm of failure"" had occurred in Shropshire. Questioned about whether successive Conservative governments had done enough to improve maternity services, Ms Caulfield said she recognised there needed to be ""more midwives on the ground"".

"An investment firm founded and part-owned by cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has promised to ditch its shareholdings in Russian companies. Mr Rees-Mogg holds a significant stake in Somerset Capital Management but does not take part in its decisions because he is a government minister. The investment house had stakes in four firms operating in Russia, according to accounts filed in December. It has ditched one of those and is in the process of exiting the others. Companies and public bodies have been under pressure from the government to limit and exit investments in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, still has shareholdings in Somerset Capital Management, according tothe register of members' interests,,externaland continues to receive payouts from it. Sunak faces questions over firm operating in Russia Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia He founded Somerset Capital Management in 2007 but became a sleeping shareholder, with no direct involvement in investment decisions, when he became a minister. The company, which manages investments for institutional clients, had interests in four companies operating in Russia, as of December. These included Yandex, a Russian search engine seen as the country's answer to Google, and Headhunter, a recruitment company based in Cyprus but operating mainly in Russia. Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty has shares in Infosys It also had a large stake in Indian software giant Infosys, which is part-owned by Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty. The company also owned a chunk of Russian natural gas producer Novatek, which it says it has now ditched. In a statement, it said it had written down its ""direct exposure"" to Russia to zero and was seeking to exit its shareholding positions ""in an orderly manner in due course"". A spokesman said: ""Furthermore, we confirm that Somerset will not be making any new investments in Russia. As a global emerging markets equity specialist, most of our portfolios are invested in fast-growing economies including Brazil, South Korea, India and South Africa."" It is not clear how the firm defines ""direct exposure"". Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Even as the government tells other businesses to pull out of Russia, Tory ministers do the opposite - one rule for them, another for everyone else."" She added: ""This sort of behaviour flies in the face of the outpouring of support and solidarity with Ukraine people across our country have shown."" Mr Sunak has faced questions about his wife's shares in Infosys, which was founded by her father, when it emerged the company had kept its Moscow office open. The chancellor has urged UK companies to sever their ties with Russia to punish Vladimir Putin over its invasion of Ukraine. In a video message on Twitter earlier this month, he said: ""While I recognise that it may be challenging to wind down existing investments, I believe there is no argument for new investment in the Russian economy."" He has insisted he has ""nothing to do"" with Infosys. The Indian multinational said it had a ""small team of employees based out of Russia"" that ""services some of our global clients, locally"" and ""supports and advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine"". Earlier this week, public bodies in the UK, such as councils and government departments, were urged to look at how they could go further to sever ties to Russia. Ministers promised legal advice to help public bodies exit contracts voluntarily.

"The priest of the village of Yasnohorodka, near Kyiv, stands inside his destroyed church Ukraine has accused Russia of damaging or destroying at least 59 religious sites across the country since its invasion began. They include an Orthodox cathedral with its steeple ripped apart, a Jewish school struck by shelling, and parish churches left almost totally flattened. Targeting historic monuments and cultural heritage sites is a war crime under international law, according to the Hague Convention. Russia denies targeting civilian infrastructure, but the BBC has identified a number of religious sites that have suffered damage. St Michael's Cathedral was described by Mariupol's tourist office as ""the most beautiful place"" in the city's Left Bank district. Offering ""panoramic views of the Sea of ââAzov, green hills and coastal villages"", the cathedral - opened in 1997 - attracted both worshippers and visitors alike, it said. Before the invasion, St Michael's Cathedral offered views of Mariupol's coastline But after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment on the southern port city, the Orthodox cathedral's crowning dome is now a mangled heap of exposed steel and smashed brickwork. St Michael's Cathedral in Mariupol has suffered heavy damage The cathedral's glass windows have been shattered, and gaping holes have been blown through its red-brick walls. The church's windows are shattered, its dome torn off, and its brickwork blasted apart A church in the small village of Yasnohorodka, about 40km (25 miles) west of Kyiv, has also been hit by shelling, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church says. Priest Romanov of Yasnohorodka stands in front of his church after it was hit by shelling It says two shells struck the dome atop the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin on 5 March, seriously damaging its bell tower. Its windows and doors were also reportedly laced with bullet holes from a heavy-calibre machine gun. Amid heavy fighting, the Russian attack on the village that afternoon alsokilled a priest from another of the village's congregations. The church is littered with debris after its dome was reportedly hit by two shells A Russian shell blew a hole in the roof of a yeshiva, used for religious study, in Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, the city's Jewish community said in a post on its Facebook page. The yeshiva building also functions as a synagogue, a secondary school and a dormitory, the post said. A rocket blew a hole in the roof of a Jewish yeshiva in Kharkiv ""The rocket did not explode but made a large hole in the roof,"" the wife of Kharkiv's chief rabbi, Moshe Moskovitz, told Hebrew-language news site 0404. The strike prompted the head of the World Synagogue Organisation, David Ben-Na'eh, to write to Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, urging him to ask Vladimir Putin to order the Russian military to stop damaging synagogues and holy places. ""Synagogues are a 'little temple' for the Jewish people everywhere. These have been the mainstay of Jews everywhere in the world for thousands of years,"" he wrote, urging Russia to preserve their ""sanctity and integrity"". In an address to Israel's parliament last week, Ukraine's President Zelensky claimed Russia had struck the town of Uman, a site revered by many Hasidic Jews. Mr Zelensky, who is Jewish, said Russian rockets hit the town on the first day of the invasion in February. Tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews travel to Uman every Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement and died in 1810. Tens of thousands of Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish pilgrims visit Uman every year (photo from 2018) Moscow has denied the claim, sharing images of what it said were Ukrainian forces loading arms near a synagogue there. ""I want to underscore that the Russian armed forces do not strike civilian targets as part of the special military operation,"" Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. But Uman's Jewish community has rejected claims about weapons near or in synagogues. ""All synagogues and Jewish sites in Ukraine are used exclusively for their intended purpose, to carry out religious activities or to help members of Jewish communities and the local population,"" the United Jewish Community of Ukraine wrote on its Telegram feed. Some Hasidic Jews have remained in Uman since the invasion began And Irina Rybnitskaya, one of the remaining Jews in Uman,told Israel's Haaretz newspaper,externalthat Moscow's claims were ""not true"". ""Nobody is using synagogues for reasons except for the reasons synagogues should be used,"" she said. One church in the south-eastern city of Volnovakha has suffered severe damage after days of Russian bombardment. The city's Temple of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, built to honour Ukrainian soldiers who died fighting pro-Russian militants in 2014, is in ruins. The church's gold dome is mangled and its woodwork has been shredded. Volnovakha's Temple of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine has been left largely destroyed after days of bombardment Pro-Russian troops patrol near the church in Volnovakha, eastern Ukraine The regional governor of Donetsk has said Volnovakha- once home to some 22,000 people - ""no longer exists"". Satellite images shared by Maxar Technologies, taken before and after the assault, reveal the extent of the damage. Before and after satellite images show the damage inflicted on a church in Volnovakha The devastation of Ukraine's spiritual sites has left many from its religious communities deeply shaken. ""It's a kind of nightmare, I cannot find any words to describe this,"" said Sergiy Berezhnoy, a Kyiv priest from the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. ""It's horrible, it's unhuman,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't know why Russian troops shoot at churches - if we're Christians we should care about peace."" Mr Berezhnoy says he has still been holding small-scale services in his church in the capital amid a curfew and air raids. ""It's a place where people can find help, support,"" he says.

"Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Griffiths spearheaded calls for the inquiry after their daughters' deaths Sweeping changes to maternity services in England are expected after a report laid bare catastrophic failures at an NHS trust that may have led to the deaths of more than 200 babies. Over 20 years, errors at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust led to babies being stillborn, dying after birth or being left severely brain damaged. Health Secretary Sajid Javid apologised to the families affected - and pledged to hold those responsible to account. The trust has also apologised. It said it had already made changes and promised to continue to make improvements. The inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandal - led by senior midwife Donna Ockendon - looked into nearly 1,600 incidents at the trust in Shropshire over two decades. It found: repeated failures in the quality of care at the trust between 2000 and 2019 - with mothers and babies dying or suffering major injuries as a consequence some 201 babies could have survived had the trust provided better care - including 131 stillbirths and 70 neonatal deaths staff were reluctant to perform Caesarean sections leading many babies to die during birth or shortly after, and there was ineffective monitoring of foetal growth in many cases, mothers and babies were left with life-long conditions as a result of their care some babies suffered skull fractures, broken bones or developed cerebral palsy after traumatic forceps deliveries, while others were starved of oxygen and experienced life-changing brain injuries there were significant or major concerns over the care provided in 65 cases of cerebral palsy and 29 severe brain injuries babies' deaths were often not investigated and grieving parents were not listened to, meaning ""failures in care were repeated"" the deaths of nine mothers raised significant or major concerns with the care they received The report also said the trust was not held to account by external bodies - and it either failed to undertake investigations or when an investigation did take place it was inadequate. The reason for the failures included lack of staff, lack of ongoing training, lack of effective investigations and governance and a culture of not listening to the families involved. The trust also had a tendency to blame mothers for poor outcomes - in some cases for their own deaths, the report found. It made a range of recommendations - including more than 60 for the local trust involved, 15 for the wider NHS and three for the government. These included: for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to work with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, (RCOG) and Health Education England to consider how to deliver a sustainable level of obstetric training posts, to enable trusts to deliver safe staffing a proportion of maternity budgets must be ring-fenced for training in every maternity unit for the trust to make the needs of families affected the primary concern during incident investigations a robust process to be in place to ensure that all safety concerns raised by staff at the trust are investigated the trust board must review the progress of the maternity improvement and transformation plan every month the trust must also ensure complete and accurate information is given to families after any poor outcome Mr Javid told MPs the government was accepting all recommendations and ""will act swiftly so no families have to go through the same pain in the future"". He added: ""To all the families who have suffered so greatly, I am sorry. ""The report clearly shows that you were failed by a service that was there you help you and your loved ones to bring life into this world, we will make the changes that the report says are needed at both a local and national level."" Rhiannon Davies (left) lost her daughter in 2009 - campaigning by her and others saw Donna Ockenden's review set up in 2017 The report was the culmination of an inquiry, first launched in 2017, into concerns over maternity care at Shropshire hospitals. Initially set out to examine 23 cases, it has now examined almost 1,600 and is thought to be largest of its kind in NHS history. The findings of the inquiry, Mr Javid said, were ""stark and deeply upsetting"". He told of one case where he said, ""important"" medical information had been kept on Post It notes which were swept into a bin by cleaners which had ""tragic consequences for a newborn baby and her family"". 'We've had to fight all the way for this' Baby death numbers far worse than imagined - Hunt Watch on iPlayer: Maternity Scandal - Fighting for the Truth The health secretary added: ""I'd like to reassure MPs that a number of people who were working at the trust at the time of the incidents have been suspended or struck off from the professional register, and members of senior management have also been removed from their posts. ""There is also an active police investigation, Operation Lincoln, which is looking at around 600 cases."" Det Ch Supt Damian Barratt said the investigation was ""very much active"", although no charges had yet been brought. The findings of the Ockenden review are, of course, shocking. Even more alarming is the common thread that runs through this scandal and others. Neglect and abuse at Stafford hospital during the first decade of this century led to the unnecessary suffering and deaths of hundreds of patients, a subsequent inquiry found. Then there was the investigation into University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which uncovered a ""lethal mix of failures"" that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013. Common to all these are poor care, a defensive response by staff and managers and a lack of scrutiny both locally and nationally that failed to uncover the problems for too long. And this is unlikely to be the end of the story. An inquiry into mental health care in Essex between 2000 and 2020 has been launched and there are ongoing investigations into maternity care provided in both Nottingham and Kent. These are all exceptional cases - there is lots of good care in the NHS. But there also seems to be a failure of the culture and systems in the NHS to spot and deal with problems early enough. This video can not be played Senior midwife Donna Ockenden: New maternity failure reports ""a grave concern"" Two families spearheaded the campaign for the inquiry. Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies's daughter Kate died hours after her birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from a Group B Streptococcus infection. Ms Davies said: ""All we ever wanted was to understand why Kate died. It was as simple as that."" While Mr Stanton said the report was a ""damning account of systemic healthcare failures"". ""There were regulators who should have prevented this, it shouldn't have been left to bereaved families to have uncovered the biggest tragedy in NHS history."" This video can not be played Shropshire baby deaths: Report is a 'gift' to NHS While Mrs Griffiths added: ""It's so important that the learning is taken."" Other families affected have shared their stories, including Julie Rowlings, whose daughter Olivia died in 2002 due to injuries suffered during her birth. ""She had a haematoma the full size of her scalp,"" Ms Rowlings said. ""Her ear was almost severed, her brain stem was almost severed. ""Every major organ haemorrhaged. ""They found brain matter in her lungs, her acid levels were through the roof which meant she was in pain."" Julie Rowlings lost daughter Olivia in 2002 She said the publication of the report meant Olivia ""finally had a voice"". ""She's been heard so it kind of gives her death a purpose and it gives all this pain and anguish which we continually put ourselves through to try and get change a purpose."" Report author Ms Ockenden said hearing the stories had a ""huge impact"" on her and her team. ""There were days where I would go back to my hotel room and cry, I'm not ashamed to say that seeing the distress, seeing the grief, seeing the angerâ¦of so many families that had been torn apart, I sat and cried, more times than I can count,"" she said. Ms Ockenden said the spotlight on maternity services has ""never been greater"" and felt everyone in the system felt the opportunity for change. However, she earlier said she remained ""very concerned that in very recent weeks staff currently working at the trust have contacted the review team to express their concerns about maternity services at the trust in the here and now"". ""No woman should ever have to face going into hospital to give birth and not know whether she and her baby will come out alive,"" Labour shadow health minister Feryal Clark said. A number of health bodies have responded to the inquiry including the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), which said the report's findings were ""appalling"". The NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it deeply regretted the ""horrific experiences these families went through"" and it would work with partners to ensure further improvements are made. Louise Barnett, chief executive at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: ""We offer our wholehearted apologies for the pain and distress caused by our failings as a trust.""

"House prices grew at the fastest annual pace for more than 17 years in March despite the cost of living crisis, according to Nationwide. Annual growth in house prices hit 14.3% in February, the mortgage lender said, the strongest pace since November 2004. The cost of a typical UK home reached a new record high of Â£265,312, rising Â£33,000 in the past year, it said. Prices are being pushed higher by robust demand, limited supply and a strong jobs market, it added. Nationwide, which is one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, said the housing market had ""a surprising amount of momentum given the mounting pressure on household budgets and the steady rise in borrowing costs"". Households in the UK are being squeezed by a cost of living crisis, with prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years as fuel, energy and food costs surge. Mortgage costs are also rising after the Bank of Englandraised interest rates three times in four monthsto try to help lower that price inflation. But these factors have not dampened acceleration in house price growth, Nationwide said. House prices are now more than fifth higher than early 2020 when the pandemic hit. Wales, south-west England and East Anglia saw the highest rates of growth, while London - at 7% - had the lowest rate. ""A combination of robust demand and limited stock of homes on the market has kept upward pressure on prices,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. The UK labour market is strong -job vacancies hit a record high in October last year- and unemployment has continued to fall, which may have helped the housing market, he said. In addition, some people built up ""significant savings"" during lockdowns, which is ""likely to have helped prospective homebuyers raise a deposit"". Despite these factors, Nationwide expects house price growth to slow in the year ahead, due to high inflation rates and interest rate rises. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent body that makes economic forecasts for the government, predicted in October last year that house prices would fall in 2022. It said last week that people in the UK were facing the biggest drop in living standards on recordas wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Many people took stock of how they lived and worked during Covid lockdowns, leading to a race for space among buyers that was fuelled by a stamp duty holiday. In recent months, there has been a shortage of homes on the market to match demand, which has pushed up asking prices. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the housing market was going from ""strength to strength"" but that March ""probably marks the peak for house price growth"". ""For starters, mortgage rates look set to rise further in the coming months,"" she said. ""In addition, we expect housing demand to be hit by a sharp drop in households' real disposable incomes."" The Nationwide's figures came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revised up its UK economic growth estimate for the October to December period last year. It estimated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.3% in the quarter, as opposed to its previous estimate of a 1% increase. As a result, the ONS said the level of GDP was now 0.1% below the pre-Covid period of the final quarter of 2019, compared with its previous estimate of 0.4% below. The ONS figures also indicated that pressures on household finances were leading people to dip into their savings. The household savings ratio dropped to 6.8% in the October-to-December period, down from 7.5% in the previous three months. ""Savings were at their lowest level since the start of the pandemic as household spending rose, mainly driven by rising prices,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics.

Yes please, scriptwriters. England found themselves in a sticky situation early in the game, losing wickets just as they seemed to be gaining momentum. However, Danni Wyatt stuck with it and - having been dropped five times - led England to 293-8 with a superb 129 from 125 balls... England captain Heather Knight:""Really pleased. I think that was a complete performance from us today, what we've been searching for. Really chuffed that the girls have brought their best cricket when it is all on the line. ""The fact we have played knockout cricket for the last four games has helped us as well. Obviously, really excited for Sunday. ""I thought Danni Wyatt was outstanding. She was really selective with the balls she attacked and didn't get frustrated when she found the fielders a little bit. That partnership with Sophia Dunkley really took the game away from them. ""Sophie Ecclestone has been brilliant for us, that's her first five-for in international cricket as well. I thought she bowled outstandingly, her and Charlie Dean in tandem on a wicket that had a little bit in it for them. Really pleased. ""We'll go into the final as underdogs but it's a fresh slate, we're all equal on the morning of the game and what a story has been written for us if we can do it."" South Africa captain Sune Luus:""We didn't have our best fielding performance. They played extremely well today, and all credit to them. But we needed to bring our best performance today, and we didn't, so we are feeling that. ""We needed to be more clinical. It's something we will keep working on but we have had a great campaign, we won't be taking away from that. ""It's a big honour to play in a World Cup and it was an amazing campaign.

It is remarkable to think that not so long ago, England found themselves on the brink of elimination after losing their first three games of the tournament. Five wins later, they are a game away from defending their World Cup crown! No other side have ever made the final having lost their first two games, let alone the first three. This really is some achievement from Heather Knight's side and it could get even better on Sunday. Player-of-the-match Danni Wyatt:""I'm really happy. That was such a complete performance from the girls. Couple of days off now and then we've got to be ready for the final. ""Batting with Dunks was great, she's got such a mature head on young shoulders and I was really happy for her today. We just wanted to run well and be positive. ""I love opening the batting, getting to be positive with just the two fielders out and getting the team off to a good start. ""I've got to dedicate this award to our whole team. We've been together a long time, it's been a long trip, but it's been amazing and I love every one of them."" #bbccricket Jason Cole:Anya Shrubsole put them on the canvas then Sophie Ecclestone knocked them out.

That was some performance by England, they have demolished South Africa and can now look forward to another meeting with Australia - this time in Sunday's World Cup final. Danni Wyatt scored a superb 129, making the most of the Proteas generosity in the field - they dropped her five times - as England racked up 293-8. Anya Shrubsole then took two early wickets to leave South Africa reeling in the chase and they were in deeper trouble by the time Sophie Ecclestone came on and dismantled what remained of their batting order. Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special We didn't think this was possible. England were down and out, had to win all their last games.

"This video can not be played Wyatt's 129 & Ecclestone's six wickets send England into World Cup final Women's World Cup, Christchurch England 293-8 (50 overs):Wyatt 129, Dunkley 60, Ismail 3-46 South Africa 156 (38 overs):Du Preez 30, Ecclestone 6-36, Shrubsole 2-27 England won by 137 runs Scorecard England will face Australia in the final of the Women's World Cup after Danni Wyatt's magnificent century propelled the defending champions to a 137-run defeat of South Africa. Opener Wyatt took advantage of being dropped five times to crash 129 from 125 balls, the backbone of England's 293-8 in Christchurch. She added 116 for the fifth wicket with Sophia Dunkley, who made a measured 60, while Sophie Ecclestone rounded off the innings with 24 from only 11 balls. South Africa's chances of pulling off the largest chase in women's one-day international history largely rested on the dangerous opening pair of Laura Wolvaardt and Lizelle Lee. But Anya Shrubsole, the hero when England beat the same opponents in the semi-finals in 2017, removed both to leave the Proteas 8-2. Spinner Ecclestone, the world's best bowler, then tore through the lower order for her first international five-wicket haul, ending with 6-36 as South Africa were dismissed for 156. It continued a remarkable turnaround from England, who were on the brink of elimination after losing their first three games but have now won five in a row to reach a second successive final. Heather Knight's side will meet the all-powerful Australians at the Hagley Oval on Sunday (02:00 BST) in what promises to be a grandstand finale to a superb tournament. Knight 'so proud' of England making final This video can not be played 'A career-defining innings' - Wyatt survives five drops to make 129 It seemed scarcely believable that England could reach the final when they lost to South Africa,their third defeat of the group stage,on 14 March. Even some of the players have admitted to believing they were out of the tournament. Since then, they have steadily improved, eradicating errors with the ball and in the field, and finding contributions from most of their batters. The resurgence built to this performance in Christchurch, a dismantling of a talented South Africa side that had previously only lost to Australia. For the Proteas, this was a complete contrast from the previous victory over England. Whereas then it was Knight's side who missed chances in the field, this time it was South Africa who looked affected by the pressure of the occasion. It meant South Africa once again lost in a global semi-final - they have been beaten in all three of their 50-over World Cup last-four ties to go along with two losses at the same stage in the T20 version. The making of England's world number one, Sophie Ecclestone Wyatt has had a nomadic 12-year international career. Originally picked as an off-spinner, she has been moved up and down the batting order and was dropped during the World Cups of 2013 and 2017. However, after being promoted to open earlier in this tournament, she enjoyed her finest hour, making her highest score in an ODI when England needed it most. The five drops were of varying difficulty, but the chances missed by Marizanne Kapp at mid-wicket when Wyatt was on 36, then by Lara Goodall at deep mid-wicket on 77, were particularly poor. The other drops came when Wyatt had 22, 116 and 117. In between, the right-hander slashed through the off side and hustled between the wickets. When England found themselves 126-4 in the 26th over, they were in a parlous position, only for Wyatt and Dunkley to combine in a brave counter-attack. And, after South Africa finally held a Wyatt miscue to short third, Ecclestone's cameo pushed England out of sight. While Ecclestone's figures are eye-catching, it was Shrubsole who effectively ended the South Africa chase before it started. Shrubsole took England to victory in the final and semi-final five years ago, anddragged them over the line with the bat against New Zealand earlier in this tournament.Here, she tumbled to hold Wolvaardt off her own bowling, then had Lee turn a catch to mid-wicket. Left-armer Ecclestone was held back until the 24th over, by which time South Africa were already four wickets down. And, with the lower order exposed, Ecclestone took all of the remaining wickets on offer with her trademark bounce, guile and accuracy. Kapp and Mignon du Preez were bowled, Chloe Tryon, Shabnim Ismail and Masabata Klaas chipped catches and Trish Chetty was stumped by yards to become the last to fall. As Ecclestone grabbed the match ball and Wyatt was named player of the match, some England players were in tears of joy. Only Australia stand in their way of a complete turnaround and another world title. England captain Heather Knight:""I'm really pleased. I think that was a complete performance from us today, what we've been searching for. ""The fact we have played knockout cricket for the last four games has helped us as well. ""We'll go into the final as underdogs but it's a fresh slate, we're all equal on the morning of the game and what a story has been written for us if we can do it.""

"Nandan Kumar is a software developer based in Bangalore A man says he was forced to hack into a domestic Indian airline's website to find his missing luggage. Nandan Kumar, 28, called IndiGo - a low-cost carrier - for help, after realising that he had swapped his bag with a co-passenger. But after IndiGo refused to help him trace the other person, Mr Kumar said he was able to retrieve information about him from the airline website. IndiGo told the BBC that ""at no point was the IndiGo website compromised"". Mr Kumar says he's not a professional hacker, but had to ""do something"" to retrieve his luggage. In a series of tweets, Mr Kumar, a software engineer, said by the time he got to the airport luggage belt, a co-passenger had taken his bag and left. He told the BBC he only realised the mistake after getting home, because both bags looked exactly alike. He was able to identify the other person's Passenger Name Record number or PNR through a luggage tag, but when he called the airline to ask for information about the passenger, they refused to help, citing privacy and data protection rules. Mr Kumar's suitcase (R) and his co-passenger's one (L) looked alike In a statement sent to the BBC, IndiGo said their ""customer care team followed protocol by not sharing any other passenger's contact details with another passenger. This is in line with our data privacy policies."" ""The agent assured me that they would call me back when they are able to reach this person,"" Mr Kumar said. ""But the call never came."" In a statement sent to the BBC, IndiGo airlines said that ""attempts were made by the customer care team to facilitate the exchange of baggage, but it could not be completed as the calls went unanswered."" The next morning, Mr Kumar says he decided to ""take matters"" into his own hands. He started digging into IndiGo's website using his co-passenger's PNR, in the hope of finding an address or a phone number. He tried various methods - using the check-in process, by editing the booking and updating the contact. But none of it worked. ""After all failed attempts, my developer instinct kicked in and I pressed the F12 button on my computer keyboard and opened the developer console on the IndiGo website,"" Mr Kumar said. ""I thought 'let me check the network logs'."" What he found was surprising - his co-passenger's phone number. ""To be frank, I only checked for a phone number or an email. Basically anything I could use to get in touch to retrieve my bag."" He says, however, that the system's data should have been encrypted, adding that it allowed anyone to access private information. ""A PNR and a last name is very easy to get. People share their boarding passes. Anyone can see your bags, take a picture and later use it get your information,"" Mr Kumar says. But it all ended well for Mr Kumar and his bag. He called his fellow passenger with the phone number he had retrieved from the system logs, and the two met up to swap their luggage.

"Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping at a meeting in Brazil in 2019 China should not become ""too closely aligned"" with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, the head of UK cyber-intelligence GCHQ has warned. Sir Jeremy Fleming said China's long-term interests are not served by an alliance with Moscow. In a rare public address during a visit to Australia, Sir Jeremy also said Russia had ""massively misjudged"" the situation in Ukraine. He said Vladimir Putin's advisers are ""afraid to tell him the truth"". Putin advisers too scared to tell him truth - US US warns China against helping Russia in Ukraine Ukraine War: Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Why has Putin invaded? Sir Jeremy said China's aspirations to become a leading player on the global stage were ""not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores"" international rules. The speech at the Australian National University in Canberra comes after Downing Street saidBoris Johnson had a ""frank and candid"" discussion,externalwith China's President Xi Jinping last week. Sir Jeremy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a clear ""strategic choice"" to align with China as it grows more powerful in opposition to the United States. He said the Kremlin regards China in the current crisis as a supplier of weapons, technology, and a potential market for its oil and gas. GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming was speaking in Australia But Sir Jeremy suggested President Xi has a ""more nuanced"" view of the relationship. ""Russia understands that, long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation."" Meanwhile,echoing comments from US and Ukrainian officials,the GCHQ boss said Mr Putin ""underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. ""He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory.""

"Ms Cheng worked for state broadcaster CGTN prior to her detention A Beijing court is holding a closed-door trial for Australian journalist and former TV anchor Cheng Lei, in a high-profile diplomatic case. Ms Cheng is accused of illegally supplying state secrets overseas. Her family maintains she is innocent. The Chinese-born Australian was working for Chinese state media outlet CGTN prior to her detention in August 2020. Canberra has repeatedly raised concerns over her detention and has called for ""basic standards of justice"" to be met. Little is known about the exact nature of Ms Cheng's alleged offences and it's not clear when a verdict will be handed down. Speaking to reporters outside of the courtroom on Thursday, Australia's ambassador to China Graham Fletcher said he and other Australian officials had been denied entry into the hearing. Chinese courts often bar outsiders from trials deemed politically sensitive. ""This is deeply concerning, unsatisfactory and regrettable. We can have no confidence in the validity of the process which is conducted in secret,"" he said, adding that Australia would continue to ""advocate strongly for Ms Cheng Lei's rights and interests"". Ms Cheng, who was previously reported to have suffered ill health while in detention, was now ""doing okay"" considering the circumstances, said Mr Fletcher. Ms Cheng's lawyer had also told Australian media that she was in good health and good spirits. Cheng Lei: Who is the Australian TV anchor detained by China? Mr Fletcher added that Australia has requested that Ms Cheng be allowed to speak to her children. ""They haven't had any contact with their mother since the detention,"" he said. A family statement released to Reuters on Wednesday said her children and elderly parents ""miss her immensely and sincerely hope to reunite with her as soon as possible"". Prior to her detention, Ms Cheng had worked in Beijing for several years. Many of her family members, including her two young children, live in Australia. In August 2020, she suddenly disappeared from television and could not be contacted by friends or relatives. Her employer, CGTN - the English-language channel of the state broadcaster - also wiped its websites of Ms Cheng's profile page and work. China initially announced she was being held on national security grounds, and in February last year authorities formally arrested Ms Cheng on spying charges. Her family have said they have no idea why she had been detained. Australia said its representatives had been able to visit her once a month - in line with the bilateral consular agreement with China. Relations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years, leading to diplomatic and trade ructions. Analysts say this has made it harder for Australian authorities to negotiate with Beijing over their citizens' release. Beijing has arrested or expelled a number of journalists in recent times. Shortly after Ms Cheng's arrest, the last two Australian media correspondents in China fled the country following consular advice.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that shelling of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol will only end when Ukrainian troops surrender. Mr Putin made the comments during an hour long phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday night, the Kremlin said in a statement. But French officials said the Russian leader had agreed to consider plans to evacuate civilians from the city. Russia later proposed a one-day ceasefire for Thursday. The defence ministry said the ceasefire would start at 10:00 local time (08:00 BST) and would allow people to travel westwards to Zaporizhzhia via the Russian-controlled port of Berdyansk. On Thursday morning, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy of Ukrainian buses was on its way to Mariupol to try to evacuate civilians. She said the International Committee of the Red Cross had confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor to the city. Previous attempts to establish a ceasefire in Mariupol have collapsed amid accusations of bad faith from both sides. Russia has also been accused offorcibly relocating thousands of civiliansto Russia or Russian-controlled areas. The announcement comes as new satellite photos showed the destruction caused by the shelling. The images, released by the Earth observation company Maxar, showed that residential areas have been reduced to rubble and highlighted Russian artillery cannons in firing positions on the outskirts of the city. Officials from France's ElyseÃ© palace called the situation in the city ""catastrophic"" and added that ""civilian populations must be protected and must leave the city if they wish to. They must have access to food aid, water and the medicines they need"". ""This very degraded humanitarian situation is linked to the siege of the city by the Russian armed forces,"" the statement said. France, along with Turkey, Greece and several humanitarian groups, have presented Mr Putin with a plan to evacuate the city. Officials said that Mr Putin told Mr Macron that he will ""think about"" the proposal. But in its readout of the call, the Kremlin appeared to suggest that Mr Putin has provided no such assurances. Russian officials said Mr Putin told the French leader that ""in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city, Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms"". The statement added that Mr Putin had given Mr Macron ""detailed information about measures taken by the Russian military to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and ensure the safe evacuation"" of civilians from the besieged south-eastern city. Ukraine has accused Russia offorcibly relocating thousands of peoplefrom Mariupol to Russian-held territory. Russian artillery positions on the periphery of Mariupol The call followed claims by the mayor of Mariupol that thousands of people have been killed during the Russian bombardment of the port city. Vadym Boychenko, who has been evacuated from the city, told the Reuters news agency that almost 5,000 people, including around 210 children, have been killed since Russian shelling began. Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine, told Reuters that she believes ""there could be thousands of deaths, civilian casualties, in Mariupol"". The International Red Cross humanitarian organisation has confirmed reports that one of its warehouses in the city has been hit by Russian shelling, telling the BBC that all supplies in the depot had already been distributed. It added that it no longer has ""a team on the ground"" and therefore could not comment on potential extent of casualties or damage. Are you or your family in Mariupol?

"US President Joe Biden has ordered a major release of oil from America's reserves in an effort to bring down high fuel costs. The release of up to 180m barrels of oil over six months is the largest since the reserve was created in 1974. Oil prices dropped on reports of the move, which is aimed at easing a supply crunch sparked by war in Ukraine. But the release - of about 1m barrels a day - is unlikely to fully resolve the energy crisis, analysts say. Mr Biden promised further action to boost US output, saying the release would ""serve as [a] bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up"". He called for companies to pay extra if they choose not to use oil wells on land they lease from the government, as well as investments to speed up the adoption of greener energy sources. The perils of rising gas prices for Biden Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Following Mr Biden's remarks, US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate was more than 7% lower at about $100 a barrel, while Brent Crude fell roughly 5.4% to around $107. The soaring cost of fuel has become a major political issue around the world, including in the US, which hosts mid-term elections in November. Mr Biden said the scale of the release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - which together amounts to less than two days of global consumption - was ""unprecedented"". America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created following the energy crisis in the 1970s It is located in storage caverns in salt domes along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana The reserves held about 568m barrels as of 25 March, down from more than 700m at their peak in 2009 The International Energy Agency has forecast consumption of more than 100m barrels per day of petroleum and liquid fuels this year Thursday's announcement marked the third time in six months Mr Biden has moved to draw down America's crude oil stockpiles But the release of additional reserves is unlikely to be enough to compensate for lost supplies from Russia - the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. ""While stock releases will help to keep a lid on prices in the short term, we think it will take an increase in global production to spark a sustained fall in prices,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - hit $139 a barrel earlier this monthafter Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions slapped on Moscow by the US and its allies. Energy prices have fallen back since then, but oil is still almost 70% higher than it was a year ago. Analysis by Samira Hussain, BBC News reporter It makes for an excellent headline: President Biden releases unprecedented amounts of oil from strategic reserves. But it really only offers a temporary fix to global shortages. So why is the White House even bothering? Domestically, the President is under a tremendous amount of pressure. November is the midterm elections and Democrats hold a very slim majority that they are desperate to hold on to. Rising inflation was already an issue, and Republicans have been laying the blame for the high cost of living on the White House and specifically Mr Biden. The record high cost of fuel just adds to the pain being felt by the American middle class. And it certainly doesn't jive well with the president's ""Joe from Scranton"" vibe. Global demand for energy had been rising prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to reopen as coronavirus lockdown measures were relaxed. However, the war in Ukraine has raised fears of supply issues, with warnings that Russian oil exports could fall by as much as 3m barrels a day. Most major energy-producing nations are either at full capacity or are unwilling to increase output. On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies, including Russia, confirmed they were sticking to their existing deal to gradually increase production. The decision came despite pressure from the US, UK and others on members of the group of oil producing nations to boost output. ""The consensus on the outlook pointed to a well-balanced market,"" the group said. ""Current volatility is not caused by fundamentals, but by ongoing geopolitical developments."" The International Energy Agency (IEA) has called an emergency meeting but it is unclear whether other countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Japan, will follow the US by releasing oil reserves. Mr Biden said he was coordinating with Western nations on the release of the stockpiles and expected them to release another 30 to 50 million barrels. Also on Thursday, Japan said that it would take emergency measures to secure supplies of seven strategic materials it relies on heavily from Russia or Ukraine as the war and sanctions cause disruptions to supplies. The country's industry minister said the actions include government support to boost domestic production, alternative procurement and to help technological developments to reduce use of the materials, which include liquefied natural gas and gases used in computer chip-making.
