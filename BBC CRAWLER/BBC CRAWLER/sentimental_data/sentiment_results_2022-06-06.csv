"Firefighters suffered heavy loss of life in the blaze, and some are still missing Bangladeshi officials have accused the operator of a container depot of exacerbating a deadly blaze by not storing chemicals safely. Nine firefighters were among more than 40 people killed after fire broke out near the port city of Chittagong. Officials said containers of hydrogen peroxide were labelled incorrectly - and firefighters doused flames with water instead of foam. The depot's owner has yet to comment on the allegations. On Monday, officials revised down the initial death toll from 49 to 41, saying some bodies had been counted twice. Hundreds of people were injured or are still missing in the disaster at BM Container Depot in Sitakunda, 40km (25 miles) from Chittagong, and the number of dead is expected to rise. This video can not be played Watch: Fire crews try to bring the fire under control at the container depot in Chittagong, Bangladesh Purnachandra Mutsuddi, an assistant director with the local firefighting service, told the AFP news agency that as soon as the firefighters entered the depot on Saturday they unwittingly doused the hydrogen peroxide with water, setting off an explosive reaction that sent ""a container flying more than 500 feet"". ""There are some rules to keep hydrogen peroxide. Had we known this, we would never throw water. We would never take our vehicle inside the depot,"" he said. The fire, which has now been blazing for three days, is under control but has not been extinguished completely. Local police chief Abul Kalam Azad said that an investigation into the causes of the blaze had begun. The chemical stockpile exploded with devastating consequences It remains unclear what sparked the blaze, which injured about 300 people, more than 12 of whom are in a critical condition. Two firefighters are among the missing. People seeking news of those unaccounted for have converged on the local hospital in Chittagong, some holding photos of their loved ones. Jahanara Begum was waiting to give a sample for DNA testing to identify the remains of her son, Shahadat Hossain, who was a lorry driver. ""His father just died last year, now I have lost my son,"" she told BBC Bengali. ""He parked his truck and went to the canteen for dinner. The canteen caught fire and my son got trapped."" Shahadat Hossain had been in the canteen when fire broke out The family of Imran Hossain Mazumdar identified his body on Monday afternoon. He had been one of the first firefighters on the scene. Mr Mazumdar leaves behind a wife who is six months pregnant, a son and a disabled daughter, his niece said. Police spokesperson Shanewaz Khaled said it could take weeks to identify the deceased. ""If someone is missing from the fire, the families can give their samples to us,"" he told BBC Bengali. Officials had collected 23 samples for DNA testing so far, he said. The fire broke out at around 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Saturday and hundreds of firefighters, police and volunteers quickly arrived on the scene. As they tried to extinguish the blaze a huge explosion rocked the site, engulfing many of the rescuers in flames and throwing debris and people into the air. ""The explosion just threw me some 10 metres from where I was standing. My hands and legs are burnt,"" lorry driver Tofael Ahmed told AFP news agency. The blast was so large it was heard several kilometres away and shattered the windows of nearby buildings. One local shopkeeper told reporters that a piece of debris had flown half a kilometre and landed in his pond. He described seeing ""fireballs falling like rain"" after the explosion.

"Elon Musk has threatened to walk away from his $44bn takeover of Twitter, accusing the social media company of ""thwarting"" his requests to learn more about its user base. In a letter filed with regulators, Mr Musk said he was entitled to do his own measurement of spam accounts. The letter formalises a dispute that has simmered for weeks after Mr Musk declared the deal ""on hold"" pending further information. Twitter has defended its estimates. But Mr Musk has said he believes spam and fake accounts represent a far greater share than the less than 5% of daily users that Twitter reports publicly. ""As Twitter's prospective owner, Mr Musk is clearly entitled to the requested data to enable him to prepare for transitioning Twitter's business to his ownership and to facilitate his transaction financing. To do both, he must have a complete and accurate understanding of the very core of Twitter's business model - its active user base,"" lawyer Mike Ringler wrote in the letter. ""Based on Twitter's behaviour to date, and the company's latest correspondence in particular, Mr Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights,"" the letter said. ""This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement."" The dispute has raised more doubts about the future of the takeover, which Twitter's board approved in April. ""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" the company said in a statement. Twitter, which has said Mr Musk waived typical rights to due diligence in his eagerness to clinch the deal, added that it intended to complete the takeover at the agreed price and terms. Mr Musk, who faces a $1bn break-up fee and possible lawsuit if he opts out, first raised the issue of the spam accounts on social media last month, saying the deal was on hold but he remained committed to the acquisition. Twitter hits back on Musk doubts over fake accounts Elon Musk puts $44bn Twitter deal on hold Twitter investor sues Elon Musk over takeover bid Analysts have said the Tesla boss might be using the issue to try to renegotiate the price or even walk away. They said Mr Musk's decision to raise the issue on social media was unconventional, making it difficult to establish how serious he was. When Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal defended the company's process in a series of tweets, Mr Musk responded with a poo emoji. Mr Musk has said he believes that bots could account for 20% or more of Twitter users. The letter, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, confirms that the two sides have gone back and forth on the issue since early May. It says Mr Musk merits ""reasonable cooperation"" as he tries to line up financing for the deal. ""Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr Musk's data requests,"" the letter says. ""Twitter's effort to characterise it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue."" Texas attorney general Ken Paxton entered the debate on Monday, saying he had launched an investigation into Twitter for ""potentially false reporting over its fake bot accounts"". Twitter has until 27 June to respond to his request for information. Mr Musk's plans for the company have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, while raising some alarm among investors of electric car company Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, which Mr Musk also leads. He has lined up outside investors to help pay for the takeover and is also using equity and loans backed by his Tesla shares, which have been hit in recent weeks as market turmoil wipes billions from the values of companies including Tesla. The decline has also made Mr Musk's offer of $54.20 per share for Twitter look even more generous. On Monday, Twitter shares were trading below $39, down 3%, though they later regained some ground. They have yet to return to the highs they hit last month shortly after Mr Musk revealed he had purchased about 9% of the firm's shares. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the letter marked the ""strongest signal yet that the Tesla founder is prepared to walk away"". ""This is a move Twitter investors have for weeks been steeling themselves for: the moment when Elon Musk's haphazard ruminations in tweets have been distilled into an official letter to regulators,"" she said. ""However, given the added volatility which has hit the tech sector since Mr Musk made his offer, it's highly likely he's after a cheaper price even if Twitter does provide the data requested in support of its initial analysis.""

"Shoppers are spending less than they were a year ago, as the rising cost of living squeezes incomes, according to the body representing retailers. Sales, in-store and online, fell for the second month in a row in May, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. Sales rose sharply last year after pandemic restrictions eased, but that ""spending bubble"" has now burst, the BRC's Helen Dickinson said. Total retail sales in May declined by 1.1% compared to May 2021. That was a sharper slowdown than in April, when BRC figures showed a fall of 0.3% compared to April 2021. Sales of clothing, footwear and accessories, including in fashion and beauty, rose, as people prepared for holidays and summer social occasions, including the Jubilee. But consumers were not buying bigger ticket items, such as furniture and electronics, the BRC said, as it published its latest monthly data, which it collects from the UK's medium and larger retailers. With inflation running at historic highs, what people are buying is costing them more. So a small drop in total sales masks a much larger drop in the volume of goods sold, once inflation is accounted for, the BRC added. ""It is clear the post-pandemic spending bubble has burst, with retailers facing tougher trading conditions, falling consumer confidence, and soaring inflation impacting consumers' spending power,"" said Ms Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive. Why are prices rising so quickly? M&S shifts from town centres as online sales grow Have the lockdown success stories lost their shine? The fall in May marks the second consecutive month of declining retail sales, as reported by the regular BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor. It comes at a difficult time for retailers, who are also facing rising costs, especially of energy, transport and labour,which combined were ""forcing retailers to increase their prices"", Ms Dickinson added. The share of sales that take place online, as opposed to in physical stores, appeared to have stabilised, the BRC added. After rising sharply while pandemic restrictions were in place, online sales were ""settling"" at around 39%, compared to 30% pre-pandemic, the BRC said. ""Retailers will be hoping that a post-Jubilee and summer feel-good factor begins to improve confidence amongst some shoppers - as presently overall confidence levels are lower than sales may suggest,"" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG. Julie Abraham, chief executive of home entertainment retailer Richer Sounds, said: ""It's tough out there for everybody. ""We've seen a definite slowdown and we're having to work that much harder to give better value than ever,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. She added that shoppers were ""far more savvy now and looking round for a good bargain"". ""So whereas sometimes it might have been more of an impulse purchase, nowadays they're looking very carefully at what they want to buy."" Over the four-day Jubilee bank holiday weekend, people did spend significantly more than the equivalent dates last year (which did not include a bank holiday) data from Barclaycard on Monday suggested. ""Despite wider concerns around the cost of living, the hospitality sector especially will be pleased by this welcome boost, having missed out on two years of unrestricted trading,"" said Barclaycard Payments chief executive Rob Cameron. Spending at restaurants rose 41.5%  over 2-5 June. Spending was up 74.2% at pubs, bars and night clubs, while spending on entertainment was up 67.3% and spending on public transport was up 38.8%, Barclaycard Payments said, based on credit and debit card transactions.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared a picture of their daughter Lilibet after celebrating her first birthday. Lilibet is seen smiling at a birthday picnic hosted by the couple at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. Prince Harry and Meghan said they were ""incredibly touched"" by birthday wishes they received for their second child, who was named in honour of the Queen. It comes after theyvisited the UK for the Platinum Jubilee. On Friday, the Sussexes made their first public appearance in Britain together since 2020when they attended a service of thanksgiving for the Queen at St Paul's Cathedral. The couple were alsopictured watching Trooping the Colour from a window, but were not part of the carriage procession or the group of working royals and their children permitted on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Last week, was the first opportunity for the 96-year-old monarch to meet her great-grandaughter, who was born in Santa Barbara, California, where the Sussexes now liveafter stepping back as senior working royals. But there has been no confirmation whether or not the Queen has met Lilibet. Lilbet has inherited the copper locks of the Duke of Sussex, who is pictured aged one with his father, the Prince of Wales Lilibet,who celebrated her first birthday on Saturday, is pictured dressed in a pale blue frock with a white bow in her hair. The photo was taken by a family friend Misan Harriman at a picnic attended by family and close friends, a spokesperson for the duke and duchess said. Royals wish Lilibet a happy first birthday Harry and Meghan navigate a tricky return to duty Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? Professional photographer Mr Harriman latershared a black and white snap on Twitter,externalof Meghan holding Lilibet alongside the words: ""It was such a privilege to celebrate the 1st birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers! Joy and face painting all around."" Mr Harriman previously tookblack-and-white photographs of Meghan and Harrywhen they announced she was pregnant with their second child. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who are pictured with the Princess Royal's daughter, Zara Tindall, attended a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee Celebrations A spokesperson for the Sussexes said cake was also served at the picnic by thecouple's wedding baker Claire Ptak. They added that more than $100,000 (Â£79,800) worth of donations had been made in their daughter's honour by people around the globe to World Central Kitchen - an organisation providing meals for those affected by humanitarian, climate and community crises. The timing of the release of this photograph seems to be part of Prince Harry and Meghan's determined efforts to keep a low profile during their Platinum Jubilee visit. Lilibet's birthday was on Saturday, but the picture wasn't made public until Monday night, when the Jubilee weekend was over and when there could beno accusations of stealing the limelight from the Queen. There are also no details of which family were there for the birthday party, which fitted in with Buckingham Palace's earlier position that any such family meetings would remain private, including any meeting with the Queen. It's a difficult balancing act for Prince Harry and Meghan, with such intense and fiercely divided public interest surrounding them. They're likely to be criticised if they seem to be courting attention, and blamed if they hide away. And over the Jubilee celebrations they appeared at the St Paul's thanksgiving service, but otherwise stayed below the radar. With this latest photo, they kept their own news out of the spotlight until after the Queen's big weekend. Prince Harry and Meghan named Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the toddler's great-grandmother. Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, the couple said at the time of her birth last year. Allow Twitter content?

"As they hid under the pews, many worshippers were shot in their legs Grace was being shared when the first shot rang out. For dozens of worshippers at the St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, south-western Nigeria, the Lord's prayer turned into a viaticum - the final prayer. The armed men that burst through the church doors around 11:30 on Sunday set off dynamite that had congregants scampering to escape the explosions. As worshipers rushed for the other two exits in the chaos, they were met by more armed men, followed by more shots and loud bangs. At the end, eyewitnesses say at least 50 bodies - some of them children - were left strewn across the church floors, while many more were injured. There was blood on the altar, blood on the floor, bodies on the pews. It is still not clear how many people have died and or were injured. But the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo says the church, which is one of the biggest parishes in Ondo state, can hold up to 1,200 people. It was full at the time of the attack. This video can not be played A local resident describes how he was informed of his brother's death ""They killed to their satisfaction before leaving,"" chorister John Nwovu told the BBC. He hid in the sacristy with others while the attack - which lasted for around 30 minutes - was going on and said he was only saved by God's grace. An explosion blew up the ceiling above him, burying him and several others, he said. They bore the weight and pain in silence while the killers went about, picking off worshippers hiding under the pews. Mr Nwovu's brother, also a chorister, was shot in the leg and is recovering in hospital. ""I don't think the shock of what I saw will leave me for the rest of my life,"" he said. Dynamite residue still litters the church, while the vestry - where many hid - bears testimony to the chaos. Shoes, bible pages soaked in blood, purses and other personal belongings are still scattered about. For members of this quiet community in Ondo state, the church was more than a place of worship - it has been a part of their lives since birth. This photo was taken inside the church after the attack This was a surprise attack. Owo is relatively peaceful and has been spared the wanton killings that seem to happen weekly across Nigeria. Attacks on churches have happened before - it was a tactic of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, but the gruesomeness of this attack has shocked many. This was a congregation of the aged and the very young. Worshippers had turned up in their Sunday best for the Pentecost service, which marks the birth of the church and official end of the Easter season. ""I saw entire families being wiped away, friends, relatives, those I knew,"" said Mr Nwovu. For orthodox Nigerian Christians, first Sundays of the month are also significant. They are usually full of colourful thanksgivings led by families and parish groups and this would have been no different. Folake Oni, 56, doesn't remember how she survived the attack. She only recalls exiting the church and being taken to hospital. Her daughter Elizabeth Ademiluka told the BBC that her mother was traumatized but physically well. On Monday, a sombre mood engulfed the town, with hundreds of anxious people at the hospitals and dozens more at the church. People are walking about with a blank stare, wondering how their lives have changed forever. There is still a crowd at two local hospitals where volunteers rushed to donate blood after the attack. But more is still needed, said Nigeria's medical association, which has urged people to donate more at local hospitals. Everyone seems to know someone inside the hospital where many are critically injured and some are fighting for their lives. Many of the survivors at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Owo have been shot in both legs, some might never walk again. There is a palpable outrage, plenty of which has spilled onto social media, where people followed the attack with shock as it happened. The pictures are too gory for many Nigerians, even those numbed by the numerous deaths witnessed in the country. Some of the children killed were unrecognisable - the high-calibre bullets scattered flesh and bones, a medical worker at the FMC told the BBC. ""The audacity of Nigeria to take my parents from me. I will always hate this country!!!!! It's a promise!,"" saidone Twitter user,external. The outrage over the killings has been further exacerbated by pictures of President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and other members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) eating at a state dinner hosted by the president, hours after the attack. In one of the pictures, the politicians dressed in colourful robes are smiling. A convention to elect the party's presidential candidate for next year's general elections is underway in Abuja.

Mr Buhari has released a statement condemning the attack, an action many Nigerians are now used to, given the frequency of such killings. ""Only fiends from the nether region"" could have done this ""dastardly act"", the statement read. Elected on promises to end insecurity, Nigeria's security challenges have worsened under Mr Buhari, who is winding down to his tenure's end next May. Armed gangs which operate across the country are rarely brought to book and no-one has any hopes that the killers of Owo will pay for the atrocity. All eyes are now on the state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, who has vowed to hunt down the killers. This incident will feel personal for Mr Akeredolu, as he comes from Owo. He is one of the southern governors who have been very critical of the activities of herdsmen, who generally come from the north, and open grazing in Nigeria. He caused a huge furore last year when he ordered them to leave the forests in the state, accusing them of criminality. There is nothing that links herders to the church attack, who are easily scapegoated for such killings. However, they have been accused of similar attacks in the past, especially in central Nigeria, where the conflict between herders and farmers for land has been especially fierce. The killers wore khaki trousers used by many of Nigeria's many paramilitary groups, said Mr Nwovu, so they could have been anyone. The attack comes exactly a week after the head of the Methodist Church in Nigeria was abducted, along with two other clerics in the south-east of the country, and freed after paying $240,000 (Â£190,000). Also, two weeks ago, two Catholic priests were kidnapped in Katsina, President Buhari's home state in the north of the country. They have not been released. This might feel like a new wave of attacks on the church, and worshippers like Mr Nwovu are shaken. ""I can't go back to church with what I saw, for now,"" he said.

"Atul Gupta with South African president Jacob Zuma in 2011 Two brothers from the wealthy Gupta family have been arrested in the United Arab Emirates, the South African and Emirati authorities have announced. Atul and Rajesh Gupta are accused in South Africa of profiting from their close links with former president Jacob Zuma and exerting unfair influence. Extradition talks are taking place between the two countries. The brothers fled South Africa after a judicial commission began probing their involvement in corruption in 2018. They are accused of paying financial bribes in order to win lucrative state contracts and influence powerful government appointments. They deny any wrongdoing. A statement from Dubai Police said the two men were being held ""in connection with money laundering and criminal charges in South Africa"". The force said it acted after receiving an Interpol ""red notice"" - a request to law enforcement organisations to provisionally arrest a wanted person pending extradition. A third brother, Ajay, is also wanted by the South African authorities, but it is not clear why he was not arrested. The Gupta family moved from India to South Africa in 1993. They also face accusations of money laundering in India, where tax officials raided properties belonging to them in 2018 in multiple cities, including their company office in capital Delhi. Many of the most serious corruption allegations levelled against the Indian-born brothers focus on their relationship with Jacob Zuma, who was president of South Africa from 2009 until he was forced to step down amid a storm of corruption allegations nine years later. The Gupta family is accused of using their close links with Mr Zuma to wield enormous political power across all levels of South African government - winning business contracts, influencing high-profile government appointments and misappropriating state funds. Mr Zuma, along with the Guptas, denies the allegations. After the brothers fled the country, South Africa negotiated an extradition treaty with the UAE in 2021. President Cyril Ramaphosa's government has said it hoped the agreement would lead to the return of the Guptas to face charges, but it was not immediately clear following the arrests whether the brothers would return to South Africa. More about the Guptas in South Africa: South Africa and the fable of the missing Guptas Who are the Guptas? How the Guptas' brand turned toxic Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma The Gupta family became so closely linked with Mr Zuma that a joint term was even coined for them - ""the Zuptas"". One of Mr Zuma's wives, as well as a son and daughter, worked in senior roles for Gupta-controlled companies. Many of the companies in the Gupta portfolio profited from lucrative contracts with government departments and state-owned corporations - where public officials say they were directly instructed by the family to take decisions that would advance the brothers' business interests. It is alleged that compliance was rewarded with money and promotion, while disobedience was punished with dismissal. The list of public bodies accused of having been ""captured"" is extensive - the ministries of finance, natural resources and public enterprises, as well as agencies responsible for tax collection and communications, the national broadcaster SABC, the national carrier, South African Airways, the state-owned rail-freight operator and the energy giant Eskom - one of the largest utility companies on the planet. A four-year investigation later published by the country's top judge concluded that the brothers had become deeply embedded in the highest levels of government and Mr Zuma's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party. Reports published this year by investigators accused the brothers of being linked to racketeering activity through the procurement of rail, ports and pipeline infrastructure. Its authors also concluded that Mr Zuma ""would do anything that the Guptas wanted him to do for them"". Last year, Mr Zuma was imprisoned for 15 months for refusing to testify before the same investigators. He was released on parole after serving two months of his sentence in jail. Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta moved to South Africa from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 1993, just as white-minority rule was ending. It is said that when Atul arrived to set up the family business, Sahara Computers, he was amazed by the lack of red tape. They grew the company to employ more than 10,000 people in South Africa, also developing financial interests in the mining, air travel, energy, technology and media sectors. Atul Gupta said he met Mr Zuma before he became president ""when he was a guest in one of Sahara's annual functions"".

"Dom Phillips talking to two indigenous men in Roraima State, Brazil in 2019 The family of veteran British journalist Dom Phillips is urging more action be taken to find him after he went missing in the Brazilian Amazon. Mr Phillips, 57, disappeared along with Brazilian indigenous expert Bruno AraÃºjo Pereira in a remote rainforest area while researching a book. The two had received threats days before vanishing on Sunday morning, say indigenous rights groups. Both men have deep knowledge of the region. Forty-one-year-old Bruno Pereira, who is currently on leave from his post with the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, is an expert on isolated tribes in the Amazon. Mr Phillips has been living in Brazil for more than a decade and is a long-time contributor to Britain's Guardian newspaper as well as other publications such as the Financial Times and the Washington Post. He has written extensively about the threats facing the Amazon, includinghow cattle farming is fuelling an environmental crisis,externalandhow illegal gold miners encroach on indigenous territory,external. Two indigenous rights groups sounded the alarm about the men's disappearance on Monday. Dom Phillips visiting Aldeia Maloca PapiÃº, Roraima State, Brazil in 2019 In a statement,external[in Portuguese], they said that the two men had been travelling by boat in the Javari Valley to interview members of an indigenous guard. The area is located in the west of Amazonas state, near the border with Peru, and has seen incursions from illegal loggers and miners. On Sunday, the two stopped in SÃ£o Rafael, where Mr Pereira was scheduled to meet a local leader to discuss joint patrols between indigenous people and residents of riverside communities. According to the rights groups, Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira arrived at 06:00 local time and set off shortly afterwards towards Atalaia do Norte, a journey which takes around two hours. When they failed to arrive, Univaja sent out a search party at around 14:00 but found no trace of the two men along the stretch of river they had been expected to take. The last to see them were residents of SÃ£o Gabriel, a community downriver from SÃ£o Rafael, who spotted their boat going past, the statement adds. Police say they interviewed two people who are thought to be among the last to have seen the men. The witnesses were taken to Atalaia do Nore, where they were interviewed, but no arrests were made. The rights groups say Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira were traveling in a new boat and had enough fuel to cover their journey. They add that in the week leading up to the men's disappearance, the team had received threats. ""It wasn't the first time threats were made,"" the statement says, adding that previous instances had been reported to the police. The area is home to more than 20 indigenous groups, who have denounced activities by illegal miners, fishers and hunters. Amazon shootout: Illegal miners exploit lax enforcement A Funai base in the region has come under attack on a number of occasions in recent years. Mr Phillips' family has been appealing to the authorities to speed up the search. His Brazilian wife, Alessandra Sampaio, wrote ""our families are in despair, please answer the urgency of the moment with urgent actions"". ""In the forest every second counts, every second could be the difference between life and death,"" she added. Mr Phillips' sister, Sian Phillips, also appealed for help in a video statement. This video can not be played Watch: Sian Phillips makes a tearful plea for her brother's safety Mr Pereira's family has also released a statement describing the ""48 hours of anguish"" they have lived through since the disappearance. The statement says that the family is hopeful that their disappearance may be down to their boat breaking down and that the two ""are waiting for help"". ""We know that Bruno [Pereira] has extensive experience and knowledge of the region, however, time is a key factor in rescue operations, especially if they turn out to be injured."" The Brazilian government said that the federal police force was ""immediately mobilised"" and was ""taking all possible measures"" to find the two. But there has been criticism of the small number of police and navy personnel deployed in what is a vast expanse of rainforest crisscrossed by rivers. The navy only announced late on Monday that it would send a helicopter ""in addition to two vessels and a watercraft"". Mr Pereira's family has insisted that it is ""essential that specialized searches are carried out, by air, river and land, with all the human and material resources that the situation requires"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says the confidence vote result was ""convincing and decisive"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has won the backing of a majority of Tory MPs in a confidence vote despite a significant revolt against his leadership. The PM won 59% of the vote, meaning he is now immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year. In all, 211 Tory MPs voted they had confidence in the PM's leadership while 148 voted against him. Mr Johnson described his confidence vote win as ""decisive"". Striking an upbeat tone, he said it was a ""very good"", ""convincing"" result and ""an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about"". The result sees the prime minister remain in office, but critics said the scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened, with some calling on him to resign. The vote share in support of Mr Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former Prime Minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018, before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock. Partygate: What did Sue Gray's report reveal? What happens next after confidence vote? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""divided"" Conservative Party was ""propping up"" Mr Johnson after he survived the confidence vote. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said while Mr Johnson had clung on to power, ""his reputation is in tatters and his authority is now totally shot"". But Downing Street said the result ""renews the PM's mandate"" and allows the government to ""focus relentlessly on the issues that concern our voters"". Tory MP and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart told the BBC the prime minister ""has lots to prove"" but insisted the result ""was pretty decisive"". This video can not be played Watch: The moment Sir Graham Brady announces Boris Johnson won the confidence vote Mr Johnson, who became prime minister in 2019, was informed he would face a vote on his leadership on Sunday during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, after weeks of speculation over his future. The ballot was triggered by Conservative MPs after at least 15% of them wrote letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the party's backbench 1922 Committee. Discontent among Tory MPs has grown since a highly critical report into lockdown parties in and near Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic was published last month. The report laid bare the extent of Covid rule-breaking in Number 10, including at a birthday party Mr Johnson was fined by the police for attending in June 2020. The fine meant Mr Johnson became the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. Some Tory MPs have also expressed dissent over tax rises, the government's response to rising living costs and its policy direction. The first rule of politics: learn how to count. Mathematically, Boris Johnson was the winner in Monday's confidence vote. The second rule of politics: numbers often only tell so much of the story. You can claim victory and be robbed of authority in the same moment. Boris Johnson can point to his own thumping majority from the last election. But the simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem. Read morefrom Chris here. The last Conservative prime minister to face a party vote on their leadership was Mrs May, who won the vote but resigned six months later over her approach to Brexit. Mr Johnson succeeded her in July 2019 and then called a general election in which the Conservatives won their biggest majority since former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election victory. The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson uses his powers to call one. The next tests for Mr Johnson are by-elections held in Wakefield and in Tiverton & Honiton on the same day this month following the resignation of two Tory MPs. The Tory rebels who voted against Mr Johnson were insistent that the result had compromised the prime minister's ability to lead. One of them, Julian Sturdy, said the result was ""clear evidence that he no longer enjoys the full-hearted confidence of the parliamentary party and should consider his position"". Another one, Sir Roger Gale, said the result was very bad and he would be surprised if Mr Johnson was still in post by the autumn. But Mr Johnson's cabinet ministers rallied around him with messages of support. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the prime minister had secured ""a fresh mandate"" from the Conservative Party following his confidence vote win. Mr Javid tweeted: ""Tonight the PM has secured a fresh mandate from the parliamentary party. Now we need to unite and focus on the country's challenges."" Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi, who said he would back Mr Johnson before the vote, said the PM won ""handsomely"". ""I hope we can draw a line under this issue,"" he said. Highlighting Mr Johnson's general election victory in 2019, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said it was ""time to get back to the job of governing"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says British public is ""fed up"" with the PM The Labour leader said the public were ""fed up with a prime minister who promises big but never delivers"". The PM was ""utterly unfit for the great office that he holds"", Sir Keir said, and Tory MPs have ""ignored the British public"". Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the result left the prime minister ""fatally wounded"". ""We need someone in office that the British people can trust,"" he told the BBC. ""That's why this vote was so important."" The leader of the Liberal Democrats urged Tory MPs to ""do the right thing, resign the whip and sit as an independent. ""For the sake of our country, this failing prime minister cannot be propped up any longer,"" Sir Ed said. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford said he was ""stunned"" by the result, adding it was a ""big thing"" for that many Conservatives to vote against their own prime minister. He said the PM now has the support of less than a third of the House of Commons. ""For Boris, this should be over,"" he said.

"Cancelled flights and delays at airports are fuelling anxiety among UK holidaymakers ahead of the key summer season, travel agents have warned. Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of travel agents, said 30% of calls to its members were from people worried about future bookings. Thousands of travellers are thought to be stuck abroad after flight cancellations over the Jubilee weekend. The disruption is being driven by staff shortages across the aviation industry. The problems are taking time to resolve and Advantage's chief executive warned there were ""no guarantees"" the situation would have improved by the summer. ""Thirty per cent of everything my members are dealing with right now are calls from very anxious holidaymakers who have bookings, whose travel plans, as far as we know right now, will take place, but they are anxious because obviously they're hearing all [about] the disruption,"" said Julia Lo Bue-Said. Ms Bue-Said said airlines were already employing new staff, many of whom were already undergoing training, and that she hoped the industry would be ready by the busy summer period. However, Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, a union representing staff working in airports and across aviation engineering, said recent cancellations were having a ""really damaging impact"" on people's confidence. ""It would be difficult to give anybody the confidence at the present minute, that we are going to be okay by the school holidays in July,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. A sustainable long-term plan for the industry if the problems are to be resolved, he said, including better pay and conditions for workers in the sector. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Firms have oversold flights and holidays - Shapps Up to two million people were scheduled to fly to and from the UK over the bank holiday weekend, and the vast majority of flights have operated as expected. But several airlines have cancelled flights, with EasyJet scrapping a further 37 journeys on Monday. According to aviation data firm Cirium, 305 flights departing the UK were cancelled out of total of 10,662 scheduled flights over the Jubilee weekend. Most journeys - some 114 flights - were axed on Sunday and the airports worst affected were London Gatwick, London Luton and Bristol. EasyJet cancelled the most flights on Sunday, totalling 64, while Wizz Air cancelled 15 departing flights and BA axed eight. Families have been particularly affected by Sunday's disruption, with children stranded abroad as schools return and the exam season begins. Cirium said 189 international flights were cancelled to the UK over the long weekend, with the majority from the Netherlands (39 flights), Spain and the Canary Islands (24), France (24) and Germany (21). Airlines are being blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage following steep staff cuts during the height of Covid when travel ground to a halt. But industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the  pandemic. It has also called for immigration rules on hiring overseas workers to be relaxed to plug staff shortages, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ruled out such a move. Mr Shapps said the government had been clear that it was up to industry leaders to tackle the problems, which were also seen at Easter, and accused airlines ofhaving ""seriously oversold flights and holidays"". Before Covid, airports and airlines across Britain employed around 140,000 people, but since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone. Mr Clancy, of the Prospect union, said the government was ""culpable"" for withdrawing pandemic-related support from airlines too soon. But airlines had cut too many jobs, he said, and now needed to find ways to retain and recruit more workers. ""Ultimately this means fixing pay and conditions which have deteriorated significantly in recent years,"" Mr Clancy said. ""The problems we are seeing today are the result of a failed business model, unable to cope with any level of stress in the system. ""Unless the government and employers can come up with a sustainable long term plan for the aviation industry, that supports jobs and skills, then it is hard to see the situation improving."" The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said despite the recent disruption the ""vast majority of people"" have been able to fly and it expected that to be the case for the summer. ABTA urged passengers to follow advice from airlines and airports for when to arrive for flights, as ""many are arriving well before check-in begins which puts additional pressure on airport services"". Jen Kassel is currently stranded in Spain with her partner and three young children after her EasyJet flight was cancelled on Sunday. She said the family had been given no explanation, but had been offered accommodation at a hotel in Benalmadena. ""The kids were really stressed,"" she said. Nikolai Brooks and his wife Vicky, who live near Brighton, have been stuck at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam since Saturday after their EasyJet flight was cancelled. Their new flight for Monday evening has already been delayed by three hours. They have had to pay for two extra nights in a hotel near the airport, which has cost them about Â£600, not including food, Mr Brooks told the BBC. ""We didn't even get an email through that it had been cancelled,"" he said. ""It's more frustrating for my wife, she's a teacher and she was due back for today."" In a statement, EasyJet said it was ""very sorry"" for flights being cancelled and said the disruption was caused by ""the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""Customers are being provided with options to rebook or receive a refund, as well as hotel accommodation and meals where required, along with information on how to arrange this quickly online or via the app,"" a spokeswoman said.

"The US envoy on climate change John Kerry has warned that the war in Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to prolong global reliance on coal. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kerry criticised a number of large countries for not living up to the promises they made at the COP26 climate summit. Climate diplomats meet again today in Bonn amid new, energy security worries. If countries extend their reliance on coal in response to the war, then ""we are cooked,"" Mr Kerry said. After COP26: Are nations on track? English 'rainforests' illegally burned - campaigners Reduce demolitions to limit climate change - MPs The fragile unity shown in Glasgow last November is likely to be tested in Bonn as countries deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. Mr Kerry told the BBC that despite these drawbacks, ""as a world we are still not moving fast enough,"" to rein in the emissions of warming gases that are driving up temperatures. ""We can still win this battle,""  the former senator said, but it will require a ""wholesale elevation of effort by countries all around the world"". Mr Kerry's call was echoed by a leading Ukrainian scientist who urged delegates to speed up their transition away from fossil fuels. Dr Svitana Krakovska said oil and gas were the ""enablers of war"". Today'smeeting in Bonn,external, which will last until the end of next week, is much smaller than COP26 and is mainly a technical negotiation. It occurs halfway between the big conferences in Glasgow andCOP27,external, to be held in Egypt. The talks will be carried out by civil servants with limited political input and will review progress on a host of issues agreed in theGlasgow Climate Pact, Bluntly, not a lot. ABBC analysis showsthat across a range of issues, very little has been achieved. The world emerged from Glasgow into an energy crisis sparked by a rapid rise in the price of gas. This has been massively compounded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing problems in global supply lines. Prices for fossil energy have shot up dramatically as governments worry about security of supply. COP26 President Alok Sharma at the conclusion of talks in Glasgow - He recently told MPs that political leaders were distracted from climate issues by war and cost of living crises Governments have also been slow in submitting new carbon cutting plans as they have promised to do by September.  The list of laggards includes some very significant countries such as India, and the hosts of COP27, Egypt. Despite this, there is a belief that political leaders still see climate as a major issue, especially in the light ofdramatic heatwaves in India and Pakistan, which were linked to human use of fossil fuels. The discussions in the former West German capital will tell us if that's true. ""I think we'll see the Bonn talks as a real test for whether political will is just words,"" said Alex Scott from environmental think tank, E3G. ""Or whether there are real genuine commitments to make the changes in policy and in spending plans that are needed to address these issues."" Ukraine and Russia normally send delegates to this event, but it remains to be seen if both countries will participate. This video can not be played ""Think about us,"" says Ukrainian climate scientist Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who led the Ukrainian delegation at the approval sessions of the recent IPCC reports, says climate isn't a critical issue right now. But she hopes negotiators will recognise the role fossil fuels are playing in the war, and act with greater haste to transition away from them. ""The cause of this war, the enabler of this war is from oil and gas,"" she told BBC News. ""So this is the point for everybody to just think about this and use this opportunity to stop using so much energy and think about our way of life."" ""The global thing that has happened are these unprecedentedly high fossil fuel prices,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. ""That just means that clean energy is extremely competitive economically at the moment."" Some countries have indeed been increasing their coal production, such as India, where the government has decided to re-open more than 100 coal mines previously considered uneconomical. But in the first quarter of 2022,India also added 3 gigawatts of solar power capacity,external. That's roughly a fifth of the UK's entire solar installation, in just three months. In Europe, which hastabled plansfor a swift move away from Russian energy, many countries are seeking alternative sources of fossil fuels ahead of an anticipated energy crunch this coming winter. The worry for environmentalists is that some like Germany, are now spending money on long-term fossil infrastructure, such as therecently announced plans,externalfor new LNG terminals. This could prolong the use of natural gas and keep emissions high. The most recent assessment indicates that China, the world's largest emitter, has seen the longest decline in carbon output in at least a decade. Workers in China install solar panels at a tidal power station - green energy sources are rising rapidly even as coal production increases as well Areview of data,externalcarried out for Carbon Brief found emissions had fallen since last summer and were down 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This has happened because of last year's slowdown in the real estate market. It's continued because of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the re-introduction of lockdowns which have stemmed economic activity. There are other changes taking effect in China - production of electric cars and trucks has doubled in a year to 20% of all new vehicles. The number of wind turbines and solar farms coming on stream in the first four months of 2022 was up 100% on the record levels installed in 2021. Whilecoal production has ramped up,external, on balance, observers believe that China's emissions will fall this year, with implications for the rest of the world. Oil drilling in the Permian basis in Texas has ramped up as a result of US restrictions on Russian energy imports ""We could actually see less emissions this year because of increased prices for fossil fuels and because China's economy is in a tailspin,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, who carried out the research. By contrast the US, where President Biden has struggled to get climate legislation on the statute books, has seen another oil boom. According toanalysis,externalfrom Rystad Energy, flows of crude from the Permian basin are expected to grow by around 1 million barrels per day this year. The region in West Texas now has higher production than any country apart from Russia and Saudi Arabia. To keep this key goal of the Paris climate agreement alive, carbon emissions need to be slashed essentially in half by 2030. But recent evidence from the UK Met Office indicates that there's now afifty-fifty chanceof temporarily going past the temperature threshold in the next five years. A woman seeks some relief from scorching temperatures in India For many developing countries and small island states, an increase of 1.5C with knock on effects on sea levels poses existential questions. And they fear that the lack of political focus by richer nations on this core issue is increasing the threat. ""Fundamentally, the war and cost of living must not be used as an excuse to let the 1.5C goal slip out of reach,"" said Ambassador Conrod Hunte, from Antigua and Barbuda, who's the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States in the Bonn talks. ""And adequate, fair climate finance is intrinsic to keeping us on this pathway."" Despite the many problems, participants believe there are some grounds for cautious optimism. This energy crisis has made discussions about heat pumps and electric vehicles part of the mainstream in a way the COPs have failed to do. Thesuccess of climate-focussed candidatesin Australia's recent election indicates that voters may be more attuned to voices who are connecting the global crises to rising temperatures. The Bonn talks could also be a moment when addressing climate become key to dealing with these other challenges as well. ""There are a number of interlinking crises right now, and it is possible for governments to seize this opening to tackle these crises, and take advantage of the opportunities, and build the kind of co-operation globally that's needed,"" said David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute.

"This video can not be played Fans erupt with joy as Wales finally qualify for the World Cup Wales' manager has spoken of his pride at the ""monumental"" achievement for the nation after qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in 64 years. Theybeat Ukraine 1-0in Cardiff in a tense and dramatic game after Gareth Bale's deflected free-kick. Rob Page told his players that he ""loves them to bits"". As the reality of Sunday's achievement sank in, many jubilant fans on Monday said they thought they would never see this moment. Wales will shareGroup B with USA, Iran and Englandat the tournament in Qatar, starting in November. Q&A: Wales at the World Cup in Qatar Chris Coleman: 'We're still benefiting from Gary Speed's work' The joy and guilt for Wales fans over Ukraine win Rob Page says he has barely had any sleep after celebrating Wales' historic win ""Even at the final whistle last night I was thinking... is this a cruel dream that I'm having?"" Pagetold BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""But then you realise that it's reality. ""It's one of those surreal moments when you wake up and then realise that we are off to the World Cup. It is unbelievable."" Wales have reached the World Cup only once before - in 1958 under Jimmy Murphy's management. Remarkably, both Murphy and Page are from Rhondda in the south Wales valleys, and grew up only a few miles apart. A ""heroic"" saving from Hennessey to keep Wales at the forefront ""How spooky is that?"" said Page. ""Two people from the Rhondda: it was written in the stars, wasn't it? It's a special moment for me and my family."" He called the win ""massive"" for the country, adding: ""We've seen the tide has turned slightly with regards to football and rugby. In pictures: Wales' emotional World Cup return Walesâ painful World Cup history ""I think football has become our number one sport. We'll always be known for rugby, of course we will, but this is massive - it's monumental what we've done."" This video can not be played World Cup 2022: Fans' joy as Wales qualify for Qatar finals Page also paid tribute to Gary Speed, who died in 2011 while Wales manager. Speed is often credited with having laid the foundations for the nation's current success, and Page said Sunday's match was for him and his family. That sentiment wasechoed by former Wales manager Chris Coleman, who led Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016. ""He [Speed] put a lot of things in place. I know I benefited from that, I'm sure Ryan Giggs and Pagey did too,"" he said. Ffion Owen, who watched the game in Cardiff, said: ""I don't think I had any more to cry, it was euphoria, it was a dream that you can't imagine happening until it happens."" Celebrations all round and a once in a lifetime opportunity for some Rhodri Ogwen Williams, who lives in Qatar, said it was an emotional moment for him after he lost his father last year. ""I believe my dad's spirit was in (goalkeeper) Wayne Hennessey's hands last night. It was a beautiful, beautiful moment."" Rhodri, a sports broadcaster, said many Welsh fans were watching the game from his restaurant and ""everybody is so welcome"" to Qatar. ""The Wales fans are going to have the time of their life,"" he added. Chelsea Wadeson and her son Bleu, who is wearing a Wales shirt ""It was amazing... it was fab,"" said Chelsea Wadeson, of Wrexham. ""I don't think we'll be going to Qatar but we'll definitely be watching them. We were so chuffed."" Phil Higgins says the supportive crowd was a factor in Wales getting the win Phil Higgins, from Wrexham, said watching the game was ""fabulous"". ""It's great isn't it, but a bit unexpected as well. They hung in there and obviously the crowd was a big factor."" Wales deserved the win, says Gaynor Williams For Gaynor Williams, travelling to Qatar is out of the question, but her sons who are avid Wales supporters may take the trip. ""It's fantastic, 64 years since they've done it. Brilliant. Well done to them, they deserve it."" The victory was also marked with sympathy for Ukraine and their fans. Ukraine had hoped to make the final step to the World Cup after reaching the play-off via a3-1 win over Scotland last Wednesdayin their first competitive clash since Russia's invasion.

Svitlana Phillips and her husband Paul were supporting different teams but watching in the same household There were divided loyalties in one Welsh household on Sunday night. Svitlana Phillips, who is from Ukraine, said she felt ""a little bit disappointed"" but Wales were ""very generous, supportive and know how to share their win"". Her husband Paul, from Swansea, said there was ""quite a bit of rivalry"" and it was his wife who ""walked out on a few occasions"" during the nerve-wracking match.

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Firefighters suffered heavy loss of life in the blaze, and some are still missing Bangladeshi officials have accused the operator of a container depot of exacerbating a deadly blaze by not storing chemicals safely. Nine firefighters were among more than 40 people killed after fire broke out near the port city of Chittagong. Officials said containers of hydrogen peroxide were labelled incorrectly - and firefighters doused flames with water instead of foam. The depot's owner has yet to comment on the allegations. On Monday, officials revised down the initial death toll from 49 to 41, saying some bodies had been counted twice. Hundreds of people were injured or are still missing in the disaster at BM Container Depot in Sitakunda, 40km (25 miles) from Chittagong, and the number of dead is expected to rise. This video can not be played Watch: Fire crews try to bring the fire under control at the container depot in Chittagong, Bangladesh Purnachandra Mutsuddi, an assistant director with the local firefighting service, told the AFP news agency that as soon as the firefighters entered the depot on Saturday they unwittingly doused the hydrogen peroxide with water, setting off an explosive reaction that sent ""a container flying more than 500 feet"". ""There are some rules to keep hydrogen peroxide. Had we known this, we would never throw water. We would never take our vehicle inside the depot,"" he said. The fire, which has now been blazing for three days, is under control but has not been extinguished completely. Local police chief Abul Kalam Azad said that an investigation into the causes of the blaze had begun. The chemical stockpile exploded with devastating consequences It remains unclear what sparked the blaze, which injured about 300 people, more than 12 of whom are in a critical condition. Two firefighters are among the missing. People seeking news of those unaccounted for have converged on the local hospital in Chittagong, some holding photos of their loved ones. Jahanara Begum was waiting to give a sample for DNA testing to identify the remains of her son, Shahadat Hossain, who was a lorry driver. ""His father just died last year, now I have lost my son,"" she told BBC Bengali. ""He parked his truck and went to the canteen for dinner. The canteen caught fire and my son got trapped."" Shahadat Hossain had been in the canteen when fire broke out The family of Imran Hossain Mazumdar identified his body on Monday afternoon. He had been one of the first firefighters on the scene. Mr Mazumdar leaves behind a wife who is six months pregnant, a son and a disabled daughter, his niece said. Police spokesperson Shanewaz Khaled said it could take weeks to identify the deceased. ""If someone is missing from the fire, the families can give their samples to us,"" he told BBC Bengali. Officials had collected 23 samples for DNA testing so far, he said. The fire broke out at around 21:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Saturday and hundreds of firefighters, police and volunteers quickly arrived on the scene. As they tried to extinguish the blaze a huge explosion rocked the site, engulfing many of the rescuers in flames and throwing debris and people into the air. ""The explosion just threw me some 10 metres from where I was standing. My hands and legs are burnt,"" lorry driver Tofael Ahmed told AFP news agency. The blast was so large it was heard several kilometres away and shattered the windows of nearby buildings. One local shopkeeper told reporters that a piece of debris had flown half a kilometre and landed in his pond. He described seeing ""fireballs falling like rain"" after the explosion.

The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ.

Ms Brignell said: ""I booked the help three months in advance, it wasn't as if I just turned up, they knew I was coming, and I reminded them two weeks ago, and still I didn't get the service that I should expect to have."" Her friend Sonia Sodha tweeted a picture of Ms Brignell on the plane. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Brignell said: ""I can't use my arms or legs. To get off a plane I need two people to lift me from the airplane seat into an aisle chair, which is a specially-designed narrow wheelchair to push me along the aisle off the plane, and lift me into my wheelchair waiting outside. ""My wheelchair arrived promptly, but the people who were supposed to help me get off the plane didn't turn up - they were busy elsewhere."" She said British Airways staff were ""fantastic"", very apologetic and brought drinks while she waited for Gatwick Airport staff to arrive. But she said she was left unable to use the toilet and her carers could not go off duty, because of the delay. Other passengers hoping to board the plane for a different flight were also delayed. Ms Brignell said: ""I have been very nervous about travelling by plane because I had heard so many horror stories about people's chairs going missing."" She said this was her second time flying abroad and the fourth flight she had taken. Ms Brignell said British Airways staff got her off the plane and she received an apology form Gatwick via Twitter, but she plans to submit an official complaint. She said: ""I just feel in 2022 people shouldn't be stuck on a plane for that long. ""UK airports need to get their act together and plan their staffing appropriately."" Baroness Grey-Thompson said she took direct action when she suffered a recent similar experience. She said: ""I was flying to Berlin, the plane was two and a half hours late, but after waiting just over half an hour on board they couldn't give me any clear indication of when the assistance was going to come. ""My chair was at the gate, so I decided to get on the floor and pull myself off the plane."" Frank Gardner said situations such as this were becoming ""depressingly familiar"" at airports BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who uses a wheelchair, said such situations were becoming ""depressingly familiar"". ""The airports seem to be slipping back. The level of investment and effort that goes into making money at these airports isn't matched by the effort and money that needs to go into getting disabled passengers off the plane at the same time as everybody else."" Gatwick said it would launch an investigation into why Ms Brignell was left on the plane for so long. A spokesman for the airport said: ""The treatment received at Gatwick Airport was unacceptable and I would like to offer our sincere apologies to Victoria. ""This incident has been escalated and Gatwick and Wilson James, our assistance provider, are investigating how this happened as a matter of urgency."" A spokesman for Wilson James said: ""We are deeply disappointed to have delivered a poor service on this occasion. ""While the aviation sector in particular is struggling with well-documented pressures, Ms Brignell's experience is unacceptable and falls far below our values and aims.""

"Elon Musk has threatened to walk away from his $44bn takeover of Twitter, accusing the social media company of ""thwarting"" his requests to learn more about its user base. In a letter filed with regulators, Mr Musk said he was entitled to do his own measurement of spam accounts. The letter formalises a dispute that has simmered for weeks after Mr Musk declared the deal ""on hold"" pending further information. Twitter has defended its estimates. But Mr Musk has said he believes spam and fake accounts represent a far greater share than the less than 5% of daily users that Twitter reports publicly. ""As Twitter's prospective owner, Mr Musk is clearly entitled to the requested data to enable him to prepare for transitioning Twitter's business to his ownership and to facilitate his transaction financing. To do both, he must have a complete and accurate understanding of the very core of Twitter's business model - its active user base,"" lawyer Mike Ringler wrote in the letter. ""Based on Twitter's behaviour to date, and the company's latest correspondence in particular, Mr Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights,"" the letter said. ""This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement."" The dispute has raised more doubts about the future of the takeover, which Twitter's board approved in April. ""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" the company said in a statement. Twitter, which has said Mr Musk waived typical rights to due diligence in his eagerness to clinch the deal, added that it intended to complete the takeover at the agreed price and terms. Mr Musk, who faces a $1bn break-up fee and possible lawsuit if he opts out, first raised the issue of the spam accounts on social media last month, saying the deal was on hold but he remained committed to the acquisition. Twitter hits back on Musk doubts over fake accounts Elon Musk puts $44bn Twitter deal on hold Twitter investor sues Elon Musk over takeover bid Analysts have said the Tesla boss might be using the issue to try to renegotiate the price or even walk away. They said Mr Musk's decision to raise the issue on social media was unconventional, making it difficult to establish how serious he was. When Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal defended the company's process in a series of tweets, Mr Musk responded with a poo emoji. Mr Musk has said he believes that bots could account for 20% or more of Twitter users. The letter, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, confirms that the two sides have gone back and forth on the issue since early May. It says Mr Musk merits ""reasonable cooperation"" as he tries to line up financing for the deal. ""Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr Musk's data requests,"" the letter says. ""Twitter's effort to characterise it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue."" Texas attorney general Ken Paxton entered the debate on Monday, saying he had launched an investigation into Twitter for ""potentially false reporting over its fake bot accounts"". Twitter has until 27 June to respond to his request for information. Mr Musk's plans for the company have drawn intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, while raising some alarm among investors of electric car company Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, which Mr Musk also leads. He has lined up outside investors to help pay for the takeover and is also using equity and loans backed by his Tesla shares, which have been hit in recent weeks as market turmoil wipes billions from the values of companies including Tesla. The decline has also made Mr Musk's offer of $54.20 per share for Twitter look even more generous. On Monday, Twitter shares were trading below $39, down 3%, though they later regained some ground. They have yet to return to the highs they hit last month shortly after Mr Musk revealed he had purchased about 9% of the firm's shares. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the letter marked the ""strongest signal yet that the Tesla founder is prepared to walk away"". ""This is a move Twitter investors have for weeks been steeling themselves for: the moment when Elon Musk's haphazard ruminations in tweets have been distilled into an official letter to regulators,"" she said. ""However, given the added volatility which has hit the tech sector since Mr Musk made his offer, it's highly likely he's after a cheaper price even if Twitter does provide the data requested in support of its initial analysis.""

"Kyiv didn't feel like a city bracing itself for 150,000 Russian soldiers to cross the border into Ukraine. Arriving in Kyiv in January I decided to brave the supermarket near my flat. You could get your hands on just about any kind of meat or vegetable it seemed, even a pint of beer on aisle six. ""It's all a bluff"", ""we're at war already"", were the most common responses when I asked people whether they were worried about what seemed to be the unthinkable at the time. Of course, within five weeks that all changed. Some in the West predicted Kyiv would fall within 72 hours. Over a period of 100 days the city has gone from stubborn normality, through complete darkness, and is now emerging into some sort of calm. It's still far from what it was before the war, but it's nevertheless a picture of defiance. ""You'd better get your stuff together,"" was the short phone call I received at 04:50 on 24 February. I headed to the roof of our building. The night Kyiv and Ukraine changed forever There were regular thuds from air strikes. Low-flying jets occasionally flew overhead, and black plumes of smoke appeared on the horizon. Then, not for the last time, the howl of the siren. The shadow of war had descended on this ancient city, and it felt almost immediate. Many of those who chose to stay in Kyiv headed underground Highways out of Kyiv were blocked by thousands of cars trying to get away from the Russian advance. People queued at ATMs, as well as recruitment offices for Ukraine's territorial defence. They would show ID and be issued with the now familiar yellow armband and an automatic weapon. Just before midday, President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that anyone prepared to defend Ukraine would be armed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

These extraordinary words from a world leader matched the immediate threat his country faced. From our bomb shelter, people watched on the social media platform, Telegram, as Russian paratroopers tried to take the Hostomel air base to the north-west of Kyiv. There was fierce fighting, and it was in this area where the new frontline formed. The following weeks would see the Russians resort to longer-range missile strikes on central locations in the city. Kyiv's air defence systems often worked, but residential buildings were regularly hit. More than half the city's four million population would leave. Across the country almost 15 million Ukrainians would be displaced, according to the United Nations. A direct hit on the Retroville shopping mall caused a square mile of damage The common theme with each impact was the scale of the devastation. In March a deadly strike left parts of the Retroville shopping mall in the north-east of the city flattened. Cladding was blown off neighbouring blocks. Here a kindergarten was damaged from shrapnel from an intercepted missile Thousands of people were trapped in the fighting in surrounding towns like Irpin and Bucha. Temporary ceasefires allowed some to escape to Kyiv train station, where the majority would travel west towards cities like Lviv. Many took their chances under heavy shelling. Residents fled in terror Russia's occupation of towns just outside Kyiv In April, the tide turned. The Russian retreat allowed Kyiv to claw back some of the reality it had lost. There were no more military checkpoints in central parts of the city. Expressions of anger and fear were replaced with occasional smiles. Menus in cafes and restaurants were offering a greater choice. As the sun beamed overhead, it was like looking at Kyiv through a different filter. Despite fears at the time, the city didn't find itself under siege like Mariupol and Severodonetsk. Clear roads to the south kept blood pumping into it, keeping Kyiv alive. Reprieve for the capital, however, exposed overwhelming evidence of war crimes. In residential towns like Borodyanka not one building had been left undamaged. Police found hundreds of soldiers and civilians in shallow graves and continue to do so. The Kremlin has always denied committing war crimes and described this evidence as ""fake"".  However, there is nothing artificial about the devastation that surrounds Kyiv. The past few weeks has seen the city feel as normal as it has ever been. The nights are still silent with a 23:00 curfew, but the day brings more life. Recently, Vyshyvanka Day saw Kyvites don traditional embroidered Ukrainian shirts Museums are open once more. Angry traffic jams are a thing again. Officials believe the city is back to two-thirds of its original population. It certainly feels like it with busier parks, fuller theatres and subways being used to get the train once again. Despite the uncertainty remaining over whether the Russians will make another attempt on Ukraine's capital, the city seems determined to heal. What the next 100 days will bring is far from clear, and Ukrainians know it. Restoring normality is just as much a coping mechanism for people, as it is essential.

"Ben (right) has been at Disneyland Paris with his brother and their extended family Ben, 17, was due home on Saturday in plenty of time to take his maths GCSE on Tuesday, but after a cancelled flight and a frantic scrabble for train tickets, he will only just make it. He is one of thousands of British holiday-makers thought to be stranded abroad, after the cancellation of more than 100 flights over the weekend. Among them are hundreds of school pupils and some teachers set to miss school on Monday after half-term. And they face an anxious journey home. ""Ben was going to have a couple of days at home to get his revision in, prepare mentally for it,"" said his mother Emma, who did not want their surnames used. After their EasyJet flight home from Paris was cancelled, the earliest flight back that the airline could provide was on Tuesday - too late. So after spending hundreds of pounds on Eurostar tickets, they are now due to arrive back at home in Stockport by 11:30 BST on Monday evening, in time for the exam on Tuesday morning. ""Hopefully he'll get there. But there's no guarantee,"" she said. And EasyJet had been ""impossible to contact and completely unhelpful"", she added. There are reports that others are even less lucky and are missing GCSE or A-level exams altogether. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Why are so many flights being cancelled? Travel industry plea for overseas workers rejected Airlines are being blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage with lower post-Covid staffing levels. But the airlines themselves say the government could also have done more to support the industry during the pandemic and to speed up the process of security checks for new staff now. Andrew Crawley, chief commercial officer at American Express Global Business Travel, told the BBC's Today programme said it would be ""sensible"" for the government to temporarily change immigration rules to allow airlines to recruit overseas workers to plug staff shortages. ""Some airlines relied on EU citizens for up to 30% of their workforce, pre-Brexit, so that labour pool no longer being available adds to the challenge that we have here,"" he said. However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has rejected such a request from the aviation industry. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled over the past week. While some families never reached their destination or arrived late, others are now finding their return flights are not operating. It is not just exam students - younger children are missing the start of the new half-term too. ""The curriculum is packed and losing three days from school post-Covid isn't good,"" said father-of-four Joe Murray from Milton Keynes. ""There isn't time to really catch up."" The family had booked return flights from Tenerife to be back in time for the Jubilee celebrations but missed the whole four-day weekend after Wizz Air cancelled their return twice. Joe Murray's daughters will miss three days of school ""Wizz Air have had since last Wednesday to get us home, have cancelled once whilst we had checked in and were waiting at the gate, and the other four hours before the flight,"" Mr Murray said. ""It's not good enough,"" he added. Holiday-makers who spoke to the BBC said they were shocked at the lack of communication from the airlines. EasyJet apologised for the disruption, saying it was doing everything it could to support passengers. It has extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and said it was helping those affected find hotel accommodation. Wizz Air also apologised and said passengers would be offered alternative flights, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week. But the ongoing upheaval will affect children who have not even left home, with some school staff also stranded and unable to get back in time. Kelly and her husband are making their way as fast as they can from Montenegro back to Lincolnshire. After their flight home was cancelled on Sunday, EasyJet offered them an alternative flight on Thursday. ""We are both teachers so have to get back,"" says Kelly. So instead they took a bus to Dubrovnik, Croatia, where they waited for more than four hours in the bus station for EasyJet to confirm their accommodation. They will take a four-hour bus trip to Split on Monday so they can fly from there to Bristol on Tuesday. They will then get a train from Bristol to Gatwick to pick up their car and with a bit of luck be back in the classroom by Wednesday. Kelly and her husband are taking buses to Dubrovnik then Split to get home two days earlier ""We do feel really let down by EasyJet,"" said Kelly. ""We wanted to get back to work as soon as we possibly could and they didn't help with that at all."" Pol, who teaches in a special educational needs school in west London has had a similar experience trying to get home from Bodrum, Turkey. The students at his school find changes to their teaching schedule particularly upsetting, he said. So he does not want want to be away longer than he can avoid. ""People from home think a couple more days in the sun, it can't be that bad being in the Mediterranean by the sea, but the point is we're all uptight and upset and to a certain degree disgusted that in the 21st century we're dealing with a company that prides itself on being digital but there's no information."" EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations.

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ben (right) has been at Disneyland Paris with his brother and their extended family Ben, 17, was due home on Saturday in plenty of time to take his maths GCSE on Tuesday, but after a cancelled flight and a frantic scrabble for train tickets, he will only just make it. He is one of thousands of British holiday-makers thought to be stranded abroad, after the cancellation of more than 100 flights over the weekend. Among them are hundreds of school pupils and some teachers set to miss school on Monday after half-term. And they face an anxious journey home. ""Ben was going to have a couple of days at home to get his revision in, prepare mentally for it,"" said his mother Emma, who did not want their surnames used. After their EasyJet flight home from Paris was cancelled, the earliest flight back that the airline could provide was on Tuesday - too late. So after spending hundreds of pounds on Eurostar tickets, they are now due to arrive back at home in Stockport by 11:30 BST on Monday evening, in time for the exam on Tuesday morning. ""Hopefully he'll get there. But there's no guarantee,"" she said. And EasyJet had been ""impossible to contact and completely unhelpful"", she added. There are reports that others are even less lucky and are missing GCSE or A-level exams altogether. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Why are so many flights being cancelled? Travel industry plea for overseas workers rejected Airlines are being blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage with lower post-Covid staffing levels. But the airlines themselves say the government could also have done more to support the industry during the pandemic and to speed up the process of security checks for new staff now. Andrew Crawley, chief commercial officer at American Express Global Business Travel, told the BBC's Today programme said it would be ""sensible"" for the government to temporarily change immigration rules to allow airlines to recruit overseas workers to plug staff shortages. ""Some airlines relied on EU citizens for up to 30% of their workforce, pre-Brexit, so that labour pool no longer being available adds to the challenge that we have here,"" he said. However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has rejected such a request from the aviation industry. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled over the past week. While some families never reached their destination or arrived late, others are now finding their return flights are not operating. It is not just exam students - younger children are missing the start of the new half-term too. ""The curriculum is packed and losing three days from school post-Covid isn't good,"" said father-of-four Joe Murray from Milton Keynes. ""There isn't time to really catch up."" The family had booked return flights from Tenerife to be back in time for the Jubilee celebrations but missed the whole four-day weekend after Wizz Air cancelled their return twice. Joe Murray's daughters will miss three days of school ""Wizz Air have had since last Wednesday to get us home, have cancelled once whilst we had checked in and were waiting at the gate, and the other four hours before the flight,"" Mr Murray said. ""It's not good enough,"" he added. Holiday-makers who spoke to the BBC said they were shocked at the lack of communication from the airlines. EasyJet apologised for the disruption, saying it was doing everything it could to support passengers. It has extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and said it was helping those affected find hotel accommodation. Wizz Air also apologised and said passengers would be offered alternative flights, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week. But the ongoing upheaval will affect children who have not even left home, with some school staff also stranded and unable to get back in time. Kelly and her husband are making their way as fast as they can from Montenegro back to Lincolnshire. After their flight home was cancelled on Sunday, EasyJet offered them an alternative flight on Thursday. ""We are both teachers so have to get back,"" says Kelly. So instead they took a bus to Dubrovnik, Croatia, where they waited for more than four hours in the bus station for EasyJet to confirm their accommodation. They will take a four-hour bus trip to Split on Monday so they can fly from there to Bristol on Tuesday. They will then get a train from Bristol to Gatwick to pick up their car and with a bit of luck be back in the classroom by Wednesday. Kelly and her husband are taking buses to Dubrovnik then Split to get home two days earlier ""We do feel really let down by EasyJet,"" said Kelly. ""We wanted to get back to work as soon as we possibly could and they didn't help with that at all."" Pol, who teaches in a special educational needs school in west London has had a similar experience trying to get home from Bodrum, Turkey. The students at his school find changes to their teaching schedule particularly upsetting, he said. So he does not want want to be away longer than he can avoid. ""People from home think a couple more days in the sun, it can't be that bad being in the Mediterranean by the sea, but the point is we're all uptight and upset and to a certain degree disgusted that in the 21st century we're dealing with a company that prides itself on being digital but there's no information."" EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations.

"Victoria Brignell was left on a plane for more than 90 minutes Gatwick Airport has apologised to a disabled passenger who was left on a plane for more than an hour and a half after it had landed. Victoria Brignell, who is quadriplegic, said she was initially told it would take 50 minutes to help her from the aircraft. Her treatment has drawn criticism from former Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. Gatwick Airport described Ms Brignell's treatment as ""unacceptable"". Ms Brignell said: ""I booked the help three months in advance, it wasn't as if I just turned up, they knew I was coming, and I reminded them two weeks ago, and still I didn't get the service that I should expect to have."" Her friend Sonia Sodha tweeted a picture of Ms Brignell on the plane. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Brignell said: ""I can't use my arms or legs. To get off a plane I need two people to lift me from the airplane seat into an aisle chair, which is a specially-designed narrow wheelchair to push me along the aisle off the plane, and lift me into my wheelchair waiting outside. ""My wheelchair arrived promptly, but the people who were supposed to help me get off the plane didn't turn up - they were busy elsewhere."" She said British Airways staff were ""fantastic"", very apologetic and brought drinks while she waited for Gatwick Airport staff to arrive. But she said she was left unable to use the toilet and her carers could not go off duty, because of the delay. Other passengers hoping to board the plane for a different flight were also delayed. Ms Brignell said: ""I have been very nervous about travelling by plane because I had heard so many horror stories about people's chairs going missing."" She said this was her second time flying abroad and the fourth flight she had taken. Ms Brignell said British Airways staff got her off the plane and she received an apology form Gatwick via Twitter, but she plans to submit an official complaint. She said: ""I just feel in 2022 people shouldn't be stuck on a plane for that long. ""UK airports need to get their act together and plan their staffing appropriately."" Baroness Grey-Thompson said she took direct action when she suffered a recent similar experience. She said: ""I was flying to Berlin, the plane was two and a half hours late, but after waiting just over half an hour on board they couldn't give me any clear indication of when the assistance was going to come. ""My chair was at the gate, so I decided to get on the floor and pull myself off the plane."" Frank Gardner said situations such as this were becoming ""depressingly familiar"" at airports BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who uses a wheelchair, said such situations were becoming ""depressingly familiar"". ""The airports seem to be slipping back. The level of investment and effort that goes into making money at these airports isn't matched by the effort and money that needs to go into getting disabled passengers off the plane at the same time as everybody else."" Gatwick said it would launch an investigation into why Ms Brignell was left on the plane for so long. A spokesman for the airport said: ""The treatment received at Gatwick Airport was unacceptable and I would like to offer our sincere apologies to Victoria. ""This incident has been escalated and Gatwick and Wilson James, our assistance provider, are investigating how this happened as a matter of urgency."" A spokesman for Wilson James said: ""We are deeply disappointed to have delivered a poor service on this occasion.

"Heavy fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying for weeks to capture It comes as the battle for Donbas grinds on with neither side making major gains A military analyst says the fighting in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One Justin Crump says Russia appears to have slight momentum but are âlucky to capture a field in 24 hoursâ ""Stalemate is not an option"" for Ukraine, the country's president has said, as he again floated the idea of Nato membership Volodymyr Zelensky said the country had lost too many people to ""simply cede our territory"" Meanwhile, the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks have been handed over to Kyiv, families of Ukraine's Azov unit say Edited by Chris Giles Todayâs live page was edited by Jeremy Gahagan, Alex Therrien, Marie Jackson and Chris Giles. The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk.""

She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported.

in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV.

"Boris Johnson remains as Conservative leader after winning a vote of his own MPs The MPs voted by 211 to 148 to keep him as party leader and prime minister At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he says he wants to ""draw a line"" under his problems Supporters - and some opponents - of the PM also say it's time to move on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss emphatically backs the PM and dismisses suggestions of a leadership bid ""I think [the PM] won the vote comprehensively,"" says Johnson critic Andrea Leadsom But former leader Lord Hague says the damage done to Johnson is severe Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" that Johnson remains PM Edited by Marie Jackson That's it for now but if you still want more, follow our latest news storyhere. Our live coverage today was written by Joseph Lee, Sam Hancock, Alex Kleiderman and Craig Hutchison. It was edited by Owen Amos and Marie Jackson. The bunting came down at No 10 as Boris Johnson promised a renewed focus on the government's agenda We're bringing our live coverage of the fall-out from last night's confidence vote to a close shortly. But here's a round-up of what we learned today: Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent There was a sense of resignation in the centre of Brecon after Conservative MPs voted to back Boris Johnson. âItâs almost a case of better the devil you know really,â one man told me. We heard the sentiment more than once from people who didnât see an obvious alternative leader in a seat the Tories reclaimed from the Liberal Democrats in 2019. Dawn McIntosh says she is ""on the fence"" about Boris Johnson but is sticking with his party At her carpet and flooring business, Youngs, in the town
centre, Dawn McIntosh said she would stick with the Conservatives. She was âon the fenceâ about Johnson, but thought ânow
would definitely be the wrong timeâ to change the leader. Malcolm MacDonald, whose family have a fish stall in the
town market, said the prime minister had been the subject of a âwitch huntâ. âJohnson has got a lot of faults, but so has everybody,â he
said. âHe looks like a clown, but heâs not as big a clown as
everyone thinks he is.â Malcolm MacDonald: ""Heâs not as big a clown as everyone thinks he is"" Giles Watling is pictured here in 2014 with former prime minister David Cameron Giles Watling, one of the Tory MPs who sided against Boris Johnson on Monday, says the prime minister made some ""slightly foolish"" comments on Partygate before the vote. Speaking to backbenchers in the 1922 Committee, Johnson reportedly defended his appearance at leaving dos that led some Downing Street staff to receive fines for breaking lockdown rules saying he would ""do it again"". Clacton MP Watling says: ""We all made sacrifices during lockdown. ""Sadly I lost one of my sisters and I wasn't able to see her as much as I'd liked because of lockdown. ""Now, I understand the feelings of people out there who went through quite some privation."" Reality Check In
December 2018, Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke to the BBC about the result of the
confidence vote in Theresa May. The
then prime minister won the vote with 63% of Conservative MPs
backing her, somewhat better than the 59% who supported Boris Johnson last
night. At the time,external, Rees-Mogg described the 2018 verdict as âa terrible result for the
prime minister... The prime minister must realise that under all constitutional
norms she ought to go and see the Queen urgently and resign.â However,he described,externalJohnsonâs win â with a smaller majority than May â as âa
good victory for the prime minister â he won comfortably â and now he is
getting on with businessâ. On 6 June on Sky News, Rees-Mogg said of his earlier comments on May: âEveryone said to me
afterwards that was absolute nonsense and I had to eat a good deal of my own
words.â Jenny KumahReporting from Tiverton Chris Williams wants a ""better leader"" Tiverton is an ordinary market town in a
traditional rural part of Devon, but around a month a go it was at the centre
of an extraordinary political story. The Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin the House of Commons. And on 23 June, people living here
will get to vote for their next MP. So, how are people here feeling about last
night's confidence vote in the PM? Itâs market day here in Tiverton and shopper
Chris Williams says sheâs voted Conservative in the past. âI donât think Boris has much longer to be
our Prime Minister. Itâs regretful but letâs hope somebody else in the
Conservative Party will come forward and perhaps be a better leader."" Sultan Barak wants the PM to stay Out on the High Street, barber Sultan Barak thinks the Tories should move on from Partygate. âHeâs done more than enough, he works hard and is a good prime minister,â Mr Barak said, adding that the PM should stay. Tiverton and Honiton has been a Conservative seat for decades. Neil Parish won with a majority of 24,000 in the 2019 election. But opposition parties are hoping to change all that in the by-election later this month. Jessica ParkerBrussels correspondent Unionists say the protocol has effectively created a border in the sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain Boris Johnson may now
hope to be seen to be getting on with the business of government but itâs
emerged that a much talked about piece of legislation has been delayed. Tomorrow was pencilled in for the publication of a bill to allow ministers to
potentially override parts of a treaty governing post-Brexit arrangements for
Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was an agreement that Boris
Johnson signed up to, with the EU - but the UK now argues itâs not working and needs
fundamental changes. While Brussels accepts itâs causing trade disruption, on
goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, it wants any changes to be
within the terms of the treaty. The impasse saw Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
announce plans to override parts of the protocol but the billâs first reading
has now been pushed back until at least Thursday or even next week. Whitehall sources
say thatâs because the legal text isnât quite ready. Itâs a controversial piece
of legislation that Tory MP and former minister Jesse Norman said
yesterday would be economically damaging and illegal, as he withdrew his support
for the Prime Minister. However the Democratic Unionist Party, who are deeply
unhappy with the protocol, today warned Conservative MPs not to oppose the plans. This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson survived last night's attempt to oust him from Number 10. Speaking to a Financial Times event, the Ukrainian President said he was glad not to have lost an ""important ally"". The pair have formed a close relationship since Russia launched its invasion, with many voters telling the BBC yesterday and today this was the quality of Johnson's leadership they valued most at the moment. More commentary now on Boris Johnson's leadership, after a former policy adviser to David Cameron accuses the government of having ""no vision"" and heading for an ""autumn of discontent"" after yesterday's vote. Camilla Cavendish tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the PM is fond of ""talking about delivering for the people"", but insists there isn't ""anybody [who] can tell you what he is supposed to be deliveringâ. The result, she adds, is a ""deeply split"" party which will start to see a ""slow drip, drip of a loss of momentum for"" the PM over the coming months. Asked who she thinks could replace Johnson, if it comes to that, she says it can't be anyone from his cabinet because they've been ""tarnished"" defending their boss. She suggests MP Tom Tugendhat or former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, instead. âYou need somebody who [can] recognise and respect convention, which is what we haven't got at the moment."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Despite Boris Johnson's significant majority, he will now have to look over his shoulder when it comes to contentious votes and controversial policies. Will those who want him out be harder to win over? There will be efforts to pressure the prime minister to change the way he governs in the next few weeks. One former cabinet minister told me the PM needed to ""cut the culture war crap"". Within government itself there are those who want change too. One minister told me: ""We have a window to show we get itâ¦Things need to change, most of all him."" Read more from Nick here. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In theory, the prime minister is safe from another confidence vote for a year. Under the current rules of the 1922 committee, which organises leadership contests, another challenge can't happen for 12 months after the incumbent wins. But not everyone is convinced. ""All this assumption that he's safe for a year - I don't think anyone believes that,"" one backbencher told me this morning. Rebels are already talking about how they could force another vote on Boris Johnson's future. But there are big political pitfalls ahead too, which could change minds. The subject currently dominating talk among Tory MPs is the two by-elections later this month. Then there's Partygate - which isn't over yet. Parliament's privileges committee is due to look into whether the prime minister misled the House of Commons - and sources close to that process believe that could be damning for Mr Johnson. The committee is thought likely to report in the Autumn. Read more from Nick here. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the size of the opposition to the prime minister shows that a change of policy is needed on the economy. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that ""both sides need to accept the vote"". ""The prime minister's opponents have got to accept the fact that he won, and his supporters and the Prime Minister himself have got to accept that a change of policy is needed,"" he said. ""The vote last night, when nearly 150 of your own MPs vote against you, that is a sign of a big problem and I think the big problem is that we are delivering an economic policy that is not going to deliver prosperity and wealth."" He said the government should reverse tax rises such as the National Insurance increase, introduced to tackle the NHS pandemic backlog and to improve social care. ""It is not Conservative to be raising taxes, and it is undermining growth and prosperity,"" he said. Lord Frost resigned from the government in December last year, citing ""concerns about the direction of travel"", including the need to create a ""a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy"" and fears that Covid policy was too ""coercive"". Liz Truss has backed Boris Johnson after Monday's confidence vote and dismissed suggestions she is launching a leadership bid - saying she is ""100% focused"" on her role as foreign secretary. Truss says a ""clear majority"" of Tory MPs backed the prime minister and it is ""time to move on"". Work on the Ukraine invasion and the Northern Ireland protocol was ""taking up all of my time"", she says. ""We had a vote yesterday... It is time to draw a line, move forward and focus on what people want us to be talking about - housing, childcare and delivering on lower taxes,"" she adds. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who helped steer the country through the pandemic, says it was ""very disappointing"" not everyone stuck to the rules.Asked by ITV News about revelations around events held in Downing Street during the pandemic, he said: ""I think it was really important at all stages that everyone stuck to the rules, there's no question about that. ""It only worked when people stuck to them - and it's very disappointing that that wasn't the case."" Sonia Purnell, Boris Johnson's biographer, tellsBBCScotlandâs Lunchtime Livewhy Partygate has not gone away. âMy mother was in a care home, I thought she was safe.
She went into lockdown before the rest of us and I thought 'well thatâs good, sheâll
be protected'. âBut they sent out people from hospital who had Covid,
they were untested. At least one was put on her floor in the care home. âAnd everyone on her floor died, including my mother. I
was informed by e-mail. âI buried her the day before the Downing Street garden
party, and you know there were only 10 of us allowed.â Ms Purnell says it was a âdeeply traumatic experienceâ
and she says it is very difficult to come to terms with. âThe people who governed us, who we would normally want
to rely on as having our best interests at heart, were drinking
and vomiting, carrying on in a way that was totally undignified at best, almost callous in its disregard for the rest of us."" BBC Radio 5 Live We've been reporting on Boris Johnson's plan to ""draw a line"" under the Partygate saga after yesterday's no-confidence vote, but for some people it isn't that simple. Barbara Garwood, from Derby, spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live earlier about her experience of lockdown. ""For over six months, I didnât see a single person, not anybody. I was stuck in my bungalow on my own and it felt like I was in solitary confinement,"" she said. ""It felt like I'd done something wrong [but] I accepted it and I did it because it was the best thing to do to keep myself safe, but also to keep other people safe. And I did it because it was the law. ""So, to find out that people were drinking and partying... itâs just really insulting."" Boris Johnson survived a vote to oust him last night - but faces some potentially tough tests in the weeks ahead. First come two by-elections this month - contests to replace Conservative MPs who resigned. And another test is expected to take place on 6 July when Johnson is scheduled to appear before MPs on the Liaison Committee. The panel that will question Johnson has not been announced but is made up of the chairs of the Commons select committees - and some of them are prominent critics of the prime minister. Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood and Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt have both  called on Johnson to step down. Meanwhile, Environmental Audit Committee chairman Philip Dunne is known to have voted against Mr Johnson and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat is seen as a possible future leadership contender. The Newscast team got together last night to give their reaction to a day of drama as Boris Johnson battled his way through the confidence vote. There's analysis from BBC political editor Chris Mason and colleagues, reaction from key players and Theresa May in a sparkly ballgown.You can listen here. Sir Roger Gale has been an outspoken critic of Boris Johnson and, following the confidence vote, he's restating his view that the prime minister should not take the Conservatives into the next general election. But speaking to the BBC News Channel, Gale stressed ""we are not opponents of the government. We are Conservatives. We are working on a Conservative manifesto. And we are trying to deliver Conservative policies and Conservative legislation. ""It is Mr Johnson who is the problem. He doesn't seem to recognise that."" Asked whether MPs who voted against Johnson could realistically stand at the next general election with him as party leader, Gale suggests ""it is highly doubtful"" he would remain in the position beyond the autumn. He says ""none of the fundamental concerns about the prime minister"" have changed as a result of the confidence vote. As the government tries to stake out its agenda to move on from the confidence vote, Downing Street said the health secretary had updated the cabinet on the post-pandemic challenges facing the NHS. According to Downing Street's account, Sajid Javid told the meeting earlier today we had a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"" - a reference to the video rental chain that went bankrupt in 2010 as streaming services took over. Javid said the government had set the NHS a target of ""dramatically improving"" productivity and major changes were needed in areas such as the use of technology and data. It was no longer simply an option to stick to the status quo, the health secretary told colleagues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The US envoy on climate change John Kerry has warned that the war in Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to prolong global reliance on coal. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kerry criticised a number of large countries for not living up to the promises they made at the COP26 climate summit. Climate diplomats meet again today in Bonn amid new, energy security worries. If countries extend their reliance on coal in response to the war, then ""we are cooked,"" Mr Kerry said. After COP26: Are nations on track? English 'rainforests' illegally burned - campaigners Reduce demolitions to limit climate change - MPs The fragile unity shown in Glasgow last November is likely to be tested in Bonn as countries deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. Mr Kerry told the BBC that despite these drawbacks, ""as a world we are still not moving fast enough,"" to rein in the emissions of warming gases that are driving up temperatures. ""We can still win this battle,""  the former senator said, but it will require a ""wholesale elevation of effort by countries all around the world"". Mr Kerry's call was echoed by a leading Ukrainian scientist who urged delegates to speed up their transition away from fossil fuels. Dr Svitana Krakovska said oil and gas were the ""enablers of war"". Today'smeeting in Bonn,external, which will last until the end of next week, is much smaller than COP26 and is mainly a technical negotiation. It occurs halfway between the big conferences in Glasgow andCOP27,external, to be held in Egypt. The talks will be carried out by civil servants with limited political input and will review progress on a host of issues agreed in theGlasgow Climate Pact, Bluntly, not a lot. ABBC analysis showsthat across a range of issues, very little has been achieved. The world emerged from Glasgow into an energy crisis sparked by a rapid rise in the price of gas. This has been massively compounded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing problems in global supply lines. Prices for fossil energy have shot up dramatically as governments worry about security of supply. COP26 President Alok Sharma at the conclusion of talks in Glasgow - He recently told MPs that political leaders were distracted from climate issues by war and cost of living crises Governments have also been slow in submitting new carbon cutting plans as they have promised to do by September.  The list of laggards includes some very significant countries such as India, and the hosts of COP27, Egypt. Despite this, there is a belief that political leaders still see climate as a major issue, especially in the light ofdramatic heatwaves in India and Pakistan, which were linked to human use of fossil fuels. The discussions in the former West German capital will tell us if that's true. ""I think we'll see the Bonn talks as a real test for whether political will is just words,"" said Alex Scott from environmental think tank, E3G. ""Or whether there are real genuine commitments to make the changes in policy and in spending plans that are needed to address these issues."" Ukraine and Russia normally send delegates to this event, but it remains to be seen if both countries will participate. This video can not be played ""Think about us,"" says Ukrainian climate scientist Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who led the Ukrainian delegation at the approval sessions of the recent IPCC reports, says climate isn't a critical issue right now. But she hopes negotiators will recognise the role fossil fuels are playing in the war, and act with greater haste to transition away from them. ""The cause of this war, the enabler of this war is from oil and gas,"" she told BBC News. ""So this is the point for everybody to just think about this and use this opportunity to stop using so much energy and think about our way of life."" ""The global thing that has happened are these unprecedentedly high fossil fuel prices,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. ""That just means that clean energy is extremely competitive economically at the moment."" Some countries have indeed been increasing their coal production, such as India, where the government has decided to re-open more than 100 coal mines previously considered uneconomical. But in the first quarter of 2022,India also added 3 gigawatts of solar power capacity,external. That's roughly a fifth of the UK's entire solar installation, in just three months. In Europe, which hastabled plansfor a swift move away from Russian energy, many countries are seeking alternative sources of fossil fuels ahead of an anticipated energy crunch this coming winter. The worry for environmentalists is that some like Germany, are now spending money on long-term fossil infrastructure, such as therecently announced plans,externalfor new LNG terminals. This could prolong the use of natural gas and keep emissions high. The most recent assessment indicates that China, the world's largest emitter, has seen the longest decline in carbon output in at least a decade. Workers in China install solar panels at a tidal power station - green energy sources are rising rapidly even as coal production increases as well Areview of data,externalcarried out for Carbon Brief found emissions had fallen since last summer and were down 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This has happened because of last year's slowdown in the real estate market. It's continued because of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the re-introduction of lockdowns which have stemmed economic activity. There are other changes taking effect in China - production of electric cars and trucks has doubled in a year to 20% of all new vehicles. The number of wind turbines and solar farms coming on stream in the first four months of 2022 was up 100% on the record levels installed in 2021. Whilecoal production has ramped up,external, on balance, observers believe that China's emissions will fall this year, with implications for the rest of the world. Oil drilling in the Permian basis in Texas has ramped up as a result of US restrictions on Russian energy imports ""We could actually see less emissions this year because of increased prices for fossil fuels and because China's economy is in a tailspin,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, who carried out the research. By contrast the US, where President Biden has struggled to get climate legislation on the statute books, has seen another oil boom. According toanalysis,externalfrom Rystad Energy, flows of crude from the Permian basin are expected to grow by around 1 million barrels per day this year. The region in West Texas now has higher production than any country apart from Russia and Saudi Arabia. To keep this key goal of the Paris climate agreement alive, carbon emissions need to be slashed essentially in half by 2030. But recent evidence from the UK Met Office indicates that there's now afifty-fifty chanceof temporarily going past the temperature threshold in the next five years. A woman seeks some relief from scorching temperatures in India For many developing countries and small island states, an increase of 1.5C with knock on effects on sea levels poses existential questions. And they fear that the lack of political focus by richer nations on this core issue is increasing the threat. ""Fundamentally, the war and cost of living must not be used as an excuse to let the 1.5C goal slip out of reach,"" said Ambassador Conrod Hunte, from Antigua and Barbuda, who's the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States in the Bonn talks. ""And adequate, fair climate finance is intrinsic to keeping us on this pathway."" Despite the many problems, participants believe there are some grounds for cautious optimism. This energy crisis has made discussions about heat pumps and electric vehicles part of the mainstream in a way the COPs have failed to do. Thesuccess of climate-focussed candidatesin Australia's recent election indicates that voters may be more attuned to voices who are connecting the global crises to rising temperatures. The Bonn talks could also be a moment when addressing climate become key to dealing with these other challenges as well. ""There are a number of interlinking crises right now, and it is possible for governments to seize this opening to tackle these crises, and take advantage of the opportunities, and build the kind of co-operation globally that's needed,"" said David Waskow, from the World Resources Institute.

"Cancelled flights and delays at airports are fuelling anxiety among UK holidaymakers ahead of the key summer season, travel agents have warned. Advantage Travel Partnership, a network of travel agents, said 30% of calls to its members were from people worried about future bookings. Thousands of travellers are thought to be stuck abroad after flight cancellations over the Jubilee weekend. The disruption is being driven by staff shortages across the aviation industry. The problems are taking time to resolve and Advantage's chief executive warned there were ""no guarantees"" the situation would have improved by the summer. ""Thirty per cent of everything my members are dealing with right now are calls from very anxious holidaymakers who have bookings, whose travel plans, as far as we know right now, will take place, but they are anxious because obviously they're hearing all [about] the disruption,"" said Julia Lo Bue-Said. Ms Bue-Said said airlines were already employing new staff, many of whom were already undergoing training, and that she hoped the industry would be ready by the busy summer period. However, Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, a union representing staff working in airports and across aviation engineering, said recent cancellations were having a ""really damaging impact"" on people's confidence. ""It would be difficult to give anybody the confidence at the present minute, that we are going to be okay by the school holidays in July,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. A sustainable long-term plan for the industry if the problems are to be resolved, he said, including better pay and conditions for workers in the sector. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Firms have oversold flights and holidays - Shapps Up to two million people were scheduled to fly to and from the UK over the bank holiday weekend, and the vast majority of flights have operated as expected. But several airlines have cancelled flights, with EasyJet scrapping a further 37 journeys on Monday. According to aviation data firm Cirium, 305 flights departing the UK were cancelled out of total of 10,662 scheduled flights over the Jubilee weekend. Most journeys - some 114 flights - were axed on Sunday and the airports worst affected were London Gatwick, London Luton and Bristol. EasyJet cancelled the most flights on Sunday, totalling 64, while Wizz Air cancelled 15 departing flights and BA axed eight. Families have been particularly affected by Sunday's disruption, with children stranded abroad as schools return and the exam season begins. Cirium said 189 international flights were cancelled to the UK over the long weekend, with the majority from the Netherlands (39 flights), Spain and the Canary Islands (24), France (24) and Germany (21). Airlines are being blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage following steep staff cuts during the height of Covid when travel ground to a halt. But industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the  pandemic. It has also called for immigration rules on hiring overseas workers to be relaxed to plug staff shortages, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ruled out such a move. Mr Shapps said the government had been clear that it was up to industry leaders to tackle the problems, which were also seen at Easter, and accused airlines ofhaving ""seriously oversold flights and holidays"". Before Covid, airports and airlines across Britain employed around 140,000 people, but since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone. Mr Clancy, of the Prospect union, said the government was ""culpable"" for withdrawing pandemic-related support from airlines too soon. But airlines had cut too many jobs, he said, and now needed to find ways to retain and recruit more workers. ""Ultimately this means fixing pay and conditions which have deteriorated significantly in recent years,"" Mr Clancy said. ""The problems we are seeing today are the result of a failed business model, unable to cope with any level of stress in the system. ""Unless the government and employers can come up with a sustainable long term plan for the aviation industry, that supports jobs and skills, then it is hard to see the situation improving."" The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) said despite the recent disruption the ""vast majority of people"" have been able to fly and it expected that to be the case for the summer. ABTA urged passengers to follow advice from airlines and airports for when to arrive for flights, as ""many are arriving well before check-in begins which puts additional pressure on airport services"". Jen Kassel is currently stranded in Spain with her partner and three young children after her EasyJet flight was cancelled on Sunday. She said the family had been given no explanation, but had been offered accommodation at a hotel in Benalmadena. ""The kids were really stressed,"" she said. Nikolai Brooks and his wife Vicky, who live near Brighton, have been stuck at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam since Saturday after their EasyJet flight was cancelled. Their new flight for Monday evening has already been delayed by three hours. They have had to pay for two extra nights in a hotel near the airport, which has cost them about Â£600, not including food, Mr Brooks told the BBC. ""We didn't even get an email through that it had been cancelled,"" he said. ""It's more frustrating for my wife, she's a teacher and she was due back for today."" In a statement, EasyJet said it was ""very sorry"" for flights being cancelled and said the disruption was caused by ""the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""Customers are being provided with options to rebook or receive a refund, as well as hotel accommodation and meals where required, along with information on how to arrange this quickly online or via the app,"" a spokeswoman said.

"This video can not be played The moment the veterans were reunited with their former interpreter A group of former soldiers have been reunited with their Afghan interpreter after winning a legal battle to allow him to settle in the UK. The interpreter - who the BBC is calling Abdul - went into hiding after being turned away from evacuation flights following the Taliban takeover. The Mercian Regiment veterans felt he was ""left behind"" andsuccessfully forced a government U-turn. Seeing him again ""brought back the brotherhood"", one said. Josh Roberts, Paul Standen, Sam Knight and Vance Bacon-Sharratt - from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire - said they spent months under fire together with Abdul in Helmand Province. After international forces withdrew last year, the Taliban quickly regained control of the country. Many Afghans who worked for British forces were resettled in the UK via the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme.

Their planned rendezvous at London Bridge station is no longer possible because the Jubilee line to north Greenwich station is not running. ""We've made it to London where we couldn't come for two years because of Covid, and now we have, we're not going to get to see them at all because the Tube strike."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the strike was ""incredibly frustrating and disappointing."" ""The only people being punished are Londoners,"" he said. ""I know the RMT are unhappy with
the deal we have from the government who attached many strings - Iâm unhappy
too - but the RMT should be working with me to remove these strings rather than

Itâs like squeezing in, so thatâs a big problem [â¦] someone stepping on him.â She added: âItâs really difficult and Iâm waiting for my friend as well and she canât get the train so thatâs taking ages as well, so itâs a disaster because I need to waitâ.

Elsewhere, the Mall continues to be busy - although not with traffic. The roads around central London are busier than normal. However, they are currently not heavily congested. Sam FrancisBBC News, London More than 60% of London Tube stations are still open and many services are running despite about 4,000 station staff walking out at midnight, according to transport bosses. Transport for London said 170 stations remained open as of midday today, out of a possible 272. Some of these stations have a limited limited service running from them as the Circle, Victoria and Waterloo & City lines are all closed, while the Bakerloo, Central, District, Hammersmith & City, Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly have also all been affected.

"Boris Johnson remains as Conservative leader after winning a vote of his own MPs The MPs voted by 211 to 148 to keep him as party leader and prime minister At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he says he wants to ""draw a line"" under his problems Supporters - and some opponents - of the PM also say it's time to move on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss emphatically backs the PM and dismisses suggestions of a leadership bid ""I think [the PM] won the vote comprehensively,"" says Johnson critic Andrea Leadsom But former leader Lord Hague says the damage done to Johnson is severe Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" that Johnson remains PM Edited by Marie Jackson That's it for now but if you still want more, follow our latest news storyhere. Our live coverage today was written by Joseph Lee, Sam Hancock, Alex Kleiderman and Craig Hutchison. It was edited by Owen Amos and Marie Jackson. The bunting came down at No 10 as Boris Johnson promised a renewed focus on the government's agenda We're bringing our live coverage of the fall-out from last night's confidence vote to a close shortly. But here's a round-up of what we learned today: Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent There was a sense of resignation in the centre of Brecon after Conservative MPs voted to back Boris Johnson. âItâs almost a case of better the devil you know really,â one man told me. We heard the sentiment more than once from people who didnât see an obvious alternative leader in a seat the Tories reclaimed from the Liberal Democrats in 2019. Dawn McIntosh says she is ""on the fence"" about Boris Johnson but is sticking with his party At her carpet and flooring business, Youngs, in the town
centre, Dawn McIntosh said she would stick with the Conservatives. She was âon the fenceâ about Johnson, but thought ânow
would definitely be the wrong timeâ to change the leader. Malcolm MacDonald, whose family have a fish stall in the
town market, said the prime minister had been the subject of a âwitch huntâ. âJohnson has got a lot of faults, but so has everybody,â he
said. âHe looks like a clown, but heâs not as big a clown as
everyone thinks he is.â Malcolm MacDonald: ""Heâs not as big a clown as everyone thinks he is"" Giles Watling is pictured here in 2014 with former prime minister David Cameron Giles Watling, one of the Tory MPs who sided against Boris Johnson on Monday, says the prime minister made some ""slightly foolish"" comments on Partygate before the vote. Speaking to backbenchers in the 1922 Committee, Johnson reportedly defended his appearance at leaving dos that led some Downing Street staff to receive fines for breaking lockdown rules saying he would ""do it again"". Clacton MP Watling says: ""We all made sacrifices during lockdown. ""Sadly I lost one of my sisters and I wasn't able to see her as much as I'd liked because of lockdown. ""Now, I understand the feelings of people out there who went through quite some privation."" Reality Check In
December 2018, Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke to the BBC about the result of the
confidence vote in Theresa May. The
then prime minister won the vote with 63% of Conservative MPs
backing her, somewhat better than the 59% who supported Boris Johnson last
night. At the time,external, Rees-Mogg described the 2018 verdict as âa terrible result for the
prime minister... The prime minister must realise that under all constitutional
norms she ought to go and see the Queen urgently and resign.â However,he described,externalJohnsonâs win â with a smaller majority than May â as âa
good victory for the prime minister â he won comfortably â and now he is
getting on with businessâ. On 6 June on Sky News, Rees-Mogg said of his earlier comments on May: âEveryone said to me
afterwards that was absolute nonsense and I had to eat a good deal of my own
words.â Jenny KumahReporting from Tiverton Chris Williams wants a ""better leader"" Tiverton is an ordinary market town in a
traditional rural part of Devon, but around a month a go it was at the centre
of an extraordinary political story. The Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin the House of Commons. And on 23 June, people living here
will get to vote for their next MP. So, how are people here feeling about last
night's confidence vote in the PM? Itâs market day here in Tiverton and shopper
Chris Williams says sheâs voted Conservative in the past. âI donât think Boris has much longer to be
our Prime Minister. Itâs regretful but letâs hope somebody else in the
Conservative Party will come forward and perhaps be a better leader."" Sultan Barak wants the PM to stay Out on the High Street, barber Sultan Barak thinks the Tories should move on from Partygate. âHeâs done more than enough, he works hard and is a good prime minister,â Mr Barak said, adding that the PM should stay. Tiverton and Honiton has been a Conservative seat for decades. Neil Parish won with a majority of 24,000 in the 2019 election. But opposition parties are hoping to change all that in the by-election later this month. Jessica ParkerBrussels correspondent Unionists say the protocol has effectively created a border in the sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain Boris Johnson may now
hope to be seen to be getting on with the business of government but itâs
emerged that a much talked about piece of legislation has been delayed. Tomorrow was pencilled in for the publication of a bill to allow ministers to
potentially override parts of a treaty governing post-Brexit arrangements for
Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was an agreement that Boris
Johnson signed up to, with the EU - but the UK now argues itâs not working and needs
fundamental changes. While Brussels accepts itâs causing trade disruption, on
goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, it wants any changes to be
within the terms of the treaty. The impasse saw Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
announce plans to override parts of the protocol but the billâs first reading
has now been pushed back until at least Thursday or even next week. Whitehall sources
say thatâs because the legal text isnât quite ready. Itâs a controversial piece
of legislation that Tory MP and former minister Jesse Norman said
yesterday would be economically damaging and illegal, as he withdrew his support
for the Prime Minister. However the Democratic Unionist Party, who are deeply
unhappy with the protocol, today warned Conservative MPs not to oppose the plans. This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson survived last night's attempt to oust him from Number 10. Speaking to a Financial Times event, the Ukrainian President said he was glad not to have lost an ""important ally"". The pair have formed a close relationship since Russia launched its invasion, with many voters telling the BBC yesterday and today this was the quality of Johnson's leadership they valued most at the moment. More commentary now on Boris Johnson's leadership, after a former policy adviser to David Cameron accuses the government of having ""no vision"" and heading for an ""autumn of discontent"" after yesterday's vote. Camilla Cavendish tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the PM is fond of ""talking about delivering for the people"", but insists there isn't ""anybody [who] can tell you what he is supposed to be deliveringâ. The result, she adds, is a ""deeply split"" party which will start to see a ""slow drip, drip of a loss of momentum for"" the PM over the coming months. Asked who she thinks could replace Johnson, if it comes to that, she says it can't be anyone from his cabinet because they've been ""tarnished"" defending their boss. She suggests MP Tom Tugendhat or former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, instead. âYou need somebody who [can] recognise and respect convention, which is what we haven't got at the moment."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Despite Boris Johnson's significant majority, he will now have to look over his shoulder when it comes to contentious votes and controversial policies. Will those who want him out be harder to win over? There will be efforts to pressure the prime minister to change the way he governs in the next few weeks. One former cabinet minister told me the PM needed to ""cut the culture war crap"". Within government itself there are those who want change too. One minister told me: ""We have a window to show we get itâ¦Things need to change, most of all him."" Read more from Nick here. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In theory, the prime minister is safe from another confidence vote for a year. Under the current rules of the 1922 committee, which organises leadership contests, another challenge can't happen for 12 months after the incumbent wins. But not everyone is convinced. ""All this assumption that he's safe for a year - I don't think anyone believes that,"" one backbencher told me this morning. Rebels are already talking about how they could force another vote on Boris Johnson's future. But there are big political pitfalls ahead too, which could change minds. The subject currently dominating talk among Tory MPs is the two by-elections later this month. Then there's Partygate - which isn't over yet. Parliament's privileges committee is due to look into whether the prime minister misled the House of Commons - and sources close to that process believe that could be damning for Mr Johnson. The committee is thought likely to report in the Autumn. Read more from Nick here. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the size of the opposition to the prime minister shows that a change of policy is needed on the economy. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that ""both sides need to accept the vote"". ""The prime minister's opponents have got to accept the fact that he won, and his supporters and the Prime Minister himself have got to accept that a change of policy is needed,"" he said. ""The vote last night, when nearly 150 of your own MPs vote against you, that is a sign of a big problem and I think the big problem is that we are delivering an economic policy that is not going to deliver prosperity and wealth."" He said the government should reverse tax rises such as the National Insurance increase, introduced to tackle the NHS pandemic backlog and to improve social care. ""It is not Conservative to be raising taxes, and it is undermining growth and prosperity,"" he said. Lord Frost resigned from the government in December last year, citing ""concerns about the direction of travel"", including the need to create a ""a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy"" and fears that Covid policy was too ""coercive"". Liz Truss has backed Boris Johnson after Monday's confidence vote and dismissed suggestions she is launching a leadership bid - saying she is ""100% focused"" on her role as foreign secretary. Truss says a ""clear majority"" of Tory MPs backed the prime minister and it is ""time to move on"". Work on the Ukraine invasion and the Northern Ireland protocol was ""taking up all of my time"", she says. ""We had a vote yesterday... It is time to draw a line, move forward and focus on what people want us to be talking about - housing, childcare and delivering on lower taxes,"" she adds. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who helped steer the country through the pandemic, says it was ""very disappointing"" not everyone stuck to the rules.Asked by ITV News about revelations around events held in Downing Street during the pandemic, he said: ""I think it was really important at all stages that everyone stuck to the rules, there's no question about that. ""It only worked when people stuck to them - and it's very disappointing that that wasn't the case."" Sonia Purnell, Boris Johnson's biographer, tellsBBCScotlandâs Lunchtime Livewhy Partygate has not gone away. âMy mother was in a care home, I thought she was safe.
She went into lockdown before the rest of us and I thought 'well thatâs good, sheâll
be protected'. âBut they sent out people from hospital who had Covid,
they were untested. At least one was put on her floor in the care home. âAnd everyone on her floor died, including my mother. I
was informed by e-mail. âI buried her the day before the Downing Street garden
party, and you know there were only 10 of us allowed.â Ms Purnell says it was a âdeeply traumatic experienceâ
and she says it is very difficult to come to terms with. âThe people who governed us, who we would normally want
to rely on as having our best interests at heart, were drinking
and vomiting, carrying on in a way that was totally undignified at best, almost callous in its disregard for the rest of us."" BBC Radio 5 Live We've been reporting on Boris Johnson's plan to ""draw a line"" under the Partygate saga after yesterday's no-confidence vote, but for some people it isn't that simple. Barbara Garwood, from Derby, spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live earlier about her experience of lockdown. ""For over six months, I didnât see a single person, not anybody. I was stuck in my bungalow on my own and it felt like I was in solitary confinement,"" she said. ""It felt like I'd done something wrong [but] I accepted it and I did it because it was the best thing to do to keep myself safe, but also to keep other people safe. And I did it because it was the law. ""So, to find out that people were drinking and partying... itâs just really insulting."" Boris Johnson survived a vote to oust him last night - but faces some potentially tough tests in the weeks ahead. First come two by-elections this month - contests to replace Conservative MPs who resigned. And another test is expected to take place on 6 July when Johnson is scheduled to appear before MPs on the Liaison Committee. The panel that will question Johnson has not been announced but is made up of the chairs of the Commons select committees - and some of them are prominent critics of the prime minister. Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood and Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt have both  called on Johnson to step down. Meanwhile, Environmental Audit Committee chairman Philip Dunne is known to have voted against Mr Johnson and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat is seen as a possible future leadership contender. The Newscast team got together last night to give their reaction to a day of drama as Boris Johnson battled his way through the confidence vote. There's analysis from BBC political editor Chris Mason and colleagues, reaction from key players and Theresa May in a sparkly ballgown.You can listen here. Sir Roger Gale has been an outspoken critic of Boris Johnson and, following the confidence vote, he's restating his view that the prime minister should not take the Conservatives into the next general election. But speaking to the BBC News Channel, Gale stressed ""we are not opponents of the government. We are Conservatives. We are working on a Conservative manifesto. And we are trying to deliver Conservative policies and Conservative legislation. ""It is Mr Johnson who is the problem. He doesn't seem to recognise that."" Asked whether MPs who voted against Johnson could realistically stand at the next general election with him as party leader, Gale suggests ""it is highly doubtful"" he would remain in the position beyond the autumn. He says ""none of the fundamental concerns about the prime minister"" have changed as a result of the confidence vote. As the government tries to stake out its agenda to move on from the confidence vote, Downing Street said the health secretary had updated the cabinet on the post-pandemic challenges facing the NHS. According to Downing Street's account, Sajid Javid told the meeting earlier today we had a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"" - a reference to the video rental chain that went bankrupt in 2010 as streaming services took over. Javid said the government had set the NHS a target of ""dramatically improving"" productivity and major changes were needed in areas such as the use of technology and data. It was no longer simply an option to stick to the status quo, the health secretary told colleagues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson remains as Conservative leader after winning a vote of his own MPs The MPs voted by 211 to 148 to keep him as party leader and prime minister At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he says he wants to ""draw a line"" under his problems Supporters - and some opponents - of the PM also say it's time to move on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss emphatically backs the PM and dismisses suggestions of a leadership bid ""I think [the PM] won the vote comprehensively,"" says Johnson critic Andrea Leadsom But former leader Lord Hague says the damage done to Johnson is severe Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky says he is ""very happy"" that Johnson remains PM Edited by Marie Jackson That's it for now but if you still want more, follow our latest news storyhere. Our live coverage today was written by Joseph Lee, Sam Hancock, Alex Kleiderman and Craig Hutchison. It was edited by Owen Amos and Marie Jackson. The bunting came down at No 10 as Boris Johnson promised a renewed focus on the government's agenda We're bringing our live coverage of the fall-out from last night's confidence vote to a close shortly. But here's a round-up of what we learned today: Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent There was a sense of resignation in the centre of Brecon after Conservative MPs voted to back Boris Johnson. âItâs almost a case of better the devil you know really,â one man told me. We heard the sentiment more than once from people who didnât see an obvious alternative leader in a seat the Tories reclaimed from the Liberal Democrats in 2019. Dawn McIntosh says she is ""on the fence"" about Boris Johnson but is sticking with his party At her carpet and flooring business, Youngs, in the town
centre, Dawn McIntosh said she would stick with the Conservatives. She was âon the fenceâ about Johnson, but thought ânow
would definitely be the wrong timeâ to change the leader. Malcolm MacDonald, whose family have a fish stall in the
town market, said the prime minister had been the subject of a âwitch huntâ. âJohnson has got a lot of faults, but so has everybody,â he
said. âHe looks like a clown, but heâs not as big a clown as
everyone thinks he is.â Malcolm MacDonald: ""Heâs not as big a clown as everyone thinks he is"" Giles Watling is pictured here in 2014 with former prime minister David Cameron Giles Watling, one of the Tory MPs who sided against Boris Johnson on Monday, says the prime minister made some ""slightly foolish"" comments on Partygate before the vote. Speaking to backbenchers in the 1922 Committee, Johnson reportedly defended his appearance at leaving dos that led some Downing Street staff to receive fines for breaking lockdown rules saying he would ""do it again"". Clacton MP Watling says: ""We all made sacrifices during lockdown. ""Sadly I lost one of my sisters and I wasn't able to see her as much as I'd liked because of lockdown. ""Now, I understand the feelings of people out there who went through quite some privation."" Reality Check In
December 2018, Jacob Rees-Mogg spoke to the BBC about the result of the
confidence vote in Theresa May. The
then prime minister won the vote with 63% of Conservative MPs
backing her, somewhat better than the 59% who supported Boris Johnson last
night. At the time,external, Rees-Mogg described the 2018 verdict as âa terrible result for the
prime minister... The prime minister must realise that under all constitutional
norms she ought to go and see the Queen urgently and resign.â However,he described,externalJohnsonâs win â with a smaller majority than May â as âa
good victory for the prime minister â he won comfortably â and now he is
getting on with businessâ. On 6 June on Sky News, Rees-Mogg said of his earlier comments on May: âEveryone said to me
afterwards that was absolute nonsense and I had to eat a good deal of my own
words.â Jenny KumahReporting from Tiverton Chris Williams wants a ""better leader"" Tiverton is an ordinary market town in a
traditional rural part of Devon, but around a month a go it was at the centre
of an extraordinary political story. The Conservative MPNeil Parish resigned after admitting watching pornographyin the House of Commons. And on 23 June, people living here
will get to vote for their next MP. So, how are people here feeling about last
night's confidence vote in the PM? Itâs market day here in Tiverton and shopper
Chris Williams says sheâs voted Conservative in the past. âI donât think Boris has much longer to be
our Prime Minister. Itâs regretful but letâs hope somebody else in the
Conservative Party will come forward and perhaps be a better leader."" Sultan Barak wants the PM to stay Out on the High Street, barber Sultan Barak thinks the Tories should move on from Partygate. âHeâs done more than enough, he works hard and is a good prime minister,â Mr Barak said, adding that the PM should stay. Tiverton and Honiton has been a Conservative seat for decades. Neil Parish won with a majority of 24,000 in the 2019 election. But opposition parties are hoping to change all that in the by-election later this month. Jessica ParkerBrussels correspondent Unionists say the protocol has effectively created a border in the sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain Boris Johnson may now
hope to be seen to be getting on with the business of government but itâs
emerged that a much talked about piece of legislation has been delayed. Tomorrow was pencilled in for the publication of a bill to allow ministers to
potentially override parts of a treaty governing post-Brexit arrangements for
Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was an agreement that Boris
Johnson signed up to, with the EU - but the UK now argues itâs not working and needs
fundamental changes. While Brussels accepts itâs causing trade disruption, on
goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, it wants any changes to be
within the terms of the treaty. The impasse saw Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
announce plans to override parts of the protocol but the billâs first reading
has now been pushed back until at least Thursday or even next week. Whitehall sources
say thatâs because the legal text isnât quite ready. Itâs a controversial piece
of legislation that Tory MP and former minister Jesse Norman said
yesterday would be economically damaging and illegal, as he withdrew his support
for the Prime Minister. However the Democratic Unionist Party, who are deeply
unhappy with the protocol, today warned Conservative MPs not to oppose the plans. This video can not be played Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier he was ""very happy"" Boris Johnson survived last night's attempt to oust him from Number 10. Speaking to a Financial Times event, the Ukrainian President said he was glad not to have lost an ""important ally"". The pair have formed a close relationship since Russia launched its invasion, with many voters telling the BBC yesterday and today this was the quality of Johnson's leadership they valued most at the moment. More commentary now on Boris Johnson's leadership, after a former policy adviser to David Cameron accuses the government of having ""no vision"" and heading for an ""autumn of discontent"" after yesterday's vote. Camilla Cavendish tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the PM is fond of ""talking about delivering for the people"", but insists there isn't ""anybody [who] can tell you what he is supposed to be deliveringâ. The result, she adds, is a ""deeply split"" party which will start to see a ""slow drip, drip of a loss of momentum for"" the PM over the coming months. Asked who she thinks could replace Johnson, if it comes to that, she says it can't be anyone from his cabinet because they've been ""tarnished"" defending their boss. She suggests MP Tom Tugendhat or former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, instead. âYou need somebody who [can] recognise and respect convention, which is what we haven't got at the moment."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Despite Boris Johnson's significant majority, he will now have to look over his shoulder when it comes to contentious votes and controversial policies. Will those who want him out be harder to win over? There will be efforts to pressure the prime minister to change the way he governs in the next few weeks. One former cabinet minister told me the PM needed to ""cut the culture war crap"". Within government itself there are those who want change too. One minister told me: ""We have a window to show we get itâ¦Things need to change, most of all him."" Read more from Nick here. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In theory, the prime minister is safe from another confidence vote for a year. Under the current rules of the 1922 committee, which organises leadership contests, another challenge can't happen for 12 months after the incumbent wins. But not everyone is convinced. ""All this assumption that he's safe for a year - I don't think anyone believes that,"" one backbencher told me this morning. Rebels are already talking about how they could force another vote on Boris Johnson's future. But there are big political pitfalls ahead too, which could change minds. The subject currently dominating talk among Tory MPs is the two by-elections later this month. Then there's Partygate - which isn't over yet. Parliament's privileges committee is due to look into whether the prime minister misled the House of Commons - and sources close to that process believe that could be damning for Mr Johnson. The committee is thought likely to report in the Autumn. Read more from Nick here. Former Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the size of the opposition to the prime minister shows that a change of policy is needed on the economy. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that ""both sides need to accept the vote"". ""The prime minister's opponents have got to accept the fact that he won, and his supporters and the Prime Minister himself have got to accept that a change of policy is needed,"" he said. ""The vote last night, when nearly 150 of your own MPs vote against you, that is a sign of a big problem and I think the big problem is that we are delivering an economic policy that is not going to deliver prosperity and wealth."" He said the government should reverse tax rises such as the National Insurance increase, introduced to tackle the NHS pandemic backlog and to improve social care. ""It is not Conservative to be raising taxes, and it is undermining growth and prosperity,"" he said. Lord Frost resigned from the government in December last year, citing ""concerns about the direction of travel"", including the need to create a ""a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy"" and fears that Covid policy was too ""coercive"". Liz Truss has backed Boris Johnson after Monday's confidence vote and dismissed suggestions she is launching a leadership bid - saying she is ""100% focused"" on her role as foreign secretary. Truss says a ""clear majority"" of Tory MPs backed the prime minister and it is ""time to move on"". Work on the Ukraine invasion and the Northern Ireland protocol was ""taking up all of my time"", she says. ""We had a vote yesterday... It is time to draw a line, move forward and focus on what people want us to be talking about - housing, childcare and delivering on lower taxes,"" she adds. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who helped steer the country through the pandemic, says it was ""very disappointing"" not everyone stuck to the rules.Asked by ITV News about revelations around events held in Downing Street during the pandemic, he said: ""I think it was really important at all stages that everyone stuck to the rules, there's no question about that. ""It only worked when people stuck to them - and it's very disappointing that that wasn't the case."" Sonia Purnell, Boris Johnson's biographer, tellsBBCScotlandâs Lunchtime Livewhy Partygate has not gone away. âMy mother was in a care home, I thought she was safe.
She went into lockdown before the rest of us and I thought 'well thatâs good, sheâll
be protected'. âBut they sent out people from hospital who had Covid,
they were untested. At least one was put on her floor in the care home. âAnd everyone on her floor died, including my mother. I
was informed by e-mail. âI buried her the day before the Downing Street garden
party, and you know there were only 10 of us allowed.â Ms Purnell says it was a âdeeply traumatic experienceâ
and she says it is very difficult to come to terms with. âThe people who governed us, who we would normally want
to rely on as having our best interests at heart, were drinking
and vomiting, carrying on in a way that was totally undignified at best, almost callous in its disregard for the rest of us."" BBC Radio 5 Live We've been reporting on Boris Johnson's plan to ""draw a line"" under the Partygate saga after yesterday's no-confidence vote, but for some people it isn't that simple. Barbara Garwood, from Derby, spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live earlier about her experience of lockdown. ""For over six months, I didnât see a single person, not anybody. I was stuck in my bungalow on my own and it felt like I was in solitary confinement,"" she said. ""It felt like I'd done something wrong [but] I accepted it and I did it because it was the best thing to do to keep myself safe, but also to keep other people safe. And I did it because it was the law. ""So, to find out that people were drinking and partying... itâs just really insulting."" Boris Johnson survived a vote to oust him last night - but faces some potentially tough tests in the weeks ahead. First come two by-elections this month - contests to replace Conservative MPs who resigned. And another test is expected to take place on 6 July when Johnson is scheduled to appear before MPs on the Liaison Committee. The panel that will question Johnson has not been announced but is made up of the chairs of the Commons select committees - and some of them are prominent critics of the prime minister. Defence Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood and Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt have both  called on Johnson to step down. Meanwhile, Environmental Audit Committee chairman Philip Dunne is known to have voted against Mr Johnson and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat is seen as a possible future leadership contender. The Newscast team got together last night to give their reaction to a day of drama as Boris Johnson battled his way through the confidence vote. There's analysis from BBC political editor Chris Mason and colleagues, reaction from key players and Theresa May in a sparkly ballgown.You can listen here. Sir Roger Gale has been an outspoken critic of Boris Johnson and, following the confidence vote, he's restating his view that the prime minister should not take the Conservatives into the next general election. But speaking to the BBC News Channel, Gale stressed ""we are not opponents of the government. We are Conservatives. We are working on a Conservative manifesto. And we are trying to deliver Conservative policies and Conservative legislation. ""It is Mr Johnson who is the problem. He doesn't seem to recognise that."" Asked whether MPs who voted against Johnson could realistically stand at the next general election with him as party leader, Gale suggests ""it is highly doubtful"" he would remain in the position beyond the autumn. He says ""none of the fundamental concerns about the prime minister"" have changed as a result of the confidence vote. As the government tries to stake out its agenda to move on from the confidence vote, Downing Street said the health secretary had updated the cabinet on the post-pandemic challenges facing the NHS. According to Downing Street's account, Sajid Javid told the meeting earlier today we had a ""Blockbuster healthcare system in the age of Netflix"" - a reference to the video rental chain that went bankrupt in 2010 as streaming services took over. Javid said the government had set the NHS a target of ""dramatically improving"" productivity and major changes were needed in areas such as the use of technology and data. It was no longer simply an option to stick to the status quo, the health secretary told colleagues. Â© 2025 BBC.

The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region. Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

Anna Melnichuk, the deputy leader of Konstantinovka city council, has been outlining the problems faced in her city and neighbouring areas. She told the BBC that while the city, north of Donetsk, is being protected by the Ukrainian army, conditions are difficult. ""We have some problems with gas, and water as well."" She added that the government and local council were in touch with organisations which were providing food, but deliveries by car were difficult due to problems with petrol. When asked about the conditions in Severodonetsk, where fighting continues, Melnichuk said: ""Yes, the situation is truly difficult, but not just because of war actions, but because of problems with water, with food, with electricity."" About 300 Ukrainian civilians, mostly journalists and public activists, are being kept in improvised prisons in Kherson, and 300 more in other occupied settlements in the Kherson region, according to the Ukrainian president's envoy for Crimea, Tamila Tasheva. Tasheva said there are about 600 people in the region who are ""actually hostages and are being held in specially equipped basements, actually jails,"" Interfax news agency reported. ""They are kept in inhumane conditions and tortured. Witnesses report cries that could be heard from the places were our citizens are subjected to such illegal actions,"" she told a news briefing. She said some civilians are being moved from the Kherson region to Crimea and being kept as ""civilian hostages and prisoners of war"". ""Some people who left Mariupol were detained during filtration on the administrative border with Crimea and were taken to the Simferopol remand centre,"" she said. If you are just joining us, or looking for a recap, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine:  British troops in World War One going up the line to their trenches The conflict in parts of Ukraine has been described asreminiscent of the trench warfare used in World War I- but what is meant by the term? Trenches are ditches dug into the ground that offer shelter and protection against enemy fire and means both sides sacrifice mobility in order to gain protection. During World War I, trenches were developed from simple ditches into more complex systems, with a front line, known as the fire trench, the second line, known as the support trench, and a third line, known as the reserve trench. These trenches were connected by communication trenches, which allowed men to run between lines, without ever having to go over open ground. The BBC has previously been granted access to trenches being used by the Ukrainian army. The soldiers working and living in them told the BBC that they are sleeping and eating in them, while building new ones every day. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Inside Kyiv's trench defences Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv There had been much speculation about what had happened to Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner,two British men captured fighting in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Footage of Aslin shortly after his capture - his face bloodied and bruised, being interviewed by a Russian propaganda channel - led many to fear for his wellbeing. Now we know both men are alive and are being held in the occupied Donestsk Peopleâs Republic, after a video appeared of them standing in what appears to be a court. Standing alongside a third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, the pair spoke only to confirm they knew the charges against them and were happy for their case to proceed without the evidence of witnesses. Both were able to stand unaided and seemed aware of their surroundings. According to the Interfax news agency, the leader of the self-proclaimed DNR, Denis Pushilin, has said they will be charged in the âSupreme Courtâ of the region, which is not recognised internationally. The British pair are facing several âchargesâ, including violent seizure of power, acting as mercenaries and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities. It is feared the court, which is not internationally recognised, could give them the death penalty if it finds them guilty. Russia's parliament has passed two bills ending theEuropean Court of Human Rightsâ jurisdictionin Russia, after it announced it would exit the court in March amid the conflict in Ukraine. The ECHR aims to apply and protect the civil and political rights of the continent's citizens, and this previously provided a way to pursue legal and human rights cases against Russia that had either been rejected or ignored by Russian courts. One of the bills removes Russia from the court's jurisdiction and the second bill sets 15 March as the cut-off point, meaning rulings against Russia made after that date are not to be implemented, the RIA Novosti news agency reports. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe expelled Russia from the organisation on 15 March, which the ECHR is part of, in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Russia has said that it independently decided to leave the Council of Europe, with former President Dmitry Medvedev saying that Russiaâs exit from the organisation represented an opportunity to restore the death penalty, which the Council of Europeanâs rules prohibit. A Russian journalist who was fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme earlier this year says she feels Ukrainian and will change her surname as a sign of support. Marina Ovsyannikova - who says her father is Ukrainian - announced the movein a post on Facebook,external. ""I'm not a 'good Russian', I'm Ukrainian. As a sign of support of Ukraine, I intend to change the surname of Ovsyannikov to the native Tkachuk."" Formerly an editor at Russian state-controlled Channel One,she was shortly detained in Marchin Russia after she ran on to the set of the channel holding a sign saying ""no war"". She has since emigrated to Germany. James WaterhouseReporting from Kyiv âVery happyâ were two of the words President Volodymyr Zelensky used in reaction to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson surviving his vote of confidence, describing him as a âtrue friend of Ukraineâ. Itâs a sentiment echoed by many on the cobbled streets of central Kyiv, mainly because the UK government is one of the biggest supporters of the country in this war, outside the European Union and United States. Of course, peopleâs views of the British prime minister arenât shaped by domestic issues. Even before this invasion, though, Ukrainians cared deeply about the level of military aid being supplied by western allies as Russia continued to gather troops on the border. They are continuing to defend, but Russia has already taken a fifth of Ukrainian territory. As we reported earlier, military analyst Justin Crump has said conflict in parts of Ukraine is nowreminiscent of the trench warfare seen in World War One. Here's a selection of images capturing life for Ukrainian troops in trench positions on the frontline: Soldiers walk in trenches to take cover for Russian artillery strikes at an undisclosed defence position on the outskirts of the separatist region of Donetsk Ukrainian troops walk along a trench at a position on the frontline near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donbas region Ukraine's army appears to have an advantage in any given battle at the moment because they are generally defending rather than attacking, according to military analyst Justin Crump A Ukrainian servicewoman looks out of a trench at a position near a frontline in the Donetsk region Parts of Ukraine have been taken back to the trench-filled warfare of decades ago Earlier, we reported on the fighting in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. President Zelensky called them ""dead cities"" and now Severodonetsk's Mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, has been speaking to Ukrainian TV about the current situation.He warned that Russia is aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". An update from the Ukrainian armed forces earlier today also suggested that there were further Russian troops in the area. It has not yet been possible for the BBC to verify exact details of the fighting. Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

The writers were James Fitzgerald, Sam Hancock, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Emily McGarvey and Hamzah Abbas. Join us tomorrow.   We're pausing our live coverage soon, but here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today: There is no justification for Russia's brutal disregard of international law in Ukraine, the former German-Chancellor Angela Merkel has said in her first interview since leaving office last year. Merkel said that ""if we start going through the centuries and say which piece of territory belongs to whom, then we'll only have war - that's not possible at all"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously criticised Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their move to block Ukraine's admission to Nato in 2008, suggesting that it had been a clear ""miscalculation"" that emboldened Russia. Asked about rejecting Ukraine's Nato membership back then, Merkel said that if she hadn't have vetoed the move, ""Putin would do something that would not be good for Ukraine"". The World Bank has downgraded its estimate for global economic growth to 2.9% because of the conflict in Ukraine, which along with other factors, has caused a severe downturn. ""Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7% in 2021 to 2.9% in 2022 - significantly lower than 4.1% that was anticipated in January,""it said in its Global Economic Prospects report,external. ""The world economy is expected to experience its sharpest deceleration following an initial recovery from global recession in more than 80 years,"" it added. Global economic growth had recovered to 5.7% last year following the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said the bank's president, David Malpass.  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after attacks in March The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency - the UN's nuclear watchdog - has dismissed as absurd allegations by Ukraine's nuclear operator that he had lied about being invited to visit a Russian-occupied nuclear power plant there. Rafael Grossi has been trying to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which Russian forces took control of in early March. But Ukraine's nuclear operator has said a visit by the watchdog would legitimise Russia's occupation of the plant. Speaking to the BBC's Newshour, Grossi said there was a contractual obligation to allow safety inspections by his organisation. ""The government have requested us to do this. There have been statements, I believe even today, implying that... I am lying when I say this."" He added that it was not ""an invitation that can or can't be extended"", but ""an obligation"" as there is a lot of nuclear material at the plant which has not been inspected, leading to an ""abnormal"" and ""unsustainable"" situation. There is no suggestion that the Ukrainian government has accused Grossi of lying, though the country's nuclear operator, Energoatom, says that Ukraine has not invited him to visit. As we've been reporting, heavy fighting is continuing in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture for weeks. Now, officials say Ukrainian forces are finding it hard to
stave off Russian attacks in the centre of Severodonetsk but
Russia has still not taken control of the city, according to Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Earlier, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk warned thatRussia was aiming to capture the city with more troops, and said that Severdonetsk's armed forces have ""strengthened their positions and are holding the line"". Russian troops
were constantly shelling its twin city Lysychansk, and Moscow's forces were deliberately targeting areas where civilians were hiding, Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. He reiterated a call for long-range artillery to be sent to Ukraine to enable its troops to repel the Russians in the region.

Danny AeberhardEurope Regional Editor, BBC World Service As we've been reporting, Ukraine's national nuclear operator has accused the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, of lying about being invited by Ukraine to visit the Russian-occupied nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Grossi, insisted on Monday that such a visit would take place, ideally sooner rather than later, citing fears over nuclear security at the plant Ukraine's nuclear operator, Energoatom, did not mince its words. In a statement, it said it saw efforts by Grossi to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant as an attempt to legitimise Russia's occupation of the facility. It said Ukraine had not invited him to visit, and had refused permission previously. Energoatom also blamed Russia for blocking the transfer of crucial data from the plant to the IAEA. Grossi - in an impassioned address on Monday - stressed a visit was vital, saying the Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from safety systems. Russian forcestook over the plant- Europe's largest - at the start of the conflict. Russian forces now control almost all of Ukraine's easternmost region, the Russian defence minister says. 97% of Luhansk Oblast has been ""liberated"", Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the defence ministry, broadcast on state TV. Shoigu claims that residential areas of the flashpoint city of Severodonetsk are in Moscow's hands, and further attempts are being made to gain industrial areas. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the claims. There have been conflicting accounts of which army controls which territory as battles for the city continue. James FitzGeraldBBC News Russia could look to make 'micro-scale' gains in Kharkiv, says an expert Fighting
in Ukraine has settled into a rhythm reminiscent of trench warfare in World War One, says a military analyst. Justin
Crump, chief executive of security consultancy Sibylline, tells the BBC the
conflict has become âmicro-levelâ - with Russia now âlucky to capture a field
in 24 hoursâ. This is because the defending army appears to have an advantage
in any given battle at the moment. In some
places, that favours Ukrainians holding onto their territory; in others, it
suits Russian troops occupying cities theyâve captured. Crump, a
former British Army serviceman, says Russia appears to have slight momentum â
as its troops âgrind forwardâ. Moscow will want to capture Severodonetsk and
then the remainder of the eastern Donbas region in order to declare âany sort
of victoryâ. He expects
the Kremlin to set its sights Zaporizhzhia next, then make a fresh attempt at Kharkiv and look to capture Odesa on the south coast. Russiaâs
brand of attritional warfare has been seen to work, Crump says â but ânothing
is inevitableâ about what happens next. âRussiaâs
got to be able to keep paying the bill,â he says â referring to the
expense of the war, as well as the human toll. As a
result of poor tactics and other shortcomings, Russia has also shown that it
can only attack successfully on a single axis at a time, Crump claims. From the
Ukrainian perspective, high-spec weapons donations from Western nations â such as
missile-launchers recently promised by the US and UK â are no âsilver bulletâ,
says Crump, because the conflict has become less precise than that. He says
there is also the question of how long Western countries keep up their support
for Ukraine. But
Russia âcanât leave the frontline where it isâ, he adds â suggesting that
Ukraine will refuse to give up the territories currently in the hands of its
enemy. There is,
therefore, the possibility of a âfrozen conflict at bestâ. The Azovstal steelwork was for weeks under relentless Russian shelling We reported earlierthat the bodies of some Ukrainian fighters killed defending the key southern port of Mariupol from Russian forces at the Azovstal steel plant have been handed over to Kyiv. The fighters' families have said this was part of a prisoner exchange with Russia, with each side receiving 160 bodies. Of those on the Ukrainian side, more than 50 bodies were members of the Azov regiment, the families said on the Telegram messenging service. The identification process is continuing. The families added that talks are ongoing on further prisoner swaps, without giving any further details. More than 2,500 Azovstal defenders - which also include border guards, police and territorial defence - are currently being held by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier. Kyiv is seeking the handover of them all, but several leading Russian lawmakers are demanding that some of the soldiers - specifically from the Azov regiment - should be put on trial. The regiment was set up in 2014, with some of its members initially linked to far-right groups. Russia describes Azov regiment fighters as neo-Nazis - a claim denied by Ukraine, who says the unit has been reformed and is outside politics. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People hoping to find a property to rent are going to ever greater lengths to secure a home. As well as having to put up more cash in advance, they're offering landlords CVs for their children and photos of their well-behaved dogs. That's because a shortage of available homes is pushing up monthly rents, deposits and leading to bidding wars. Industry body Propertymark says the number of rentals on the books of lettings agencies has fallen sharply. Propertymark surveyed over 440 letting agency businesses, spread across 4,000 branches UK-wide and found that on average, letting agents have seen the number of available rentals on their books halve, from over 30 to just 15. One is agent Adam Kingswood, who says he's never known the market behave like this in two decades in the business. ""We will list a property and stop taking viewings after just a few hours,"" he says. He lets properties in The Park area of Nottingham, where the wide leafy streets and Victorian houses make it one of the city's most popular property spots. ""Out of those who turn up, the majority will want the property and in most cases the landlord has a choice of what tenant they want to go with,"" he says. Adam Kingswood says pets and kids are seen as a 'downside' This leads to a sort of rental beauty pageant, with desperate renters vying to be chosen by landlords. Noisy pets and children can be seen as a downside, so some parents and owners are seeking to prove they're desirable tenants by providing photos or family bios. But it's money that does most of the talking. ""Two years ago, I could count on one hand the amount of times a tenant would offer above the asking price for rent,"" says Mr Kingswood. Now people regularly offer three or even six months rent in advance or an extra Â£50 extra a month above the asking price, he said. Last month, the annual rental survey from website Rightmove found that asking rents are already at their highest ever level, and up 11% year-on-year to Â£1088 per month outside the capital. The rocketing prices are making sitting tenants anxious. Teacher Sheree Osborne moved from London to Nottingham, to save money. She loves her new flat in a converted Art Deco hotel, but she's worried that when her lease is renewed in September, she'll end up in a bidding war. Sheree Osborne is worried rising rents will push her out of her home ""I'm in a vulnerable position,"" she said. ""I don't want my landlord saying I have to move out because he wants to put the rent up Â£200. There are people willing to pay that."" Propertymark says that landlords are selling up, unhappy with increased costs and red tape. Others are switching from renting to offering holiday lets. Lou Valdini for example, had a flat in London and two more in South Yorkshire which he rented out. He's now letting them all go. ""I feel disillusioned by the sector, it was something I enjoyed and wanted to keep doing,"" he says. But during the pandemic one tenant stopped paying rent for sixteen months at the same time as behaving poorly towards fellow residents in the block. ""All that time I was paying the costs and mortgage, as well as getting complaints,"" Mr Valdini explains. It cost him around Â£20,000, he says. ""The stress was huge. And I'm not a professional big company with people working for me to sort these things. It all fell on my shoulders."" Mick Roberts is another local landlord with more than thirty properties across Nottingham. His tenants are all on housing benefits, mostly families but many pensioners. Mr Roberts says he has ""a conscience"" about keeping rent down for his tenants. He has tenants so terrified their rent will go up they are too scared to ask for repairs, he says. Parents are sleeping on the sofa of one-bed apartments with three children in the bed because they can't find nor afford a bigger house to rent, he adds. Landlord Mick Roberts says tenants fear asking for repairs But while Mr Roberts is reluctant to raise rents for those already in his houses, he admits that he asks for the market rate from any new tenant. ""I've got no loyalty to that person,"" he says. ""As time goes on, we'll build up a rapport but for now it's supply and demand."" ""There's been something like 179 new rules in the last five years,"" he says. Which means costs are rising. ""You used to be able, rightly or wrongly, to give the tenants the keys and service the boiler once a year. Now we are part landlord, part policemen, counsellor, we do debt work like a bailiff."" Changes to taxation have made letting properties less profitable at the same time as legislation regarding maintenance and energy compliance has pushed up landlords' costs. The temporary ban on evictions during the pandemic left many landlords out of pocket, meaning an anticipated ban on ""Section 21"", which allows them to evict tenants easily, is causing concern they'll be left with limited power to protect their properties. It may result in fewer landlords and more people homeless, Mr Roberts predicts. The Department for Levelling-Up, Communities and Housing said ""good landlords"" had nothing to fear from the reforms, which were designed to ""give tenants greater security to challenge unreasonable rent rises and poor practice"". ""We're supporting vulnerable renters to help them meet the rising cost of living and stay in their homes, as well as investing Â£11.5bn to build more of the affordable, quality homes this country needs - including tens of thousands for social rent,"" the spokesperson added.

"Ben (right) has been at Disneyland Paris with his brother and their extended family Ben, 17, was due home on Saturday in plenty of time to take his maths GCSE on Tuesday, but after a cancelled flight and a frantic scrabble for train tickets, he will only just make it. He is one of thousands of British holiday-makers thought to be stranded abroad, after the cancellation of more than 100 flights over the weekend. Among them are hundreds of school pupils and some teachers set to miss school on Monday after half-term. And they face an anxious journey home. ""Ben was going to have a couple of days at home to get his revision in, prepare mentally for it,"" said his mother Emma, who did not want their surnames used. After their EasyJet flight home from Paris was cancelled, the earliest flight back that the airline could provide was on Tuesday - too late. So after spending hundreds of pounds on Eurostar tickets, they are now due to arrive back at home in Stockport by 11:30 BST on Monday evening, in time for the exam on Tuesday morning. ""Hopefully he'll get there. But there's no guarantee,"" she said. And EasyJet had been ""impossible to contact and completely unhelpful"", she added. There are reports that others are even less lucky and are missing GCSE or A-level exams altogether. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Why are so many flights being cancelled? Travel industry plea for overseas workers rejected Airlines are being blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage with lower post-Covid staffing levels.

Andrew Crawley, chief commercial officer at American Express Global Business Travel, told the BBC's Today programme said it would be ""sensible"" for the government to temporarily change immigration rules to allow airlines to recruit overseas workers to plug staff shortages. ""Some airlines relied on EU citizens for up to 30% of their workforce, pre-Brexit, so that labour pool no longer being available adds to the challenge that we have here,"" he said. However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has rejected such a request from the aviation industry. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled over the past week. While some families never reached their destination or arrived late, others are now finding their return flights are not operating. It is not just exam students - younger children are missing the start of the new half-term too. ""The curriculum is packed and losing three days from school post-Covid isn't good,"" said father-of-four Joe Murray from Milton Keynes. ""There isn't time to really catch up."" The family had booked return flights from Tenerife to be back in time for the Jubilee celebrations but missed the whole four-day weekend after Wizz Air cancelled their return twice. Joe Murray's daughters will miss three days of school ""Wizz Air have had since last Wednesday to get us home, have cancelled once whilst we had checked in and were waiting at the gate, and the other four hours before the flight,"" Mr Murray said. ""It's not good enough,"" he added. Holiday-makers who spoke to the BBC said they were shocked at the lack of communication from the airlines. EasyJet apologised for the disruption, saying it was doing everything it could to support passengers. It has extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and said it was helping those affected find hotel accommodation. Wizz Air also apologised and said passengers would be offered alternative flights, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week. But the ongoing upheaval will affect children who have not even left home, with some school staff also stranded and unable to get back in time. Kelly and her husband are making their way as fast as they can from Montenegro back to Lincolnshire. After their flight home was cancelled on Sunday, EasyJet offered them an alternative flight on Thursday. ""We are both teachers so have to get back,"" says Kelly. So instead they took a bus to Dubrovnik, Croatia, where they waited for more than four hours in the bus station for EasyJet to confirm their accommodation. They will take a four-hour bus trip to Split on Monday so they can fly from there to Bristol on Tuesday. They will then get a train from Bristol to Gatwick to pick up their car and with a bit of luck be back in the classroom by Wednesday. Kelly and her husband are taking buses to Dubrovnik then Split to get home two days earlier ""We do feel really let down by EasyJet,"" said Kelly. ""We wanted to get back to work as soon as we possibly could and they didn't help with that at all."" Pol, who teaches in a special educational needs school in west London has had a similar experience trying to get home from Bodrum, Turkey. The students at his school find changes to their teaching schedule particularly upsetting, he said. So he does not want want to be away longer than he can avoid. ""People from home think a couple more days in the sun, it can't be that bad being in the Mediterranean by the sea, but the point is we're all uptight and upset and to a certain degree disgusted that in the 21st century we're dealing with a company that prides itself on being digital but there's no information."" EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations.

"People hoping to find a property to rent are going to ever greater lengths to secure a home. As well as having to put up more cash in advance, they're offering landlords CVs for their children and photos of their well-behaved dogs. That's because a shortage of available homes is pushing up monthly rents, deposits and leading to bidding wars. Industry body Propertymark says the number of rentals on the books of lettings agencies has fallen sharply. Propertymark surveyed over 440 letting agency businesses, spread across 4,000 branches UK-wide and found that on average, letting agents have seen the number of available rentals on their books halve, from over 30 to just 15. One is agent Adam Kingswood, who says he's never known the market behave like this in two decades in the business. ""We will list a property and stop taking viewings after just a few hours,"" he says. He lets properties in The Park area of Nottingham, where the wide leafy streets and Victorian houses make it one of the city's most popular property spots. ""Out of those who turn up, the majority will want the property and in most cases the landlord has a choice of what tenant they want to go with,"" he says. Adam Kingswood says pets and kids are seen as a 'downside' This leads to a sort of rental beauty pageant, with desperate renters vying to be chosen by landlords. Noisy pets and children can be seen as a downside, so some parents and owners are seeking to prove they're desirable tenants by providing photos or family bios. But it's money that does most of the talking. ""Two years ago, I could count on one hand the amount of times a tenant would offer above the asking price for rent,"" says Mr Kingswood. Now people regularly offer three or even six months rent in advance or an extra Â£50 extra a month above the asking price, he said. Last month, the annual rental survey from website Rightmove found that asking rents are already at their highest ever level, and up 11% year-on-year to Â£1088 per month outside the capital. The rocketing prices are making sitting tenants anxious. Teacher Sheree Osborne moved from London to Nottingham, to save money. She loves her new flat in a converted Art Deco hotel, but she's worried that when her lease is renewed in September, she'll end up in a bidding war. Sheree Osborne is worried rising rents will push her out of her home ""I'm in a vulnerable position,"" she said. ""I don't want my landlord saying I have to move out because he wants to put the rent up Â£200. There are people willing to pay that."" Propertymark says that landlords are selling up, unhappy with increased costs and red tape. Others are switching from renting to offering holiday lets. Lou Valdini for example, had a flat in London and two more in South Yorkshire which he rented out. He's now letting them all go. ""I feel disillusioned by the sector, it was something I enjoyed and wanted to keep doing,"" he says. But during the pandemic one tenant stopped paying rent for sixteen months at the same time as behaving poorly towards fellow residents in the block. ""All that time I was paying the costs and mortgage, as well as getting complaints,"" Mr Valdini explains. It cost him around Â£20,000, he says. ""The stress was huge. And I'm not a professional big company with people working for me to sort these things. It all fell on my shoulders."" Mick Roberts is another local landlord with more than thirty properties across Nottingham. His tenants are all on housing benefits, mostly families but many pensioners. Mr Roberts says he has ""a conscience"" about keeping rent down for his tenants. He has tenants so terrified their rent will go up they are too scared to ask for repairs, he says. Parents are sleeping on the sofa of one-bed apartments with three children in the bed because they can't find nor afford a bigger house to rent, he adds. Landlord Mick Roberts says tenants fear asking for repairs But while Mr Roberts is reluctant to raise rents for those already in his houses, he admits that he asks for the market rate from any new tenant. ""I've got no loyalty to that person,"" he says. ""As time goes on, we'll build up a rapport but for now it's supply and demand."" ""There's been something like 179 new rules in the last five years,"" he says. Which means costs are rising. ""You used to be able, rightly or wrongly, to give the tenants the keys and service the boiler once a year. Now we are part landlord, part policemen, counsellor, we do debt work like a bailiff."" Changes to taxation have made letting properties less profitable at the same time as legislation regarding maintenance and energy compliance has pushed up landlords' costs. The temporary ban on evictions during the pandemic left many landlords out of pocket, meaning an anticipated ban on ""Section 21"", which allows them to evict tenants easily, is causing concern they'll be left with limited power to protect their properties. It may result in fewer landlords and more people homeless, Mr Roberts predicts. The Department for Levelling-Up, Communities and Housing said ""good landlords"" had nothing to fear from the reforms, which were designed to ""give tenants greater security to challenge unreasonable rent rises and poor practice"". ""We're supporting vulnerable renters to help them meet the rising cost of living and stay in their homes, as well as investing Â£11.5bn to build more of the affordable, quality homes this country needs - including tens of thousands for social rent,"" the spokesperson added.
