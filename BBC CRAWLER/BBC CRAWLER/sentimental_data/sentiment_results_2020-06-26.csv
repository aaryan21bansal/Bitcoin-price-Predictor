"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing The mother of two sisters murdered in a park said her grief had ""been taken to another place"" after two officers were suspended amid allegations they took selfies next to their bodies. Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were stabbed to death at a park in Wembley earlier this month. Mina Smallman has complained about the Met's initial response - saying she had to organise a search for her daughters. No-one has been charged with the murders. Speaking to the BBC, Mrs Smallman, the former Archdeacon of Southend, said the pictures ""dehumanised"" her children. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""Those police officers dehumanised our children"" ""They were nothing to them and what's worse, they sent them on to members of the public,"" she said. Senior officers from the Met and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) personally visited the family to explain what had happened after they were made aware of the alleged photographs. Mrs Smallman said she was told the photos showed the girls' faces and she fears the images will appear on the internet. ""This has taken our grief to another place,"" she said. ""If ever we needed an example of how toxic it has become, those police officers felt so safe, so untouchable, that they felt they could take photographs of dead black girls and send them on. ""It speaks volumes of the ethos that runs through the Metropolitan Police."" Nicole Smallman's body was found by her boyfriend after she was reported missing The IOPC said the pictures were allegedly ""shared with a small number of others"", adding the Met was ""handling matters involving those members of the public who may have received those images"". Yesterday evening, the Met said two officers hadbeen arrested on suspicion of misconductin public office and suspended from duty. Met CommissionerCressida Dick said she was ""disgusted"" with the allegationsagainst the officers. Mrs Smallman said she had coordinated a search operation on weekend her daughters died and it was Nicole's boyfriend, Adam, who found the sisters' bodies and the murder weapon. She says the police were ""making assumptions"" when they didn't immediately respond when the sisters were first reported missing. ""I knew instantly why they didn't care. They didn't care because they looked at my daughter's address and thought they knew who she was. ""A black woman who lives on a council estate."" Images recovered from their phones - which were found in a pond - showed the sisters dancing with fairy lights hours before they were killed Ms Smallman, 27, had been with friends celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday at the park on the evening of 5 June. Detectives believe they were killed by a stranger who repeatedly stabbed them in the early hours of 6 June - their bodies were not found until the following day. PCs suspended over photos of double murder scene Met Police chief 'disgusted' at murder photo share Forensic officers have since been searching a large area of the park including a pond and have trawled through hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish that was accidently cleared from the scene. Detectives believe the killer received injuries in the attack ""which caused significant bleeding"". The IOPC is also separately investigating how the Met handled calls from worried family and friends of the sisters after they went missing.

"Facebook has said it will start to label potentially harmful posts that it leaves up because of their news value. The more hands-on approach comes as the social media firm is under pressure to improve how it moderates the content on its platform, including posts by US President Donald Trump. More than 90 advertisers have joined a boycott of the site. Consumer goods giant Unilever on Friday added its name to the list, citing a ""polarized election period"" in the US. The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said it would halt Twitter, Facebook and Instagram advertising in the US ""at least"" through 2020. ""Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,"" it said. ""We will revisit our current position if necessary."" Ben & Jerry's joins Facebook ad boycott US phone giant Verizon joins Facebook ad boycott In a speech on Friday, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defended the firm's record of taking down hate speech. He pointed to aEuropean Commission report,externalthis month that found Facebook removed 86% of hate speech last year, up from 82.6%. But he said the firm was tightening its policies to ""address the reality of the challenges our country is facing and how they're showing up across our community"". He said the firm would ban ads that describe different groups, based on descriptors such as race or immigration status, as a threat. It will also remove content - even from a politician - if it determines that it incites violence or suppresses voting. Mr Zuckerberg also said the firm will attach a label to ""problematic"" content that falls outside of those categories. ""A handful of times a year, we leave up content that would otherwise violate our policies if the public interest value outweighs the risk of harm,"" he said. ""Often, seeing speech from politicians is in the public interest, and in the same way that news outlets will report what a politician says, we think people should generally be able to see it for themselves on our platforms. ""We will soon start labelling some of the content we leave up because it is deemed newsworthy, so people can know when this is the case,"" he said. Unilever is behind some of Britain's best-known brands Twitter has already taken some similar steps, including banning advertisements from politicians and adding labels and warnings to some kinds of content,including tweets by Mr Trump. ""We have developed policies and platform capabilities designed to protect and serve the public conversation, and as always, are committed to amplifying voices from under-represented communities and marginalized groups,"" said Twitter executive Sarah Personette. Shares of Facebook and Twitter both fell more than 7% on Friday. Some boycott organisers said Mr Zuckerberg's promises did not go far enough. ""What we've seen in today's address from Mark Zuckerberg is a failure to wrestle with the harms [Facebook] has caused on our democracy & civil rights"" said Color of Change president Rashad Robinson said. ""If this is the response he's giving to major advertisers withdrawing millions of dollars from the company, we can't trust his leadership,"" he wrote on Twitter. The ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign was started by US civil rights groups after the death of George Floyd in May while in police custody. It has focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram; and WhatsApp and last year attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56.7bn). The organisers, which include Color of Change and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  have said Facebook allows ""racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"". More than 90 companies including Verizon and Patagonia have joined the campaign, according to a list by ad activism group Sleeping Giants, one of the organisers. This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg told the BBC's Simon Jack that Facebook would 'take down' coronavirus misinformation Nicole Perrin, analyst at eMarketer, said it will be difficult to determine the financial impact of the boycott on Facebook, given the significant changes in advertising amid the pandemic. But she said Unilever's announcement was significant, noting that the firm was dropping the ads for longer than called for, and on more platforms. ""That suggests a deeper problem with user-generated content platforms, as divisiveness is to be expected on any such platform that allows political expression,"" she said.

"The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has called in administrators. The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said earlier it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres will stay open under administrators KPMG. The company said shares listed on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges had been suspended. The significance of Intu's collapse ""cannot be understated,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. Intu collapse: What went wrong for the retail giant? The coronavirus lockdown is speeding up a trend towards buying more consumer goods online, he said. He estimates 50% of workers normally can't receive parcels at work. But with many people spending most of their time at home, and car journeys to shopping centres discouraged, many of those people are now ordering via websites. How landlords should react is a difficult question and there won't be a simple solution that will work for every mall, he says. Shoppers in Nottingham said they hope the shops will remain open Particularly hard-hit will be shops at large office developments like Canary Wharf if more people are working from home. ""It's going to be a really, really tough challenge. There's no getting away from the fact we have too much retail space."" While more retailers and shopping centres are likely to close, landlords can offer shorter, flexible leases, he said, to attract retailers with new ideas. The firm said it had appointed three administrators at the KPMG accountancy firm and that ""the appointment is expected to become effective shortly"". The company was one of the UK's biggest shopping centre groups, with 17 centres in the UK. In Nottingham, where it owns the Victoria Centre, shoppers said they hoped stores would remain open. One worker at the local Boots, who didn't give her name, said she didn't know yet whether her shop will be affected. ""I think we'll all be worried,"" she told the BBC. Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak with about Â£4.6bn worth of debt. Intu owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester Intu has a hugely complicated corporate structure. Although the company's gone into administration, its shopping centres haven't. They are separate companies owned by a myriad of banks and lenders. And they've now got the keys. Shoppers aren't likely to notice any real difference in the short term. But buyers will be sought. The jewel in the crown is Manchester's Trafford Centre, followed by Lakeside. But Intu's less-popular malls will prove more difficult to sell, especially given the turmoil in retail right now. Intu is a property business which basically put all its eggs in one basket, buying more malls as shopping habits changed, and it ended up with way too much debt. Coronavirus then compounded its problems. Intu's spectacular collapse also highlights the pressures retail landlords are now under given the big slump  in rental income from their tenants. According to its annual report, published in March, its debts were worth 68% of its assets, a jump from 53% a year earlier. Ittold investors,externalearlier this month that it expected rent collected for 2020 to drop to Â£310m from Â£492m a year earlier. According to Property Week, landlords collected just 18% of commercial rents for the three months to 24 June. As rent payments dried up and property values fell, its prospects declined. The company employs 2,500 people and its wider supply chain supports about 130,000 jobs, which will now be in doubt. Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. Investors in the company's shares will be nursing heavy losses. Its shares traded as cheaply as 1.2 pence each early on Friday, valuing the company at Â£16m. It was worth as much as Â£13bn in 2006. What went wrong for retail giant Intu?

"Justin Bieber has denied the allegations made against him Justin Bieber is suing two women for defamation after they accused him of sexual assault. Last week, two Twitter accounts tweeted claims about incidents alleged to have happened in 2014 and 2015. Bieber denied the claims and vowed to speak to Twitter to urge the social media giant to take legal action. The singer, 26, filed a $20 million (Â£16.2m) lawsuit in Los Angeles on Thursday which describes the allegations as ""fabricated lies"". Justin Bieber denies 2014 sexual assault allegation An account from a woman known only as Danielle claimed she was assaulted by Bieber at a hotel in Austin, Texas on 9 March 2014. She claims that after a surprise performance in front of a crowd at a bar, Bieber invited her and two friends to a Four Seasons hotel. Danielle then claims she was taken to a private room in the hotel and assaulted. Her tweets have been deleted however screenshots have been shared on social media. Responding to the claims, Bieber shared screenshots from articles from the day the alleged assault took place, which show him with his then-girlfriend Selena Gomez. He says they did not stay at the Four Seasons Hotel. Bieber shared a screenshot of a tweet which claimed he was spotted at restaurant inside a Four Seasons Hotel on 10 March, the day after the alleged assault. ""Even though Bieber went to the restaurant, he did NOT stay at the Four Seasons Hotel,""the lawsuit said,external. Another woman who identified herself as Kadi alleged on Twitter that she was sexually assaulted by Bieber in a New York hotel in May 2015. The lawsuit says her accusation is false and that she had fabricated her allegation ""out of her desire for fame and attention"". It claimed that the women were ""trying to capitalize on the climate of fear permeating the entertainment industry, Hollywood and corporate America, whereby it is open season for anyone to make any claim (no matter how vile, unsupported, and provably false) about anyone without consequence"".

"This video can not be played Mass brawl erupts at Ogmore-by-Sea Lockdown restrictions will not be eased if large parties and fights at beaches continue in Wales, the first minister has warned. Videos on social media showed large crowds at Ogmore-by-Sea, Vale of Glamorgan, followed by violent clashes on Thursday evening. Current travel restrictions areset to be lifted on 6 July. But Mark Drakeford said if the behaviour continued he would ""not be able to continue easing restrictions"". Leader of Vale of Glamorgan council Neil Moore called the scenes ""disgraceful"" and said those causing disorder showed a ""complete disregard"" for their own and the community's safety. He added: ""A major clean-up operation is now under way. The car park at Ogmore beach has been closed and will remain so until at least the beginning of next week."" Residents clearing up litter on the beach shared photos of empty cannisters of nitrous oxide Vicky Fry, who lives in Ogmore-by-Sea, said the police response was ""appalling"" and ""very delayed"". ""They should have done a little bit more for the residents and local people,"" she added. Speaking toGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Walesshe said the party went on late into the night after the incident, adding it was not a one-off but an ""ongoing thing"" locals had to deal with. South Wales Police said two men in their 20s had been detained following the fight in Ogmore-by-Sea at about 20:00 BST on Thursday. Det Ch Insp Tom Moore said the scenes at the beach were ""totally unacceptable"" and the force was working to ""identify those who were responsible"". ""We believe that a large number of youths have travelled to the area from various areas of south Wales to become involved in serious, violent disorder,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said the scenes ""threaten the health of people in Wales and undermine the sacrifices the majority of people have made during this ongoing crisis"". Allow Twitter content?

But he said at a press conference that the ""ugly actions"" of a few people should not ""cast a shadow"" over the efforts made by the wider population. South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael described it as a ""contagion of stupidity"" and said people were ""completely ignoring the risk to public health"". Residents also reported crowds of people partying in Barry Island, and beaches in Swansea, with one describing it as a nightly ""Spring Break"" party on beaches near their home. Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport Lee Waters said the scenes were the actions of a ""bunch of drunked-up young people"", but if it kept happening the Welsh Government would have to ""look again at the lockdown rules"". In Wales, it is illegal to gather in large groups and people are advised not to travel outside of their local area because of the coronavirus pandemic. Social distancing measures also remain in place. Beachgoers told to avoid public transport Quarry swimming warning ahead of hot weather Sun-seekers urged to stay away from packed beach But on Thursday police, the council, and the RNLI had to respond after crowds gathered at Ogmore-by-Sea, as temperatures soared across Wales. The force tweeted a plea to parents to ""check where your children are"" on Thursday evening after reports of ""large numbers of young people"" gathering on the coast. The force said it was ""aware of videos circulating on social media"" and inquiries were ongoing. The beach has since been closed by the council Ogmore resident Sue Francombe said the scenes at the beach on Thursday evening were ""absolute carnage"". She added: ""We've been in lockdown for weeks and then I couldn't believe what was happening. ""I've been here for 16 years and we've never had this before. I feel really angry and upset."" Gerald McCarthy, who lives above the beach, said it was ""absolutely horrendous"", with roads and side streets leading to the beach ""utter chaos"". But he said the beach should not be closed as it was used by walkers and families in the daytime. Another resident, who did not want to be named, said it had been ""building for a few days"" with more people heading to the beach, and by Thursday ""a few hundred were drinking"" on the seafront. Porthcawl RNLI confirmed it had attended an incident on Thursday evening and ""assisted 45 people who were trapped at the river mouth by the incoming tide"". Allow Twitter content?

The Welsh Ambulance Service said it had also been called. Former Conservative leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, who is based in the Vale of Glamorgan, tweeted about ""some pretty ugly scenes"" on the beach. Member of the Senedd Carwyn Jones, who represents the nearby Bridgend constituency, said he expected ""beach closures are now needed for a while"" following the incident. South Wales Police said it broke up the crowds at the beach at about 20:00, with the council forced to close the car park. But the police were called again to the beach at 22:50 after some of the earlier group returned. The force said that while witnesses reported someone had been hurt, as of late Thursday evening, no victims had been identified or had come forward. Det Ch Insp Moore said the force would be ""doing everything we can to ensure there is no repeat of this behaviour"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a separate incident, Vale of Glamorgan council enforcement officers said they were faced with ""a number of hostile and aggressive youths"" tombstoning at Rhoose Point on Thursday night. The officers tweeted the ""behaviour was unacceptable"" and it would be taking further action against the youths. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Michael said it was ""disappointing"" scenes of packed beaches in England were now spreading to Wales. He said that the issue was spreading via social media and there was a lot of confused messages on platforms, but not observing social distancing was putting ""everybody at risk"". Responding to questions about why police did not stop people flocking to the beach before the fight, Mr Michael said there was a ""difficult balance"" to keep, but it was ""not something where you could enforce your way out of it"". ""The police will enforce if it is absolutely necessary, but that's the last resort if people don't use common sense,"" he said. ""We need people to use common sense and that has been the characteristic in south Wales throughout the pandemic to date. It seems to becoming a bit apart."" Residents were out cleaning up the beach at Ogmore on Friday morning following the brawl Under current coronavirus guidelines in Wales, people from two different households are able to meet outdoors, but must maintain social distancing. As a guideline, people meeting outside should do so within five miles of their home - there is no restriction on the number of people at any one time, but getting together with members of more than one household at the same time is illegal. On Thursday peoplewere urged not to use public transport to get to beaches, due to the travel restrictions, and to keep trains and buses free for key workers. But on Thursday evening, images appearing to show coaches leaving Barry Island were posted on social media, and people tweeted trains were crowded with people sitting on taped-off seats. Transport for Wales said: ""Yesterday [Thursday] as a result of an influx of non-essential travel to seaside locations we quickly had to arrange additional coaches, the decision to put on this additional transport was to ensure our essential travellers and key workers could still get to their destinations safely. ""We'd like to take this opportunity to remind people that public transport is for essential travel and where there are no other travel alternatives."" The first minister said repeated scenes of people breaching rules could have an impact on the Welsh Government's approach to easing the lockdown.""If we were to see some scenes like that last night, continuing to happen and if they were a more general breakdown of the efforts that we all have made in that would inevitably have an impact on our ability to go on, lifting restrictions,"" he said. Mr Waters said young people had become ""very frustrated"" after being compliant for a long time. ""You see the first bit of hot sun and out come the beers and a couple of idiots ruin it for others,"" he said. ""There are inevitably flare-ups, especially young men who have had too much to drink in hot weather behaving stupidly, but I don't think you can then draw the conclusion that [lockdown] is breaking down across Wales.""

"A spokesman for the UN's chief said the actions of those in the video were ""abhorrent"" The United Nations says it is ""shocked and deeply disturbed"" by footage of an apparent sex act in one of its official cars in Israel. The clip shows a woman in a red dress straddling a man in the back seat of a white 4x4 with UN markings. The video, shared widely on social media, was apparently filmed on a main street by Tel Aviv's seafront. The UN said it was investigating the incident and was close to identifying the individuals seen in the video. Those involved are believed to be staff members of a peacekeeping organisation in Israel, the UN said. Another passenger can be seen slumped in the front, but the driver can't be seen as the car moves away. StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN's Secretary General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, described the behaviour seen in the 18-second video as ""abhorrent"". That kind of behaviour ""goes against everything we stand for and having been working to achieve in terms of fighting misconduct by UN staff"", Mr Dujarric told the BBC on Friday. When asked if the apparent sex act was consensual or involved payment, Mr Dujarric said those questions were part of the ongoing investigation. The UN has strict policies against sexual misconduct by its staff members. Third of UN workers sexually harassed UN peacekeepers sexual abuse cases rise Staff may be disciplined if they are found to be in breach of conduct rules. They may be repatriated or banned from UN peacekeeping operations, but it is the responsibility of their home nation to take further disciplinary or legal action. The UN has long been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct by its peacekeepers and other staff. There have been frequent allegations in recent years. Secretary General Guterres has pledged to take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to sexual misconduct with the UN's ranks. ""We are shocked and deeply disturbed by what is seen on this video,"" Mr Dujarric said. He said an investigation led by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services was ""moving very quickly"". Mr Dujarric said the location of the incident was known and identification of the individuals seen in the video was ""close to being completed"". Based on buildings visible in the video, the footage appears to have been captured on HaYarkon Street, a usually busy area parallel to the promenade. ""We expect the process to be concluded very quickly and intend to promptly take the appropriate action,"" Mr Dujarric said. The UN has been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct in recent years Mr Dujarric said the individuals involved were probably assigned to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO), which has served in the region since 1948. Heather Barr, co-director of Human Rights Watch's women's rights division, said she was ""not surprised"" by the video from Israel. Ms Barr, who worked for the UN in Burundi and Afghanistan, said it was ""good they're investigating it"", but added that the UN ""has a bigger problem than this one video"". ""That problem is about allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse committed by staff members of the UN,"" Ms Barr said. In 2019, there were 175 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against UN staff members,a report said,external. Of those allegations, 16 were substantiated, 15 were unsubstantiated and all others were still being investigated.

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Spain is just one of many European countries to reopen its beaches, with additional safety measures in place Blanket restrictions on non-essential overseas travel will be relaxed in the UK from 6 July, ministers have said. Holidaymakers are expected to be allowed to travel to certain European countries without having to spend 14 days in quarantine when they return. They are thought to include Spain, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Turkey, Germany and Norway - but not Portugal or Sweden. The full list of travel corridors with the UK will be published next week. A government spokesman said the new rules would give people ""the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad"" while also boosting the UK economy - but stressed the relaxation depended on risks staying low. When can I go on holiday in the UK? What it's like to fly in the 'new normal' A traffic light system will be introduced - with countries classified as green, amber and red depending on the prevalence of coronavirus. The UK is likely to discuss arrangements with countries over the coming days. The government said it ""wouldn't hesitate to put on the brakes"" if the situation changes. Ministers in Scotland have said thata decision has not yet been taken to ease restrictions on holiday travel. Although the UK government has powers over border controls, health protection issues on overseas travel must be supported by Scottish government regulations because health is a devolved matter. Travel services have seen a sharp rise in the number of holiday bookings. Andrew Flintham, managing director at TUI UK and Ireland, said the company had seen bookings increase by 50% this week compared to last, with Spain and Greece the most popular destinations. John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel, said phones have been ""ringing off the hook"" with eager customers wanting to make bookings. Maximum service of four departures an hour at peak times will resume from 6 July, he added. Mr Keefe said bookings had been ""growing"" in the past three weeks, but they ""exploded when the news came out last night"". Portugal has seen a rise in the number of new cases in and around Lisbon recently, while Sweden is also unlikely to be on the list because the infection rate there is higher than in the UK. They are both likely to be classified as red. But the government spokesman conceded there would be nothing to stop someone avoiding quarantine by flying into a Spanish airport, driving over the border into Portugal for their holiday and returning by the same route. UK travellers will still have to hand over the address they plan to stay at on their return from abroad, no matter which country they are coming back from. And they will also be legally required to wear face coverings on planes and ferries. Portugal's Secretary of State for Tourism Rita Baptista Marques told BBC Breakfast her country had been named the most secure destination in Europe by the World Tourism and Travel Council and is a ""clean and safe destination"". ""Some countries are in this list and Portugal is fighting for a place,"" Ms Marques said, adding that the situation is ""completely under control"", with significant testing being carried out. The travel sector has gone to war with the government over its blanket quarantine policy. So a more nuanced, risk-based approach will quieten the critics to some extent. But the storm of controversy swirling around this policy won't completely go away. Portugal, which will probably not be on next week's list of exemptions, feels hard done-by. The country is desperate that UK tourists return. And although in public health terms the US is not currently close to being on the list, it does potentially present a tricky diplomatic dynamic, given the normally cosy relationship between Washington and London. And the transatlantic flight market is lucrative too. This announcement is a step in the right direction for UK aviation, but they want testing at airports to also provide another way for passengers to be exempt. So far, in public, the government has said very little about that. Greece's Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis suggested that it could be up to three weeks before the country is happy to open up an air bridge to the UK, as discussions with health experts are continuing. Mr Theoharis told BBC Breakfast: ""As soon as we have more clarity, we'll be able to convey the right dates and the right message so that's why it's not easy for me to pinpoint exact dates."" Spainlifted its state of emergency last Sunday, reopening its borders to visitors from most of Europe and allowing British tourists to enter the country without having to quarantine. Travel industry group ABTA said the travel sector ""eagerly"" anticipates confirmation of the list of countries, which ""should encourage customers to book"". ""The blanket Foreign Office advice against all but essential travel is still a major impediment to travel, however, and we look forward to the government adopting a similar risk-based approach to that advice,"" it said in a statement.

Jonathan Smith, from ABTA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that more travel companies were likely to go bust before a full recovery was felt. He said people should expect holidays to look different - not just at airports and on aircraft, but in terms of social activities, like eating out. The UK introduced rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days on 8 June. It was widely criticised by the travel industry and MPs of all parties.

"US Vice-President Mike Pence is hosting the first coronavirus briefing in nearly two months He says the US ""flattened the curve"" while admitting cases are rising in 16 states Florida sets another new record for daily coronavirus cases, reporting nearly 9,000 new infections Another hard-hit state, Texas, orders bars closed amid a surge in cases UK police and government warn they will clamp down if mass gatherings continue in hot summer weather Intu, company which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and 16 other UK shopping centres, has gone into administration Mexico has now recorded 25,000 deaths and 200,000 cases of the new coronavirus The number of cases worldwide stands at 9.6 million with more than 490,000 deaths - Johns Hopkins We're pausing today's live coverage and will be back again tomorrow morning. Here's a roundup of Friday's biggest coronavirus stories:  Our live coverage was brought to you by our BBC teams in the UK and abroad: Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Alexandra Fouche, Hugo Bachega, Patrick Jackson, Victoria Bisset, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea, Holly Honderich, Sophie Williams, Katie Wright, Alix Kroeger and Rob Corp. We will soon be ending our coronavirus live coverage for today. But before we leave, here's a chance to catch
up on Friday's main developments across the UK:  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington It was a tough week for the White House. The number of cases has shot up in Florida, Texas, Mississippi and other states where governors have tried to reinforce President Trumpâs message that the nationâs returning to normal. The spike in cases has alarmed many people, and Vice President Mike Pence expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Then he tried to put a gloss on the situation. White House officials have much to be proud of, he said, explaining that they have made âremarkable progressâ in moving the country forward: âWe slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.â His self-congratulatory tone was surprising, given the dire news, and his effort to put a positive spin on things seemed jarring. One thing was clear, however: Pence has had a tough job from the start, trying to support the presidentâs controversial positions. Penceâs performance on Friday was an especially difficult â and unconvincing - one. Kate Scotter and Laura DevlinBBC News After the hottest day of the year saw thousands of people descend on beaches around the UK, the BBC went to Great Yarmouth on the east coastto see the scale of the mess left behind. The refuse collector's cart is overflowing. There's the usual drinks cans and plastic bottles, but also a crumpled hat, a paperback book and, balanced on top, a wind break. ""It's as if people have gone slightly mad with lockdown easing,"" says Penny Carpenter, as she helps pick up rubbish along Great Yarmouth beach. With cafes and restaurants only open for takeaways, much of the litter is polystyrene cups and burger cartons, plastic bottles and cans. Rubbish bins have been filling up quicker than they can be emptied. Ms Carpenter said in the 16 years she has lived in the coastal town, she has never seen anything like the amount of litter left in recent days. Joe TidyCyber-security reporter For the last two years, Hadi Damien's big plans for celebrating Pride in Lebanon have been destroyed. In 2018, he was arrested and detained minutes into a recital of a play about homophobia. He was released, but had to cancel the rest of the week-long Pride events he and his team had organised. Then last year, the centrepiece concert of Beirut Pride had to be called off after violent threats were made against the venue and participants. At the start of 2020, Hadi and his team of volunteers were determined not to be put off and had begun to plan some Pride events when, once again, everything was cancelled. This time though Hadi's difficulties were truly global... Read the full story 2 Sisters food factory on Anglesey has suffered an outbreak of coronavirus Meat plants should consider staggered staff starts and gaps between carcasses on production lines to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to new government guidelines for Wales. They have been issued following clusters of cases at Welsh food factories - including 2 Sisters on Anglesey, Rowan Foods in Wrexham and Kepak in Merthyr Tydfil. The guidelines emphasise social distancing and ask staff to work and take breaks in small groups. ""Cohorts"" should be formed, particularly if staff live together and travel to work with each other. It also says staff should not lose pay if they have to self-isolate. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly Â£12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks' work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use. Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned. It follows the failure of the National Health Service app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling - although that was ditched last week as the government madea U-turn. Prof Neil Ferguson's advice led to the UK government's decision to go into lockdown Prof Neil Ferguson, a former UK government adviser whose advice led to the decision to go into lockdown, has said he does not believe a second national lockdown would be necessary. Instead, he said he would expect to see ""targeted"" restrictions to contain outbreaks. He also said the easing of restrictions needed to be monitored ""very closely"". The UK should ""be prepared to row back a bit if we start seeing increases in case numbers,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme. Thenext series of measures to ease the lockdownwill take place in England on 4 July, when the two-metre (6ft) social-distancing rule will be reduced to ""one metre plus"". Prof Ferguson said he ""did not disagree"" with the policy changes announced this week and did not expect to see ""very large growth of cases across the country"" as a result. ""What I do expect to see, depending on how sensible people are, how much they judge the risks themselves and reduce those risks, is clusters of cases,"" he said. But he added he believed there would be ""a bigger potential risk of more widespread community transmission"" as the UK goes into autumn and winter. The White House briefing has come to an end. Here's what we learned: Pence appeared to deny any link between states reopening and the increase in cases in the south. Responding to a reporter's question, he said: ""I think there will be a temptation for people to look at these sunbelt states that have been reopening and putting people back to work, and suggest that reopening has to do with what we're seeing in the last week or so. ""But frankly in the case of each of these states, they reopened - in some cases - almost two months ago. And their test cases, their new cases from testing was low and steady, their positivity rate was low."" Pence blames much of the rise on positive test results from asymptomatic young people. ""We're seeing more and more young people under the age of 35 who are testing positive - in many cases they have no symptoms, but they're coming forward,"" he says, adding that while they may be at lower risk of serious symptoms, they should ""take countermeasures"" and listen to state governors' advice. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, told the White House briefing, ""America has never been readier to combat Covid-19."" In addition to surveillance and testing capabilities, Azar said the country now had ""promising therapeutics that are benefiting tens of thousands of American patients and that have already saved thousands of lives"". He said provision of the most ""promising"" treatments, remdesivir and dexamethasone (the cheap and widely available drug which has shown promising results), had already begun, with 120,000 courses of remdesivir allocated to states and dexamethasone added to guidelines. Convalescent plasma has been used on more than 25,000 patients, Azar said. He added that there were more than 140 clinical trials in the US, with large investments in three vaccines - which have now reached human trials - ""some with the potential to start delivering safe and effective doses before the end of the year"". Rachel SchraerHealth reporter Coronavirus patients in hospital in England are dying at a slower rate now than they were at the peak of the epidemic, analysis suggests. University of Oxford researchers,externalfound the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. Improvements in treatments, changes in the patient population and seasonal effects could all play a role. Around the height of the outbreak, on 8 April, there were 15,468 people in hospital in England with coronavirus, of whom 899 died (6%). By 21 June there were 2,698 hospitalised coronavirus patients, 30 of whom died (1%), according to the most recent data. While the number of people in hospital and the number of hospitalised people dying are both falling, deaths are falling at a faster rate. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is halving every 29 days, while deaths are halving every 16 days. Prof Carl Heneghan, who carried out the analysis, said the pattern of falling death rates in hospitals was also being seen in other countries, including Italy. ""We should be investigating what's changed,"" he said. ""It's a radically different disease we're looking at if the death rate is 1% rather than 6%"". Read more here. Flanked by Dr Birx and Dr Fauci, Vice-President Mike Pence takes questions during the White House task force briefing Responding to questions from reporters, Vice-President Mike Pence defended President Trump's decision to hold two campaign rallies, one of them in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the two US states now leading the country in positive virus tests. ""We have an election coming up this fall,"" Pence says. ""We
still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process."" The vice-president adds that the right to assemble and the right to free speech are enshrined in the US Constitution. ""People are using common sense, they're being responsible,"" he says, insisting that, between states, ""one size doesn't fit all"". The state of emergency was declared on 16 March on the Isle of Man The state of emergency on the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency, has been lifted more than three months after it was first declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The island announced on 17 June that it hadachieved ""local elimination"" of coronavirus. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island was in an ""enviable and rare position"" as life returned to ""relatively normal"". A threat from the virus remained but it was a chance to ""breathe and pause for reflection"", he added. Read more Top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci notes the ""serious problem"" of rising cases in certain areas of the country. Dr Fauci then urges Americans to respect their ""societal responsibility"" to help slow the spread. ""A risk for you is not just isolated to you,"" he says. ""Because if you get infected you are part - innocently or inadvertently - of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic."" ""If we want to end this outbreak, really end itâ¦
weâve got to realise that we are part of this process,"" he says. ""The only way we're going to end it is by ending it together."" Pence has said there is still ""work to do"" and called on younger people to play a role in halting the spread of Covid-19. ""And so we say to every American, particularly those in counties and in states that are being impacted by rising cases, that now is the time for everybody to continue to do their part,"" he said. ""And I think you'll hear from this podium today a particular message for younger Americans across the sunbelt [southern US states] and the role that you can play in protecting the vulnerable."" ""Recognise that this is different than two months ago,"" he said, ""both in our ability to respond and in the nature of those that are being infected and that younger Americans have a particular responsibility to make sure that theyâre not carrying the coronavirus into settings where they would expose the most vulnerable."" White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says officials now have a better understanding of who is at risk of infection and death from Covid-19, namely those over 80 years old and with co-morbidities like diabetes and significant obsesity, as well as how the virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers. âThanks
to the millennials who have been heeding our guidance they have been coming
forward and getting testingâ¦ now we are telling them to get tested,â Dr Birx says. âIt
allows us to find the asymptomatic and mild diseases that we couldnât find
before.â Noting the rising cases in southern states, Birx says the two leading states for positive tests are Texas and Arizona. Vice-President Pence echoed President Donald Trump's message that the number of cases had been increasing because testing had been stepped up. Last weekend, the president told a rally in Oklahoma he had asked his team to reduce testing to keep case numbers down. The White House said at the time that Trump was ""in jest"" but the president said on Tuesday: ""I don't kid."" Pence says that while 34 states ""are experiencing stability"", ""we have seen cases rise precipitously across the south"". He adds that while daily new cases had fallen from around 30,000 in April, the number has now risen again (today,the US reached 40,000 new cases for the first time). He says there are 16 states with rises in cases and the percentage of positive results. Â© 2025 BBC.

We will soon be ending our coronavirus live coverage for today. But before we leave, here's a chance to catch
up on Friday's main developments across the UK:  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington It was a tough week for the White House. The number of cases has shot up in Florida, Texas, Mississippi and other states where governors have tried to reinforce President Trumpâs message that the nationâs returning to normal. The spike in cases has alarmed many people, and Vice President Mike Pence expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Then he tried to put a gloss on the situation. White House officials have much to be proud of, he said, explaining that they have made âremarkable progressâ in moving the country forward: âWe slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.â His self-congratulatory tone was surprising, given the dire news, and his effort to put a positive spin on things seemed jarring. One thing was clear, however: Pence has had a tough job from the start, trying to support the presidentâs controversial positions. Penceâs performance on Friday was an especially difficult â and unconvincing - one. Kate Scotter and Laura DevlinBBC News After the hottest day of the year saw thousands of people descend on beaches around the UK, the BBC went to Great Yarmouth on the east coastto see the scale of the mess left behind. The refuse collector's cart is overflowing. There's the usual drinks cans and plastic bottles, but also a crumpled hat, a paperback book and, balanced on top, a wind break. ""It's as if people have gone slightly mad with lockdown easing,"" says Penny Carpenter, as she helps pick up rubbish along Great Yarmouth beach. With cafes and restaurants only open for takeaways, much of the litter is polystyrene cups and burger cartons, plastic bottles and cans. Rubbish bins have been filling up quicker than they can be emptied. Ms Carpenter said in the 16 years she has lived in the coastal town, she has never seen anything like the amount of litter left in recent days.

In 2018, he was arrested and detained minutes into a recital of a play about homophobia. He was released, but had to cancel the rest of the week-long Pride events he and his team had organised. Then last year, the centrepiece concert of Beirut Pride had to be called off after violent threats were made against the venue and participants. At the start of 2020, Hadi and his team of volunteers were determined not to be put off and had begun to plan some Pride events when, once again, everything was cancelled.

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly Â£12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks' work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use. Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned. It follows the failure of the National Health Service app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling - although that was ditched last week as the government madea U-turn. Prof Neil Ferguson's advice led to the UK government's decision to go into lockdown Prof Neil Ferguson, a former UK government adviser whose advice led to the decision to go into lockdown, has said he does not believe a second national lockdown would be necessary. Instead, he said he would expect to see ""targeted"" restrictions to contain outbreaks. He also said the easing of restrictions needed to be monitored ""very closely"". The UK should ""be prepared to row back a bit if we start seeing increases in case numbers,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme. Thenext series of measures to ease the lockdownwill take place in England on 4 July, when the two-metre (6ft) social-distancing rule will be reduced to ""one metre plus"". Prof Ferguson said he ""did not disagree"" with the policy changes announced this week and did not expect to see ""very large growth of cases across the country"" as a result. ""What I do expect to see, depending on how sensible people are, how much they judge the risks themselves and reduce those risks, is clusters of cases,"" he said. But he added he believed there would be ""a bigger potential risk of more widespread community transmission"" as the UK goes into autumn and winter. The White House briefing has come to an end. Here's what we learned: Pence appeared to deny any link between states reopening and the increase in cases in the south. Responding to a reporter's question, he said: ""I think there will be a temptation for people to look at these sunbelt states that have been reopening and putting people back to work, and suggest that reopening has to do with what we're seeing in the last week or so.

"Artwork: OneWeb had launched 74 spacecraft before it collapsed The UK government looks set to put money behind a rescue package for the ailing satellite company OneWeb. The London start-up had been trying to build a network of spacecraft to deliver broadband connections but was forced to seek bankruptcy protection in March because of insufficient funds. It's understood Boris Johnson's government could now put about Â£500m into the project, in part because it believes OneWeb can also provide a satellite navigation service. This has become an important issue since the UK lost its membership of the European Galileo sat-nav system after exiting the EU. The OneWeb service would be backup for the US-based Global Positioning System (GPS) in case it is attacked or fails. If GPS were to go down motorists, businesses and the military would be left without a precise navigation signal. Brexit funds released for sat-nav study Galileo sat-nav system still without service Could the world cope if GPS stopped working? The prime minister has agreed to put up taxpayer money for the purchase, as part of a larger private sector consortium bid, the BBC understands. Downing Street declined to comment on the reported negotiations to buy a stake in OneWeb. A Number 10 spokesman said the UK was continuing to develop a sovereign space programme through the national space strategy. ""Work on that is continuing on multiple fronts. This includes developing plans for our own national capabilities in satellite navigation, positioning and timing,"" the spokesman said. ""We continue to work and have regular conversations with the space industry about this."" UK-based OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where half its operations and all of its manufacturing are located, after failing to secure new funding. Before its collapse, OneWeb had launched 74 spacecraft in what was planned to be a broadband internet constellation of 650. The start-up has a goal, though, for thousands more. OneWeb has plans for thousands more satellites As part of any deal, the government would expect the building of future satellites to be brought to the UK. The American bankruptcy court is now running a bidding process for OneWeb's assets, such as the radio frequencies it owns. The Japanese tech investor Softbank and aerospace giant Airbus are among the largest shareholders. They will have to choose whether to go with a UK government-backed rescue package or another offer. Airbus issued a statement on Friday, saying: ""The reported support of the UK government for a bid for OneWeb looks positive to support (the) UK's ambition to continue to be a leading player in space. As an original investor, and the manufacturer, in OneWeb, Airbus is pleased that a way forward looks likely. It added: ""Airbus and the wider UK space ecosystem have the skills to build future capability and then drive export opportunities. We would look forward to supporting OneWeb in the next phase of their business and growing the UK contribution to this market-changing business."" If this comes off, it would be a bold move by the government - a statement that it is prepared to spend big in space. The question remains, though, whether it would be the right move. There is excitement currently about constellations of hundreds - if not thousands - of low-orbiting satellites and how they could be used to deliver broadband internet to places where connections are poor or simply non-existent. But the business case is still on trial. Witness OneWeb's present difficulties; and although rival SpaceX continues to launch more of its Starlink spacecraft month after month, the Californian firm is a long way from earning meaningful revenues. So, there are those in the UK space sector who believe the government will be taking an enormous gamble if it seeks to put a positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) service on the back of OneWeb. After all, this would be critical national infrastructure. What would happen were OneWeb to fail again? A better solution, the doubters argue, would be to use satellites operated by established British telecommunications companies. In the flurry of lobbying that's been going on, the government has been presented with low-cost ideas to use a mix of high and low-orbiting satellites to provide what would, at first, be a regional satellite-navigation service, but one that could eventually be built out into a global system. Previously, the UK aimed to build its own global navigation satellite system, at a cost estimated by independent experts of between Â£3bn and Â£5bn. The EU's Galileo system went live in 2016, as an alternative to using GPS or the Russian GLONASS system. The UK and EU previously argued over the level of access the UK should have to the Galileo satellite-navigation system after Brexit. Then-Prime Minister Theresa May said in December 2018 that the UK expected to work with its Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners - the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - in developing a new system. The Americans are understood to like the OneWeb solution because it provides something very different to the existing architectures for satellite navigation. For the UK, it also presents the possibility of obtaining capability at significantly lower cost than had originally been envisaged for an independent system.

"A spokesman for the UN's chief said the actions of those in the video were ""abhorrent"" The United Nations says it is ""shocked and deeply disturbed"" by footage of an apparent sex act in one of its official cars in Israel. The clip shows a woman in a red dress straddling a man in the back seat of a white 4x4 with UN markings. The video, shared widely on social media, was apparently filmed on a main street by Tel Aviv's seafront. The UN said it was investigating the incident and was close to identifying the individuals seen in the video. Those involved are believed to be staff members of a peacekeeping organisation in Israel, the UN said. Another passenger can be seen slumped in the front, but the driver can't be seen as the car moves away. StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN's Secretary General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, described the behaviour seen in the 18-second video as ""abhorrent"". That kind of behaviour ""goes against everything we stand for and having been working to achieve in terms of fighting misconduct by UN staff"", Mr Dujarric told the BBC on Friday. When asked if the apparent sex act was consensual or involved payment, Mr Dujarric said those questions were part of the ongoing investigation. The UN has strict policies against sexual misconduct by its staff members. Third of UN workers sexually harassed UN peacekeepers sexual abuse cases rise Staff may be disciplined if they are found to be in breach of conduct rules. They may be repatriated or banned from UN peacekeeping operations, but it is the responsibility of their home nation to take further disciplinary or legal action. The UN has long been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct by its peacekeepers and other staff. There have been frequent allegations in recent years. Secretary General Guterres has pledged to take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to sexual misconduct with the UN's ranks. ""We are shocked and deeply disturbed by what is seen on this video,"" Mr Dujarric said. He said an investigation led by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services was ""moving very quickly"". Mr Dujarric said the location of the incident was known and identification of the individuals seen in the video was ""close to being completed"". Based on buildings visible in the video, the footage appears to have been captured on HaYarkon Street, a usually busy area parallel to the promenade. ""We expect the process to be concluded very quickly and intend to promptly take the appropriate action,"" Mr Dujarric said. The UN has been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct in recent years Mr Dujarric said the individuals involved were probably assigned to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO), which has served in the region since 1948. Heather Barr, co-director of Human Rights Watch's women's rights division, said she was ""not surprised"" by the video from Israel. Ms Barr, who worked for the UN in Burundi and Afghanistan, said it was ""good they're investigating it"", but added that the UN ""has a bigger problem than this one video"". ""That problem is about allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse committed by staff members of the UN,"" Ms Barr said. In 2019, there were 175 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against UN staff members,a report said,external. Of those allegations, 16 were substantiated, 15 were unsubstantiated and all others were still being investigated.

"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing The mother of two sisters murdered in a park said her grief had ""been taken to another place"" after two officers were suspended amid allegations they took selfies next to their bodies. Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry were stabbed to death at a park in Wembley earlier this month. Mina Smallman has complained about the Met's initial response - saying she had to organise a search for her daughters. No-one has been charged with the murders. Speaking to the BBC, Mrs Smallman, the former Archdeacon of Southend, said the pictures ""dehumanised"" her children. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""Those police officers dehumanised our children"" ""They were nothing to them and what's worse, they sent them on to members of the public,"" she said. Senior officers from the Met and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) personally visited the family to explain what had happened after they were made aware of the alleged photographs. Mrs Smallman said she was told the photos showed the girls' faces and she fears the images will appear on the internet. ""This has taken our grief to another place,"" she said. ""If ever we needed an example of how toxic it has become, those police officers felt so safe, so untouchable, that they felt they could take photographs of dead black girls and send them on. ""It speaks volumes of the ethos that runs through the Metropolitan Police."" Nicole Smallman's body was found by her boyfriend after she was reported missing The IOPC said the pictures were allegedly ""shared with a small number of others"", adding the Met was ""handling matters involving those members of the public who may have received those images"". Yesterday evening, the Met said two officers hadbeen arrested on suspicion of misconductin public office and suspended from duty. Met CommissionerCressida Dick said she was ""disgusted"" with the allegationsagainst the officers. Mrs Smallman said she had coordinated a search operation on weekend her daughters died and it was Nicole's boyfriend, Adam, who found the sisters' bodies and the murder weapon. She says the police were ""making assumptions"" when they didn't immediately respond when the sisters were first reported missing. ""I knew instantly why they didn't care. They didn't care because they looked at my daughter's address and thought they knew who she was. ""A black woman who lives on a council estate."" Images recovered from their phones - which were found in a pond - showed the sisters dancing with fairy lights hours before they were killed Ms Smallman, 27, had been with friends celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday at the park on the evening of 5 June. Detectives believe they were killed by a stranger who repeatedly stabbed them in the early hours of 6 June - their bodies were not found until the following day. PCs suspended over photos of double murder scene Met Police chief 'disgusted' at murder photo share Forensic officers have since been searching a large area of the park including a pond and have trawled through hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish that was accidently cleared from the scene. Detectives believe the killer received injuries in the attack ""which caused significant bleeding"". The IOPC is also separately investigating how the Met handled calls from worried family and friends of the sisters after they went missing.

"Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow. Six people were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The incident happened in the stairwell of the Park Inn Hotel on West George Street in the centre of Glasgow at about 12:50 The hotel has been housing asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident Ms Sturgeon said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. BBC Scotland News That brings us to the end of BBC Scotland's live coverage of a major incident in Glasgow which left six people with stab wounds. The suspect was shot dead by police officers.  Any further developments will be reported on the BBC News website. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken says ""division is the last thing we need"" The leader of Glasgow City Council was asked about a suggestion that Glasgow was a ""powder keg"" - and that the incident could lead to further disorder in the city. Earlier this month there were violent scenes in the city when far right supporters turned up at a rally in support of refugees. Susan Aitken told Reporting Scotland: ""I would absolutely urge anyone not to politicise this, not to use this to divide the city."" Ms Aitken said Glasgow had faced tragedy in the past - and would come through it by supporting each other and not allowing communities to be divided. ""There has been a lot of speculation this afternoon which hasn't been helpful which doesn't help. It's not fair to the victims, it's not fair to the victims' families and it doesn't help the city,"" she said. ""Glasgow needs to pull together, we need to have each others' backs and support our communities through this. Division is the last thing we need.""  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked the Police Scotland chief constable Iain Livingstone for the exceptional bravery of his officers at today's incident in Glasgow, No 10 Downing Street has revealed. ""The PMâs thoughts remain with the injured and their loved ones,"" it said, pointing out that he had spoken to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Johnson has also held a meeting with
the Home Secretary and senior police officers, in which he was updated. Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says it is
âreassuringâ that the stabbing incident in Glasgow is not being treated as a terrorist incident, but it is still a ""deeply distressing time for everyone involved"". The Park Inn Hotel was being used to house asylum seekers while
their own accommodation was being refurbished. ""Without getting into speculation about any kind of connection, we can say Glasgow is a city with a long and proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers,"" Mr Harvie told BBC News. ""It is also a city where there has been a strong desire to
treat refugees and asylum seekers with decency. That hasnât always been the case in the UK asylum system."" Mr Harvie claimed the way asylum seekers have been treated during the recent coronavirus crisis is ""clearly well short of
adequate"".   Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said that while there is no wider risk to the public, West George Street remains closed as investigations continue and the public should avoid the area. ""As would be the case in any police discharge of firearms
involving a fatality, the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service has instructed the police investigations and review commissioner
to investigate,"" he added. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland ""Don't be alarmist and spread unsubstantiated rumours or claims,"" Labour MSP for Glasgow, Anas Sarwar, has urged the public. He asked them to remember that ""human beings"" were killed and injured at the Glasgow hotel. ""It is really sad and really distressing and I've seen on social media already people trying to dehumanise them and label them as asylum seekers, etc,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But these are, first and foremost, human beings and human beings who are going through horror today. They are fellow Glaswegians who are going through horror today."" Mr Sarwar pointed out that there was a protest last week over ""how asylum seekers have been treated"" saying they were kicked out of their accommodation amidst the coronavirus pandemic. He said: ""They have fled tyranny, violence and danger abroad and sadly they have been amidst violence and danger today."" Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson has just given a brief update near the scene of the stabbings. He said the first report came in at 12:50 and officers were on the scene within two minutes. He confirms that the incident is not being treated as terrorism, and that armed officers shot dead a man. A 42-year-old police officer was wounded and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Five other men are also in hospital, aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland BBC Scotland reporter Gillian Sharpe is outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: ""This is the closest hospital to the scene of this afternoon's incident. Six people are being treated in hospital - here, and at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital across the city. ""One of them is the police officer and their condition is described as critical. Their family has been informed."" Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow Six men were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The ages of the other injured are 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Craig Milroy was working nearby and saw a badly injured man lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""I saw a man with no T-shirt, no shoes lying on the ground with what looked like a stab wound with someone compressing the wound,"" he told the BBC News Channel ""We looked further up and we saw a large police presence. Then we saw the man with the stab wound being taken away in an ambulance being put on oxygen. ""After that the police came over, told us to move into our office and lock the doors. That's when the alarm bells started ringing."" He said he saw up to seven people being taken away in ambulances. ""The man we saw, it looked maybe like he had tried to run away from the hotel. The man we saw outside our office, it looked like maybe he tried to escape any incident that happened but before that it looked like everything was happening within the hotel.""  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Allan Burnett, a policing expert who worked on the  investigation into the Glasgow Airport terror attack in June 2007, told BBC Radio Scotland there would be a huge ongoing operation at the scene. He said: ""The incident is still live so there's a degree of crowd control going on and there will be a massive scene preservation and examination, including speaking to witnesses. ""A senior investigating officer will also be appointed and the firearms team that were involved will be subject to a debrief."" Responding to the news that the stabbings took place at a hotel that was housing asylum seekers, Nicola Sturgeon had this message to ""people across Glasgow and across Scotland"". ""When dreadful things like this happen, they shock all of us to our core but above all they should remind us of what unites us and not what divides us,"" she said. She continued: ""The people of Glasgow are wonderful people, and I'm sure tonight there will be a coming together in the city of Glasgow and all of us, reminding of us what unites us as human beings."" The whole country, the whole world is going through a really tough and traumatic time at the moment and this is an opportunity, a time to think of each other and the care we owe each other. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland The first minister confirms that the injured police officer remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.  The injury of a police officer, of course, reminds us of the bravery of our police service. They run towards dangers as the rest of us would run away. Nicola Sturgeon First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. The police have confirmed that one person has died after being shot by officers. Ms Sturgeon said her thoughts are with the six people injured after being stabbed in the attack, one of them a police officer. She said the attack ""reminds us of the bravery"" of police officers, who in this case ensured that a very serious incident did not become even worse. The first minister said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident - ""but there are still details yet to be determined"". Allow Twitter content?

Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent A well-placed Whitehall source who had previously said that three people had died in Glasgow now says that ONE person is confirmed to have died - the suspected attacker, who was shot by police. Matthew Nisbet, who was working near the scene of the stabbings, said police were there ""within two or three minutes of everything kicking off"". He told the BBC's Connor Gillies he could see a badly-injured man who later died lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""We could see a person with a deep wound and blood all over the steps. I think I heard two shots but I couldn't be certain. We were cleared from the scene pretty quick by the police. They were absolutely incredible, all of them."" He estimated that there were 100-150 police on the scene within five minutes - an ""incredible response"". ""I would say to them thank you, and I would say to them they are brave and they are heroes,"" he said.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme it was a ""tragic thing that has happened in our city"". ""I think all Glaswegians will share that devastation,"" she said. ""Our heart goes out to the victims and their families and the brave police officer who was injured. I am incredibly grateful to our police and emergency services who were on the scene. ""The city is going to have to pull together and support each other to get through this."" She added: ""We don't want Glasgow divided because of this incident. Speculation about motive isn't helpful.""

Here's a roundup of Friday's biggest coronavirus stories:  Our live coverage was brought to you by our BBC teams in the UK and abroad: Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Alexandra Fouche, Hugo Bachega, Patrick Jackson, Victoria Bisset, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea, Holly Honderich, Sophie Williams, Katie Wright, Alix Kroeger and Rob Corp. We will soon be ending our coronavirus live coverage for today. But before we leave, here's a chance to catch
up on Friday's main developments across the UK:  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington It was a tough week for the White House. The number of cases has shot up in Florida, Texas, Mississippi and other states where governors have tried to reinforce President Trumpâs message that the nationâs returning to normal. The spike in cases has alarmed many people, and Vice President Mike Pence expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Then he tried to put a gloss on the situation. White House officials have much to be proud of, he said, explaining that they have made âremarkable progressâ in moving the country forward: âWe slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.â His self-congratulatory tone was surprising, given the dire news, and his effort to put a positive spin on things seemed jarring. One thing was clear, however: Pence has had a tough job from the start, trying to support the presidentâs controversial positions. Penceâs performance on Friday was an especially difficult â and unconvincing - one. Kate Scotter and Laura DevlinBBC News After the hottest day of the year saw thousands of people descend on beaches around the UK, the BBC went to Great Yarmouth on the east coastto see the scale of the mess left behind. The refuse collector's cart is overflowing. There's the usual drinks cans and plastic bottles, but also a crumpled hat, a paperback book and, balanced on top, a wind break. ""It's as if people have gone slightly mad with lockdown easing,"" says Penny Carpenter, as she helps pick up rubbish along Great Yarmouth beach. With cafes and restaurants only open for takeaways, much of the litter is polystyrene cups and burger cartons, plastic bottles and cans. Rubbish bins have been filling up quicker than they can be emptied. Ms Carpenter said in the 16 years she has lived in the coastal town, she has never seen anything like the amount of litter left in recent days.

In 2018, he was arrested and detained minutes into a recital of a play about homophobia. He was released, but had to cancel the rest of the week-long Pride events he and his team had organised. Then last year, the centrepiece concert of Beirut Pride had to be called off after violent threats were made against the venue and participants. At the start of 2020, Hadi and his team of volunteers were determined not to be put off and had begun to plan some Pride events when, once again, everything was cancelled.

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly Â£12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks' work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use. Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned. It follows the failure of the National Health Service app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling - although that was ditched last week as the government madea U-turn. Prof Neil Ferguson's advice led to the UK government's decision to go into lockdown Prof Neil Ferguson, a former UK government adviser whose advice led to the decision to go into lockdown, has said he does not believe a second national lockdown would be necessary. Instead, he said he would expect to see ""targeted"" restrictions to contain outbreaks. He also said the easing of restrictions needed to be monitored ""very closely"". The UK should ""be prepared to row back a bit if we start seeing increases in case numbers,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme. Thenext series of measures to ease the lockdownwill take place in England on 4 July, when the two-metre (6ft) social-distancing rule will be reduced to ""one metre plus"". Prof Ferguson said he ""did not disagree"" with the policy changes announced this week and did not expect to see ""very large growth of cases across the country"" as a result. ""What I do expect to see, depending on how sensible people are, how much they judge the risks themselves and reduce those risks, is clusters of cases,"" he said. But he added he believed there would be ""a bigger potential risk of more widespread community transmission"" as the UK goes into autumn and winter. The White House briefing has come to an end. Here's what we learned: Pence appeared to deny any link between states reopening and the increase in cases in the south. Responding to a reporter's question, he said: ""I think there will be a temptation for people to look at these sunbelt states that have been reopening and putting people back to work, and suggest that reopening has to do with what we're seeing in the last week or so. ""But frankly in the case of each of these states, they reopened - in some cases - almost two months ago. And their test cases, their new cases from testing was low and steady, their positivity rate was low."" Pence blames much of the rise on positive test results from asymptomatic young people. ""We're seeing more and more young people under the age of 35 who are testing positive - in many cases they have no symptoms, but they're coming forward,"" he says, adding that while they may be at lower risk of serious symptoms, they should ""take countermeasures"" and listen to state governors' advice. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, told the White House briefing, ""America has never been readier to combat Covid-19."" In addition to surveillance and testing capabilities, Azar said the country now had ""promising therapeutics that are benefiting tens of thousands of American patients and that have already saved thousands of lives"". He said provision of the most ""promising"" treatments, remdesivir and dexamethasone (the cheap and widely available drug which has shown promising results), had already begun, with 120,000 courses of remdesivir allocated to states and dexamethasone added to guidelines. Convalescent plasma has been used on more than 25,000 patients, Azar said. He added that there were more than 140 clinical trials in the US, with large investments in three vaccines - which have now reached human trials - ""some with the potential to start delivering safe and effective doses before the end of the year"". Rachel SchraerHealth reporter Coronavirus patients in hospital in England are dying at a slower rate now than they were at the peak of the epidemic, analysis suggests. University of Oxford researchers,externalfound the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. Improvements in treatments, changes in the patient population and seasonal effects could all play a role. Around the height of the outbreak, on 8 April, there were 15,468 people in hospital in England with coronavirus, of whom 899 died (6%). By 21 June there were 2,698 hospitalised coronavirus patients, 30 of whom died (1%), according to the most recent data. While the number of people in hospital and the number of hospitalised people dying are both falling, deaths are falling at a faster rate. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is halving every 29 days, while deaths are halving every 16 days. Prof Carl Heneghan, who carried out the analysis, said the pattern of falling death rates in hospitals was also being seen in other countries, including Italy. ""We should be investigating what's changed,"" he said. ""It's a radically different disease we're looking at if the death rate is 1% rather than 6%"". Read more here. Flanked by Dr Birx and Dr Fauci, Vice-President Mike Pence takes questions during the White House task force briefing Responding to questions from reporters, Vice-President Mike Pence defended President Trump's decision to hold two campaign rallies, one of them in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the two US states now leading the country in positive virus tests. ""We have an election coming up this fall,"" Pence says. ""We
still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process."" The vice-president adds that the right to assemble and the right to free speech are enshrined in the US Constitution. ""People are using common sense, they're being responsible,"" he says, insisting that, between states, ""one size doesn't fit all"". The state of emergency was declared on 16 March on the Isle of Man The state of emergency on the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency, has been lifted more than three months after it was first declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The island announced on 17 June that it hadachieved ""local elimination"" of coronavirus. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island was in an ""enviable and rare position"" as life returned to ""relatively normal"". A threat from the virus remained but it was a chance to ""breathe and pause for reflection"", he added. Read more Top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci notes the ""serious problem"" of rising cases in certain areas of the country. Dr Fauci then urges Americans to respect their ""societal responsibility"" to help slow the spread. ""A risk for you is not just isolated to you,"" he says. ""Because if you get infected you are part - innocently or inadvertently - of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic."" ""If we want to end this outbreak, really end itâ¦
weâve got to realise that we are part of this process,"" he says. ""The only way we're going to end it is by ending it together."" Pence has said there is still ""work to do"" and called on younger people to play a role in halting the spread of Covid-19. ""And so we say to every American, particularly those in counties and in states that are being impacted by rising cases, that now is the time for everybody to continue to do their part,"" he said. ""And I think you'll hear from this podium today a particular message for younger Americans across the sunbelt [southern US states] and the role that you can play in protecting the vulnerable."" ""Recognise that this is different than two months ago,"" he said, ""both in our ability to respond and in the nature of those that are being infected and that younger Americans have a particular responsibility to make sure that theyâre not carrying the coronavirus into settings where they would expose the most vulnerable."" White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says officials now have a better understanding of who is at risk of infection and death from Covid-19, namely those over 80 years old and with co-morbidities like diabetes and significant obsesity, as well as how the virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers. âThanks
to the millennials who have been heeding our guidance they have been coming
forward and getting testingâ¦ now we are telling them to get tested,â Dr Birx says. âIt
allows us to find the asymptomatic and mild diseases that we couldnât find
before.â Noting the rising cases in southern states, Birx says the two leading states for positive tests are Texas and Arizona. Vice-President Pence echoed President Donald Trump's message that the number of cases had been increasing because testing had been stepped up. Last weekend, the president told a rally in Oklahoma he had asked his team to reduce testing to keep case numbers down. The White House said at the time that Trump was ""in jest"" but the president said on Tuesday: ""I don't kid."" Pence says that while 34 states ""are experiencing stability"", ""we have seen cases rise precipitously across the south"". He adds that while daily new cases had fallen from around 30,000 in April, the number has now risen again (today,the US reached 40,000 new cases for the first time). He says there are 16 states with rises in cases and the percentage of positive results. Â© 2025 BBC.

White House officials have much to be proud of, he said, explaining that they have made âremarkable progressâ in moving the country forward: âWe slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.â His self-congratulatory tone was surprising, given the dire news, and his effort to put a positive spin on things seemed jarring. One thing was clear, however: Pence has had a tough job from the start, trying to support the presidentâs controversial positions. Penceâs performance on Friday was an especially difficult â and unconvincing - one. Kate Scotter and Laura DevlinBBC News After the hottest day of the year saw thousands of people descend on beaches around the UK, the BBC went to Great Yarmouth on the east coastto see the scale of the mess left behind. The refuse collector's cart is overflowing. There's the usual drinks cans and plastic bottles, but also a crumpled hat, a paperback book and, balanced on top, a wind break. ""It's as if people have gone slightly mad with lockdown easing,"" says Penny Carpenter, as she helps pick up rubbish along Great Yarmouth beach. With cafes and restaurants only open for takeaways, much of the litter is polystyrene cups and burger cartons, plastic bottles and cans. Rubbish bins have been filling up quicker than they can be emptied. Ms Carpenter said in the 16 years she has lived in the coastal town, she has never seen anything like the amount of litter left in recent days. Joe TidyCyber-security reporter For the last two years, Hadi Damien's big plans for celebrating Pride in Lebanon have been destroyed. In 2018, he was arrested and detained minutes into a recital of a play about homophobia. He was released, but had to cancel the rest of the week-long Pride events he and his team had organised. Then last year, the centrepiece concert of Beirut Pride had to be called off after violent threats were made against the venue and participants. At the start of 2020, Hadi and his team of volunteers were determined not to be put off and had begun to plan some Pride events when, once again, everything was cancelled. This time though Hadi's difficulties were truly global... Read the full story 2 Sisters food factory on Anglesey has suffered an outbreak of coronavirus Meat plants should consider staggered staff starts and gaps between carcasses on production lines to prevent the spread of coronavirus, according to new government guidelines for Wales. They have been issued following clusters of cases at Welsh food factories - including 2 Sisters on Anglesey, Rowan Foods in Wrexham and Kepak in Merthyr Tydfil. The guidelines emphasise social distancing and ask staff to work and take breaks in small groups. ""Cohorts"" should be formed, particularly if staff live together and travel to work with each other. It also says staff should not lose pay if they have to self-isolate. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly Â£12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks' work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use. Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned. It follows the failure of the National Health Service app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling - although that was ditched last week as the government madea U-turn. Prof Neil Ferguson's advice led to the UK government's decision to go into lockdown Prof Neil Ferguson, a former UK government adviser whose advice led to the decision to go into lockdown, has said he does not believe a second national lockdown would be necessary. Instead, he said he would expect to see ""targeted"" restrictions to contain outbreaks. He also said the easing of restrictions needed to be monitored ""very closely"". The UK should ""be prepared to row back a bit if we start seeing increases in case numbers,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme. Thenext series of measures to ease the lockdownwill take place in England on 4 July, when the two-metre (6ft) social-distancing rule will be reduced to ""one metre plus"". Prof Ferguson said he ""did not disagree"" with the policy changes announced this week and did not expect to see ""very large growth of cases across the country"" as a result. ""What I do expect to see, depending on how sensible people are, how much they judge the risks themselves and reduce those risks, is clusters of cases,"" he said. But he added he believed there would be ""a bigger potential risk of more widespread community transmission"" as the UK goes into autumn and winter. The White House briefing has come to an end. Here's what we learned: Pence appeared to deny any link between states reopening and the increase in cases in the south. Responding to a reporter's question, he said: ""I think there will be a temptation for people to look at these sunbelt states that have been reopening and putting people back to work, and suggest that reopening has to do with what we're seeing in the last week or so. ""But frankly in the case of each of these states, they reopened - in some cases - almost two months ago. And their test cases, their new cases from testing was low and steady, their positivity rate was low."" Pence blames much of the rise on positive test results from asymptomatic young people. ""We're seeing more and more young people under the age of 35 who are testing positive - in many cases they have no symptoms, but they're coming forward,"" he says, adding that while they may be at lower risk of serious symptoms, they should ""take countermeasures"" and listen to state governors' advice. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, told the White House briefing, ""America has never been readier to combat Covid-19."" In addition to surveillance and testing capabilities, Azar said the country now had ""promising therapeutics that are benefiting tens of thousands of American patients and that have already saved thousands of lives"". He said provision of the most ""promising"" treatments, remdesivir and dexamethasone (the cheap and widely available drug which has shown promising results), had already begun, with 120,000 courses of remdesivir allocated to states and dexamethasone added to guidelines. Convalescent plasma has been used on more than 25,000 patients, Azar said. He added that there were more than 140 clinical trials in the US, with large investments in three vaccines - which have now reached human trials - ""some with the potential to start delivering safe and effective doses before the end of the year"". Rachel SchraerHealth reporter Coronavirus patients in hospital in England are dying at a slower rate now than they were at the peak of the epidemic, analysis suggests. University of Oxford researchers,externalfound the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. Improvements in treatments, changes in the patient population and seasonal effects could all play a role. Around the height of the outbreak, on 8 April, there were 15,468 people in hospital in England with coronavirus, of whom 899 died (6%). By 21 June there were 2,698 hospitalised coronavirus patients, 30 of whom died (1%), according to the most recent data. While the number of people in hospital and the number of hospitalised people dying are both falling, deaths are falling at a faster rate. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is halving every 29 days, while deaths are halving every 16 days. Prof Carl Heneghan, who carried out the analysis, said the pattern of falling death rates in hospitals was also being seen in other countries, including Italy. ""We should be investigating what's changed,"" he said. ""It's a radically different disease we're looking at if the death rate is 1% rather than 6%"". Read more here. Flanked by Dr Birx and Dr Fauci, Vice-President Mike Pence takes questions during the White House task force briefing Responding to questions from reporters, Vice-President Mike Pence defended President Trump's decision to hold two campaign rallies, one of them in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the two US states now leading the country in positive virus tests. ""We have an election coming up this fall,"" Pence says. ""We
still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process."" The vice-president adds that the right to assemble and the right to free speech are enshrined in the US Constitution. ""People are using common sense, they're being responsible,"" he says, insisting that, between states, ""one size doesn't fit all"". The state of emergency was declared on 16 March on the Isle of Man The state of emergency on the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency, has been lifted more than three months after it was first declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The island announced on 17 June that it hadachieved ""local elimination"" of coronavirus. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island was in an ""enviable and rare position"" as life returned to ""relatively normal"". A threat from the virus remained but it was a chance to ""breathe and pause for reflection"", he added. Read more Top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci notes the ""serious problem"" of rising cases in certain areas of the country. Dr Fauci then urges Americans to respect their ""societal responsibility"" to help slow the spread. ""A risk for you is not just isolated to you,"" he says. ""Because if you get infected you are part - innocently or inadvertently - of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic."" ""If we want to end this outbreak, really end itâ¦
weâve got to realise that we are part of this process,"" he says. ""The only way we're going to end it is by ending it together."" Pence has said there is still ""work to do"" and called on younger people to play a role in halting the spread of Covid-19. ""And so we say to every American, particularly those in counties and in states that are being impacted by rising cases, that now is the time for everybody to continue to do their part,"" he said. ""And I think you'll hear from this podium today a particular message for younger Americans across the sunbelt [southern US states] and the role that you can play in protecting the vulnerable."" ""Recognise that this is different than two months ago,"" he said, ""both in our ability to respond and in the nature of those that are being infected and that younger Americans have a particular responsibility to make sure that theyâre not carrying the coronavirus into settings where they would expose the most vulnerable."" White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says officials now have a better understanding of who is at risk of infection and death from Covid-19, namely those over 80 years old and with co-morbidities like diabetes and significant obsesity, as well as how the virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers. âThanks
to the millennials who have been heeding our guidance they have been coming
forward and getting testingâ¦ now we are telling them to get tested,â Dr Birx says. âIt
allows us to find the asymptomatic and mild diseases that we couldnât find
before.â Noting the rising cases in southern states, Birx says the two leading states for positive tests are Texas and Arizona. Vice-President Pence echoed President Donald Trump's message that the number of cases had been increasing because testing had been stepped up. Last weekend, the president told a rally in Oklahoma he had asked his team to reduce testing to keep case numbers down. The White House said at the time that Trump was ""in jest"" but the president said on Tuesday: ""I don't kid."" Pence says that while 34 states ""are experiencing stability"", ""we have seen cases rise precipitously across the south"". He adds that while daily new cases had fallen from around 30,000 in April, the number has now risen again (today,the US reached 40,000 new cases for the first time). He says there are 16 states with rises in cases and the percentage of positive results. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Customers have been flocking to supermarkets for toilet roll amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Victoria Supermarkets in Australia have reintroduced limits on purchasing toilet roll amid a rise in panic-buying. On Friday, Coles imposed a one-pack limit on toilet roll and paper towels nationwide, while Woolworths has a two-pack limit on toilet roll. The rush was triggered by a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state of Victoria. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said there was no reason to panic-buy. Limits were previously imposed in March, when Australian shoppers anticipating a lockdown emptied supermarket shelves. Police were called to one store in Sydney aftercustomers fought over toilet roll.,external Victoria's tally of new Covid-19 cases has been in double digits for over a week.

"Liverpool win first title in 30 years after Manchester City lose to Chelsea Jurgen Klopp says ""History is no burden anymore"" The Reds' 19th top-flight title and their first since 1989-90 Get Involved: How are you feeling today? Elated, stunned, emotional, gutted? #bbcfootball News: FA Cup quarter-final and Premier League news conferences Thomas Mallows, Harry Poole and Callum Matthews Ok that's all from Mikel Arteta and from us. See you later! Last bit from Mikel Arteta as he answers a question on whether Liverpool are an inspiration for what he'd like to achieve. ""Well yes because they were in a very difficult position four years ago and they made a lot of right decisions, some very difficult decisions, some unpopular decisions, but the right decisions for them,"" he said. ""And they've been very consistent with their messages, very clear messages from top to bottom. They have this mentality to go into every game with the same spirit and mentality to win the game."" Mikel Arteta won the FA Cup with Arsenal twice as a player and he says he will use that experience to give his players additional motivation. ""I will try to transmit how beautiful it is,"" he said. ""A lot of the players haven't experienced what Wembley means and I have to try to convince them that it's worth the effort to go again after three days, after the effort they put in at Southampton. ""I am sure they are very willing to do that, the rewards are really really nice and let's try to go again and try."" Mikel Arteta also gives his reaction to Liverpool winning the Premier League. He said: ""Well I think they've come so far as a club, as a team, in the last few seasons. ""I think they've set a very clear club culture that they have been able to transmit to the supporters and generate belief. ""I think they have a very clear philosophy in the way they want to play, the way they approach every single game, and then they also have really good recruitment starting from the staff, the coach and all the players that they've signed specifically for the way they want to play. ""Congratulations to them."" Mikel Arteta also speaks about Matteo Guendouzi, who was dropped for the win at Southampton on Thursday. âWhatever internal issues we have we will deal with privately and I will never make any of that public,"" he said. ""All the players that are here I am counting on them but if they want to
jump on the boat they are more than welcome. Thatâs always been my mindset. I
am here to help all of them improve individually and collectively and that is
my job.â Mikel Arteta, speaking about Sunday's opponents Sheffield United: âTheyâve come so far. ""Theyâve set a clear philosophy, the way they want to play and their recruitment. All the players they sign are specifically for them. âThe FA Cup is a competition that is linked to this football club and the players are excited. Going to Wembley, even if itâs empty is special.â Mikel Arteta has popped up for his news conference, so here's what he has to say. A Liverpool fan is planning to cut his hair for the first time in 17 years after the club secured their long-awaited Premier League title. Uke Krasniqi, a diehard Red from Kosovo who now lives in Vancouver, promised in 2014 that he wouldn't get a haircut until the team finally banished their demons and won the Premier League. He said he had been urged ""many times"" to cut his long, curly hair in between by friends and family but ""remained committed to my promise"". Uke said his wife Diana would be doing the honours when Liverpool eventually receive the trophy. ""Whenever I see Jordan Henderson lifting that trophy I will be cutting my hair,"" he told PA. His hair vow came after Steven Gerrard's infamous slip against Chelsea handed the crown to Manchester City, despite Liverpool having led for much of the season. Phil NevilleEngland Women manager on BBC Match of the Day last night Itâs not an accident this. It has been coming for three or four years. Jurgen Klopp has recruited really well and the team has just got better and better. He didnât add anyone into his squad in the summer but he knew they were hungry. Stephen WarnockEx-Liverpool defender on BBC Radio 5 Live last night You knew it was going to happen it was just a matter of when. It has been inevitable but for them to get over the line I feel sorry for the players that they can't share it with each other. I think of the party the Leicester players had and you want to embrace it with your teammate. When you look back in 20 or 30 years when you meet back up and talk about where you were. I'm really pleased for the manager Jurgen Klopp because he talked the talk when he came in and he has backed it up. There were a few people worried after the Everton game because they didn't click into gear but you see the performance on Wednesday and they meant business. They have dealt with every obstacle in front of them. It's been a phenomenal effort from all involved. Mark LawrensonBBC Football Expert Like Norwich, Sheffield United are another team who do not look like they have got a goal in them at the moment. The Blades are just not playing as well as they were earlier in the season, but maybe the fact they are playing Arsenal might help them out. Arsenal are just a mess at the moment, and this is a situation that has been coming for while. Some people point the blame at former manager Arsene Wenger, but I don't agree with that. Even his worst Gunners team would beat this current Arsenal side, easily. There just seems a total lack of a cohesive plan at the club when it comes to things like scouting, recruitment and contracts, and I feel sorry for current manager Mikel Arteta, because none of it is his fault. Since Wenger has gone, there has been a scattergun approach - and it has not worked. As for this tie, I am going for the Blades to win on penalties, but Arsenal's problems will not be over by a long shot even if they do get through. Lawro's prediction:1-1 AET - Sheff Utd to win on pens Arsenal defender David Luiz will be available for selection for this weekend's FA Cup quarter-final clash with Sheffield United. Luiz has served a two-match ban for his red card in the defeat at Manchester City. The former Chelsea man recently signed a new one-year deal wiith the Gunners. Allow Twitter content?

Waiting for Mikel Arteta to pop up for his news conference. Expect him to talk about Gabriel Martinelli after the forward was ruled out for the remainder of the season. The Brazilian picked up a knee injury on 21 June that required surgery. Stephen WarnockEx-Liverpool defender on BBC Radio 5 Live last night When you think back to the Champions League defeat by Real Madrid the response was incredible, it spurred them on for the next year. It drove Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp on.The run that Manchester City went on last year was phenomenal and the Liverpool players held their hands up and their was an acceptance of that.

"Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow. Six people were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The incident happened in the stairwell of the Park Inn Hotel on West George Street in the centre of Glasgow at about 12:50 The hotel has been housing asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident Ms Sturgeon said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. BBC Scotland News That brings us to the end of BBC Scotland's live coverage of a major incident in Glasgow which left six people with stab wounds. The suspect was shot dead by police officers.  Any further developments will be reported on the BBC News website. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken says ""division is the last thing we need"" The leader of Glasgow City Council was asked about a suggestion that Glasgow was a ""powder keg"" - and that the incident could lead to further disorder in the city. Earlier this month there were violent scenes in the city when far right supporters turned up at a rally in support of refugees. Susan Aitken told Reporting Scotland: ""I would absolutely urge anyone not to politicise this, not to use this to divide the city."" Ms Aitken said Glasgow had faced tragedy in the past - and would come through it by supporting each other and not allowing communities to be divided. ""There has been a lot of speculation this afternoon which hasn't been helpful which doesn't help. It's not fair to the victims, it's not fair to the victims' families and it doesn't help the city,"" she said. ""Glasgow needs to pull together, we need to have each others' backs and support our communities through this. Division is the last thing we need.""  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked the Police Scotland chief constable Iain Livingstone for the exceptional bravery of his officers at today's incident in Glasgow, No 10 Downing Street has revealed. ""The PMâs thoughts remain with the injured and their loved ones,"" it said, pointing out that he had spoken to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Johnson has also held a meeting with
the Home Secretary and senior police officers, in which he was updated. Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says it is
âreassuringâ that the stabbing incident in Glasgow is not being treated as a terrorist incident, but it is still a ""deeply distressing time for everyone involved"". The Park Inn Hotel was being used to house asylum seekers while
their own accommodation was being refurbished. ""Without getting into speculation about any kind of connection, we can say Glasgow is a city with a long and proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers,"" Mr Harvie told BBC News. ""It is also a city where there has been a strong desire to
treat refugees and asylum seekers with decency. That hasnât always been the case in the UK asylum system."" Mr Harvie claimed the way asylum seekers have been treated during the recent coronavirus crisis is ""clearly well short of
adequate"".   Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said that while there is no wider risk to the public, West George Street remains closed as investigations continue and the public should avoid the area. ""As would be the case in any police discharge of firearms
involving a fatality, the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service has instructed the police investigations and review commissioner
to investigate,"" he added. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland ""Don't be alarmist and spread unsubstantiated rumours or claims,"" Labour MSP for Glasgow, Anas Sarwar, has urged the public. He asked them to remember that ""human beings"" were killed and injured at the Glasgow hotel. ""It is really sad and really distressing and I've seen on social media already people trying to dehumanise them and label them as asylum seekers, etc,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But these are, first and foremost, human beings and human beings who are going through horror today. They are fellow Glaswegians who are going through horror today."" Mr Sarwar pointed out that there was a protest last week over ""how asylum seekers have been treated"" saying they were kicked out of their accommodation amidst the coronavirus pandemic. He said: ""They have fled tyranny, violence and danger abroad and sadly they have been amidst violence and danger today."" Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson has just given a brief update near the scene of the stabbings. He said the first report came in at 12:50 and officers were on the scene within two minutes. He confirms that the incident is not being treated as terrorism, and that armed officers shot dead a man. A 42-year-old police officer was wounded and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Five other men are also in hospital, aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland BBC Scotland reporter Gillian Sharpe is outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: ""This is the closest hospital to the scene of this afternoon's incident. Six people are being treated in hospital - here, and at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital across the city. ""One of them is the police officer and their condition is described as critical. Their family has been informed."" Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow Six men were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The ages of the other injured are 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Craig Milroy was working nearby and saw a badly injured man lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""I saw a man with no T-shirt, no shoes lying on the ground with what looked like a stab wound with someone compressing the wound,"" he told the BBC News Channel ""We looked further up and we saw a large police presence. Then we saw the man with the stab wound being taken away in an ambulance being put on oxygen. ""After that the police came over, told us to move into our office and lock the doors. That's when the alarm bells started ringing."" He said he saw up to seven people being taken away in ambulances. ""The man we saw, it looked maybe like he had tried to run away from the hotel. The man we saw outside our office, it looked like maybe he tried to escape any incident that happened but before that it looked like everything was happening within the hotel.""  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Allan Burnett, a policing expert who worked on the  investigation into the Glasgow Airport terror attack in June 2007, told BBC Radio Scotland there would be a huge ongoing operation at the scene. He said: ""The incident is still live so there's a degree of crowd control going on and there will be a massive scene preservation and examination, including speaking to witnesses. ""A senior investigating officer will also be appointed and the firearms team that were involved will be subject to a debrief."" Responding to the news that the stabbings took place at a hotel that was housing asylum seekers, Nicola Sturgeon had this message to ""people across Glasgow and across Scotland"". ""When dreadful things like this happen, they shock all of us to our core but above all they should remind us of what unites us and not what divides us,"" she said. She continued: ""The people of Glasgow are wonderful people, and I'm sure tonight there will be a coming together in the city of Glasgow and all of us, reminding of us what unites us as human beings."" The whole country, the whole world is going through a really tough and traumatic time at the moment and this is an opportunity, a time to think of each other and the care we owe each other. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland The first minister confirms that the injured police officer remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.  The injury of a police officer, of course, reminds us of the bravery of our police service. They run towards dangers as the rest of us would run away. Nicola Sturgeon First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. The police have confirmed that one person has died after being shot by officers. Ms Sturgeon said her thoughts are with the six people injured after being stabbed in the attack, one of them a police officer. She said the attack ""reminds us of the bravery"" of police officers, who in this case ensured that a very serious incident did not become even worse. The first minister said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident - ""but there are still details yet to be determined"". Allow Twitter content?

"US Vice-President Mike Pence is hosting the first coronavirus briefing in nearly two months He says the US ""flattened the curve"" while admitting cases are rising in 16 states Florida sets another new record for daily coronavirus cases, reporting nearly 9,000 new infections Another hard-hit state, Texas, orders bars closed amid a surge in cases UK police and government warn they will clamp down if mass gatherings continue in hot summer weather Intu, company which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and 16 other UK shopping centres, has gone into administration Mexico has now recorded 25,000 deaths and 200,000 cases of the new coronavirus The number of cases worldwide stands at 9.6 million with more than 490,000 deaths - Johns Hopkins We're pausing today's live coverage and will be back again tomorrow morning. Here's a roundup of Friday's biggest coronavirus stories:  Our live coverage was brought to you by our BBC teams in the UK and abroad: Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Alexandra Fouche, Hugo Bachega, Patrick Jackson, Victoria Bisset, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea, Holly Honderich, Sophie Williams, Katie Wright, Alix Kroeger and Rob Corp. We will soon be ending our coronavirus live coverage for today. But before we leave, here's a chance to catch
up on Friday's main developments across the UK:  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington It was a tough week for the White House. The number of cases has shot up in Florida, Texas, Mississippi and other states where governors have tried to reinforce President Trumpâs message that the nationâs returning to normal. The spike in cases has alarmed many people, and Vice President Mike Pence expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Then he tried to put a gloss on the situation. White House officials have much to be proud of, he said, explaining that they have made âremarkable progressâ in moving the country forward: âWe slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.â His self-congratulatory tone was surprising, given the dire news, and his effort to put a positive spin on things seemed jarring. One thing was clear, however: Pence has had a tough job from the start, trying to support the presidentâs controversial positions. Penceâs performance on Friday was an especially difficult â and unconvincing - one. Kate Scotter and Laura DevlinBBC News After the hottest day of the year saw thousands of people descend on beaches around the UK, the BBC went to Great Yarmouth on the east coastto see the scale of the mess left behind. The refuse collector's cart is overflowing. There's the usual drinks cans and plastic bottles, but also a crumpled hat, a paperback book and, balanced on top, a wind break. ""It's as if people have gone slightly mad with lockdown easing,"" says Penny Carpenter, as she helps pick up rubbish along Great Yarmouth beach. With cafes and restaurants only open for takeaways, much of the litter is polystyrene cups and burger cartons, plastic bottles and cans. Rubbish bins have been filling up quicker than they can be emptied. Ms Carpenter said in the 16 years she has lived in the coastal town, she has never seen anything like the amount of litter left in recent days. Joe TidyCyber-security reporter For the last two years, Hadi Damien's big plans for celebrating Pride in Lebanon have been destroyed. In 2018, he was arrested and detained minutes into a recital of a play about homophobia. He was released, but had to cancel the rest of the week-long Pride events he and his team had organised. Then last year, the centrepiece concert of Beirut Pride had to be called off after violent threats were made against the venue and participants. At the start of 2020, Hadi and his team of volunteers were determined not to be put off and had begun to plan some Pride events when, once again, everything was cancelled. This time though Hadi's difficulties were truly global...

They have been issued following clusters of cases at Welsh food factories - including 2 Sisters on Anglesey, Rowan Foods in Wrexham and Kepak in Merthyr Tydfil. The guidelines emphasise social distancing and ask staff to work and take breaks in small groups. ""Cohorts"" should be formed, particularly if staff live together and travel to work with each other. It also says staff should not lose pay if they have to self-isolate. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly Â£12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks' work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use. Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned. It follows the failure of the National Health Service app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling - although that was ditched last week as the government madea U-turn. Prof Neil Ferguson's advice led to the UK government's decision to go into lockdown Prof Neil Ferguson, a former UK government adviser whose advice led to the decision to go into lockdown, has said he does not believe a second national lockdown would be necessary. Instead, he said he would expect to see ""targeted"" restrictions to contain outbreaks. He also said the easing of restrictions needed to be monitored ""very closely"". The UK should ""be prepared to row back a bit if we start seeing increases in case numbers,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme. Thenext series of measures to ease the lockdownwill take place in England on 4 July, when the two-metre (6ft) social-distancing rule will be reduced to ""one metre plus"". Prof Ferguson said he ""did not disagree"" with the policy changes announced this week and did not expect to see ""very large growth of cases across the country"" as a result. ""What I do expect to see, depending on how sensible people are, how much they judge the risks themselves and reduce those risks, is clusters of cases,"" he said. But he added he believed there would be ""a bigger potential risk of more widespread community transmission"" as the UK goes into autumn and winter. The White House briefing has come to an end. Here's what we learned: Pence appeared to deny any link between states reopening and the increase in cases in the south. Responding to a reporter's question, he said: ""I think there will be a temptation for people to look at these sunbelt states that have been reopening and putting people back to work, and suggest that reopening has to do with what we're seeing in the last week or so. ""But frankly in the case of each of these states, they reopened - in some cases - almost two months ago. And their test cases, their new cases from testing was low and steady, their positivity rate was low."" Pence blames much of the rise on positive test results from asymptomatic young people. ""We're seeing more and more young people under the age of 35 who are testing positive - in many cases they have no symptoms, but they're coming forward,"" he says, adding that while they may be at lower risk of serious symptoms, they should ""take countermeasures"" and listen to state governors' advice. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, told the White House briefing, ""America has never been readier to combat Covid-19."" In addition to surveillance and testing capabilities, Azar said the country now had ""promising therapeutics that are benefiting tens of thousands of American patients and that have already saved thousands of lives"". He said provision of the most ""promising"" treatments, remdesivir and dexamethasone (the cheap and widely available drug which has shown promising results), had already begun, with 120,000 courses of remdesivir allocated to states and dexamethasone added to guidelines. Convalescent plasma has been used on more than 25,000 patients, Azar said. He added that there were more than 140 clinical trials in the US, with large investments in three vaccines - which have now reached human trials - ""some with the potential to start delivering safe and effective doses before the end of the year"". Rachel SchraerHealth reporter Coronavirus patients in hospital in England are dying at a slower rate now than they were at the peak of the epidemic, analysis suggests. University of Oxford researchers,externalfound the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. Improvements in treatments, changes in the patient population and seasonal effects could all play a role. Around the height of the outbreak, on 8 April, there were 15,468 people in hospital in England with coronavirus, of whom 899 died (6%). By 21 June there were 2,698 hospitalised coronavirus patients, 30 of whom died (1%), according to the most recent data. While the number of people in hospital and the number of hospitalised people dying are both falling, deaths are falling at a faster rate. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is halving every 29 days, while deaths are halving every 16 days. Prof Carl Heneghan, who carried out the analysis, said the pattern of falling death rates in hospitals was also being seen in other countries, including Italy. ""We should be investigating what's changed,"" he said. ""It's a radically different disease we're looking at if the death rate is 1% rather than 6%"". Read more here. Flanked by Dr Birx and Dr Fauci, Vice-President Mike Pence takes questions during the White House task force briefing Responding to questions from reporters, Vice-President Mike Pence defended President Trump's decision to hold two campaign rallies, one of them in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the two US states now leading the country in positive virus tests. ""We have an election coming up this fall,"" Pence says. ""We
still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process."" The vice-president adds that the right to assemble and the right to free speech are enshrined in the US Constitution. ""People are using common sense, they're being responsible,"" he says, insisting that, between states, ""one size doesn't fit all"". The state of emergency was declared on 16 March on the Isle of Man The state of emergency on the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency, has been lifted more than three months after it was first declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The island announced on 17 June that it hadachieved ""local elimination"" of coronavirus. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island was in an ""enviable and rare position"" as life returned to ""relatively normal"". A threat from the virus remained but it was a chance to ""breathe and pause for reflection"", he added. Read more Top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci notes the ""serious problem"" of rising cases in certain areas of the country. Dr Fauci then urges Americans to respect their ""societal responsibility"" to help slow the spread. ""A risk for you is not just isolated to you,"" he says. ""Because if you get infected you are part - innocently or inadvertently - of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic."" ""If we want to end this outbreak, really end itâ¦
weâve got to realise that we are part of this process,"" he says. ""The only way we're going to end it is by ending it together."" Pence has said there is still ""work to do"" and called on younger people to play a role in halting the spread of Covid-19. ""And so we say to every American, particularly those in counties and in states that are being impacted by rising cases, that now is the time for everybody to continue to do their part,"" he said. ""And I think you'll hear from this podium today a particular message for younger Americans across the sunbelt [southern US states] and the role that you can play in protecting the vulnerable."" ""Recognise that this is different than two months ago,"" he said, ""both in our ability to respond and in the nature of those that are being infected and that younger Americans have a particular responsibility to make sure that theyâre not carrying the coronavirus into settings where they would expose the most vulnerable."" White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says officials now have a better understanding of who is at risk of infection and death from Covid-19, namely those over 80 years old and with co-morbidities like diabetes and significant obsesity, as well as how the virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers. âThanks
to the millennials who have been heeding our guidance they have been coming
forward and getting testingâ¦ now we are telling them to get tested,â Dr Birx says. âIt
allows us to find the asymptomatic and mild diseases that we couldnât find
before.â Noting the rising cases in southern states, Birx says the two leading states for positive tests are Texas and Arizona. Vice-President Pence echoed President Donald Trump's message that the number of cases had been increasing because testing had been stepped up. Last weekend, the president told a rally in Oklahoma he had asked his team to reduce testing to keep case numbers down. The White House said at the time that Trump was ""in jest"" but the president said on Tuesday: ""I don't kid."" Pence says that while 34 states ""are experiencing stability"", ""we have seen cases rise precipitously across the south"". He adds that while daily new cases had fallen from around 30,000 in April, the number has now risen again (today,the US reached 40,000 new cases for the first time). He says there are 16 states with rises in cases and the percentage of positive results. Â© 2025 BBC.

He told the BBC's Connor Gillies he could see a badly-injured man who later died lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""We could see a person with a deep wound and blood all over the steps. I think I heard two shots but I couldn't be certain. We were cleared from the scene pretty quick by the police. They were absolutely incredible, all of them."" He estimated that there were 100-150 police on the scene within five minutes - an ""incredible response"". ""I would say to them thank you, and I would say to them they are brave and they are heroes,"" he said.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme it was a ""tragic thing that has happened in our city"". ""I think all Glaswegians will share that devastation,"" she said. ""Our heart goes out to the victims and their families and the brave police officer who was injured. I am incredibly grateful to our police and emergency services who were on the scene. ""The city is going to have to pull together and support each other to get through this.""

"A man has been shot dead by police after a stabbing attack at a hotel in Glasgow city centre. Six people are being treated in hospital for their injuries, including a 42-year-old police officer who was said to be ""critical but stable"". Sources had suggested two other people died at the hotel, which is currently housing asylum seekers. In fact it appears only the suspect was killed. Police said the incident was not being treated as terrorism. The other injured men in hospital are aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. A police spokesman said the situation was ""contained"" and there was no danger to the general public. He added that they were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident, which was first reported at 12:50. He added that officers were on the scene within two minutes of the incident. Live coverage: Major incident shuts down Glasgow city centre Glasgow stabbings: What we know so far One witness, who gave his name as John, said he came down from the third floor of the hotel to see the reception covered in blood. He said he initially saw one person who had been stabbed. ""I went down to the entrance and shouted at him and told him to stay calm and I will call for help,"" he said. He then saw another man, who was ""fighting for his life"".

They run towards dangers as the rest of us would run away."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible incident in Glasgow"". Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson urged people to avoid the area. He said: ""Officers were on the scene within two minutes, and armed officers shortly afterwards, and the incident was quickly contained."" The assistant chief constable added: ""The individual who was shot by armed police has died. ""Six other people are in hospital for treatment to their injuries including a police officer, who is in a critical but stable condition. ""Our thoughts are with the families of those who were injured, including our officer. ""The incident is not being treated as a terrorism and our investigation is continuing into the circumstances."" Another witness, Craig Milroy, saw the aftermath of the incident from an office building nearby and said he had seen four people taken away in ambulances. He said: ""I saw a man lying on the ground, of African descent, with no shoes on.

"The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has called in administrators. The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said earlier it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres will stay open under administrators KPMG. The company said shares listed on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges had been suspended. The significance of Intu's collapse ""cannot be understated,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. Intu collapse: What went wrong for the retail giant? The coronavirus lockdown is speeding up a trend towards buying more consumer goods online, he said. He estimates 50% of workers normally can't receive parcels at work. But with many people spending most of their time at home, and car journeys to shopping centres discouraged, many of those people are now ordering via websites. How landlords should react is a difficult question and there won't be a simple solution that will work for every mall, he says. Shoppers in Nottingham said they hope the shops will remain open Particularly hard-hit will be shops at large office developments like Canary Wharf if more people are working from home. ""It's going to be a really, really tough challenge. There's no getting away from the fact we have too much retail space."" While more retailers and shopping centres are likely to close, landlords can offer shorter, flexible leases, he said, to attract retailers with new ideas. The firm said it had appointed three administrators at the KPMG accountancy firm and that ""the appointment is expected to become effective shortly"". The company was one of the UK's biggest shopping centre groups, with 17 centres in the UK. In Nottingham, where it owns the Victoria Centre, shoppers said they hoped stores would remain open. One worker at the local Boots, who didn't give her name, said she didn't know yet whether her shop will be affected. ""I think we'll all be worried,"" she told the BBC. Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak with about Â£4.6bn worth of debt. Intu owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester Intu has a hugely complicated corporate structure. Although the company's gone into administration, its shopping centres haven't. They are separate companies owned by a myriad of banks and lenders. And they've now got the keys. Shoppers aren't likely to notice any real difference in the short term. But buyers will be sought. The jewel in the crown is Manchester's Trafford Centre, followed by Lakeside. But Intu's less-popular malls will prove more difficult to sell, especially given the turmoil in retail right now. Intu is a property business which basically put all its eggs in one basket, buying more malls as shopping habits changed, and it ended up with way too much debt. Coronavirus then compounded its problems. Intu's spectacular collapse also highlights the pressures retail landlords are now under given the big slump  in rental income from their tenants. According to its annual report, published in March, its debts were worth 68% of its assets, a jump from 53% a year earlier. Ittold investors,externalearlier this month that it expected rent collected for 2020 to drop to Â£310m from Â£492m a year earlier. According to Property Week, landlords collected just 18% of commercial rents for the three months to 24 June. As rent payments dried up and property values fell, its prospects declined. The company employs 2,500 people and its wider supply chain supports about 130,000 jobs, which will now be in doubt. Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. Investors in the company's shares will be nursing heavy losses. Its shares traded as cheaply as 1.2 pence each early on Friday, valuing the company at Â£16m. It was worth as much as Â£13bn in 2006. What went wrong for retail giant Intu?

"Artwork: OneWeb had launched 74 spacecraft before it collapsed The UK government looks set to put money behind a rescue package for the ailing satellite company OneWeb. The London start-up had been trying to build a network of spacecraft to deliver broadband connections but was forced to seek bankruptcy protection in March because of insufficient funds. It's understood Boris Johnson's government could now put about Â£500m into the project, in part because it believes OneWeb can also provide a satellite navigation service. This has become an important issue since the UK lost its membership of the European Galileo sat-nav system after exiting the EU. The OneWeb service would be backup for the US-based Global Positioning System (GPS) in case it is attacked or fails. If GPS were to go down motorists, businesses and the military would be left without a precise navigation signal. Brexit funds released for sat-nav study Galileo sat-nav system still without service Could the world cope if GPS stopped working? The prime minister has agreed to put up taxpayer money for the purchase, as part of a larger private sector consortium bid, the BBC understands. Downing Street declined to comment on the reported negotiations to buy a stake in OneWeb. A Number 10 spokesman said the UK was continuing to develop a sovereign space programme through the national space strategy. ""Work on that is continuing on multiple fronts. This includes developing plans for our own national capabilities in satellite navigation, positioning and timing,"" the spokesman said. ""We continue to work and have regular conversations with the space industry about this."" UK-based OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where half its operations and all of its manufacturing are located, after failing to secure new funding. Before its collapse, OneWeb had launched 74 spacecraft in what was planned to be a broadband internet constellation of 650. The start-up has a goal, though, for thousands more. OneWeb has plans for thousands more satellites As part of any deal, the government would expect the building of future satellites to be brought to the UK. The American bankruptcy court is now running a bidding process for OneWeb's assets, such as the radio frequencies it owns. The Japanese tech investor Softbank and aerospace giant Airbus are among the largest shareholders. They will have to choose whether to go with a UK government-backed rescue package or another offer. Airbus issued a statement on Friday, saying: ""The reported support of the UK government for a bid for OneWeb looks positive to support (the) UK's ambition to continue to be a leading player in space. As an original investor, and the manufacturer, in OneWeb, Airbus is pleased that a way forward looks likely. It added: ""Airbus and the wider UK space ecosystem have the skills to build future capability and then drive export opportunities. We would look forward to supporting OneWeb in the next phase of their business and growing the UK contribution to this market-changing business."" If this comes off, it would be a bold move by the government - a statement that it is prepared to spend big in space. The question remains, though, whether it would be the right move. There is excitement currently about constellations of hundreds - if not thousands - of low-orbiting satellites and how they could be used to deliver broadband internet to places where connections are poor or simply non-existent. But the business case is still on trial. Witness OneWeb's present difficulties; and although rival SpaceX continues to launch more of its Starlink spacecraft month after month, the Californian firm is a long way from earning meaningful revenues. So, there are those in the UK space sector who believe the government will be taking an enormous gamble if it seeks to put a positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) service on the back of OneWeb. After all, this would be critical national infrastructure. What would happen were OneWeb to fail again? A better solution, the doubters argue, would be to use satellites operated by established British telecommunications companies. In the flurry of lobbying that's been going on, the government has been presented with low-cost ideas to use a mix of high and low-orbiting satellites to provide what would, at first, be a regional satellite-navigation service, but one that could eventually be built out into a global system. Previously, the UK aimed to build its own global navigation satellite system, at a cost estimated by independent experts of between Â£3bn and Â£5bn. The EU's Galileo system went live in 2016, as an alternative to using GPS or the Russian GLONASS system. The UK and EU previously argued over the level of access the UK should have to the Galileo satellite-navigation system after Brexit. Then-Prime Minister Theresa May said in December 2018 that the UK expected to work with its Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners - the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - in developing a new system. The Americans are understood to like the OneWeb solution because it provides something very different to the existing architectures for satellite navigation. For the UK, it also presents the possibility of obtaining capability at significantly lower cost than had originally been envisaged for an independent system.

"Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow. Six people were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The incident happened in the stairwell of the Park Inn Hotel on West George Street in the centre of Glasgow at about 12:50 The hotel has been housing asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident Ms Sturgeon said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. BBC Scotland News That brings us to the end of BBC Scotland's live coverage of a major incident in Glasgow which left six people with stab wounds. The suspect was shot dead by police officers.  Any further developments will be reported on the BBC News website. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken says ""division is the last thing we need"" The leader of Glasgow City Council was asked about a suggestion that Glasgow was a ""powder keg"" - and that the incident could lead to further disorder in the city. Earlier this month there were violent scenes in the city when far right supporters turned up at a rally in support of refugees. Susan Aitken told Reporting Scotland: ""I would absolutely urge anyone not to politicise this, not to use this to divide the city."" Ms Aitken said Glasgow had faced tragedy in the past - and would come through it by supporting each other and not allowing communities to be divided. ""There has been a lot of speculation this afternoon which hasn't been helpful which doesn't help. It's not fair to the victims, it's not fair to the victims' families and it doesn't help the city,"" she said. ""Glasgow needs to pull together, we need to have each others' backs and support our communities through this. Division is the last thing we need.""  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked the Police Scotland chief constable Iain Livingstone for the exceptional bravery of his officers at today's incident in Glasgow, No 10 Downing Street has revealed. ""The PMâs thoughts remain with the injured and their loved ones,"" it said, pointing out that he had spoken to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Johnson has also held a meeting with
the Home Secretary and senior police officers, in which he was updated. Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says it is
âreassuringâ that the stabbing incident in Glasgow is not being treated as a terrorist incident, but it is still a ""deeply distressing time for everyone involved"". The Park Inn Hotel was being used to house asylum seekers while
their own accommodation was being refurbished. ""Without getting into speculation about any kind of connection, we can say Glasgow is a city with a long and proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers,"" Mr Harvie told BBC News. ""It is also a city where there has been a strong desire to
treat refugees and asylum seekers with decency. That hasnât always been the case in the UK asylum system."" Mr Harvie claimed the way asylum seekers have been treated during the recent coronavirus crisis is ""clearly well short of
adequate"".   Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said that while there is no wider risk to the public, West George Street remains closed as investigations continue and the public should avoid the area. ""As would be the case in any police discharge of firearms
involving a fatality, the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service has instructed the police investigations and review commissioner
to investigate,"" he added. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland ""Don't be alarmist and spread unsubstantiated rumours or claims,"" Labour MSP for Glasgow, Anas Sarwar, has urged the public. He asked them to remember that ""human beings"" were killed and injured at the Glasgow hotel. ""It is really sad and really distressing and I've seen on social media already people trying to dehumanise them and label them as asylum seekers, etc,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But these are, first and foremost, human beings and human beings who are going through horror today. They are fellow Glaswegians who are going through horror today."" Mr Sarwar pointed out that there was a protest last week over ""how asylum seekers have been treated"" saying they were kicked out of their accommodation amidst the coronavirus pandemic. He said: ""They have fled tyranny, violence and danger abroad and sadly they have been amidst violence and danger today."" Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson has just given a brief update near the scene of the stabbings. He said the first report came in at 12:50 and officers were on the scene within two minutes. He confirms that the incident is not being treated as terrorism, and that armed officers shot dead a man. A 42-year-old police officer was wounded and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Five other men are also in hospital, aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland BBC Scotland reporter Gillian Sharpe is outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: ""This is the closest hospital to the scene of this afternoon's incident. Six people are being treated in hospital - here, and at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital across the city. ""One of them is the police officer and their condition is described as critical. Their family has been informed."" Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow Six men were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The ages of the other injured are 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Craig Milroy was working nearby and saw a badly injured man lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""I saw a man with no T-shirt, no shoes lying on the ground with what looked like a stab wound with someone compressing the wound,"" he told the BBC News Channel ""We looked further up and we saw a large police presence. Then we saw the man with the stab wound being taken away in an ambulance being put on oxygen. ""After that the police came over, told us to move into our office and lock the doors. That's when the alarm bells started ringing."" He said he saw up to seven people being taken away in ambulances. ""The man we saw, it looked maybe like he had tried to run away from the hotel. The man we saw outside our office, it looked like maybe he tried to escape any incident that happened but before that it looked like everything was happening within the hotel.""  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Allan Burnett, a policing expert who worked on the  investigation into the Glasgow Airport terror attack in June 2007, told BBC Radio Scotland there would be a huge ongoing operation at the scene. He said: ""The incident is still live so there's a degree of crowd control going on and there will be a massive scene preservation and examination, including speaking to witnesses. ""A senior investigating officer will also be appointed and the firearms team that were involved will be subject to a debrief."" Responding to the news that the stabbings took place at a hotel that was housing asylum seekers, Nicola Sturgeon had this message to ""people across Glasgow and across Scotland"". ""When dreadful things like this happen, they shock all of us to our core but above all they should remind us of what unites us and not what divides us,"" she said. She continued: ""The people of Glasgow are wonderful people, and I'm sure tonight there will be a coming together in the city of Glasgow and all of us, reminding of us what unites us as human beings."" The whole country, the whole world is going through a really tough and traumatic time at the moment and this is an opportunity, a time to think of each other and the care we owe each other. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland The first minister confirms that the injured police officer remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.  The injury of a police officer, of course, reminds us of the bravery of our police service. They run towards dangers as the rest of us would run away. Nicola Sturgeon First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. The police have confirmed that one person has died after being shot by officers. Ms Sturgeon said her thoughts are with the six people injured after being stabbed in the attack, one of them a police officer. She said the attack ""reminds us of the bravery"" of police officers, who in this case ensured that a very serious incident did not become even worse. The first minister said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident - ""but there are still details yet to be determined"". Allow Twitter content?

"The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has warned that it is likely to call in administrators. The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres are expected to stay open if it falls into administration, at least in the short term. Intu has already warnedthat longer term some of its centres may close. The company is the UK's biggest shopping centre group, with 17 centres in the UK and three in Spain. Should Intu fall into administration, the shopping centres are likely to remain open while the administrators decide what course of action they want to take. Options will include trying to sell the centres on to other potential buyers. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said he expected that most of Intu's shopping centres ""will live to fight another day"". ""Possibly not all, but most,"" he said. ""There are some very good and important centres in Intu's portfolio."" One of Intu's shopping centres is in Milton Keynes Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak, and about 132,000 jobs in the company and in its wider supply chain will be in question should the firm fall into administration. Retail expert Kate Hardcastle said one area of concern was Intu's Â£4.5bn debt, given the declining value of its shopping centres. They ""just aren't worth the value they once were"", she told BBC Breakfast. While the coronavirus crisis forced the closure of all non-essential shops, retailers had already been under pressure from a host of factors including changes in shopping habits as people move online. Big shopping centre landlords such as Intu rely on big retailers for their revenues - but in recent years retailers have been asking landlords for rent reductions due to the pressures they are under, Ms Hardcastle said. Mr Hyman said that retailers were already under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic, and had too much floor space. The pandemic had then speeded up a shift to online shopping. ""What would have taken five years to evolve - we're seeing that happen now,"" he said. ""People have been forced to shop online. When the dust settles, some of that spend will come back to physical stores - but not all of it will."" Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. In itsupdate to investors,externalon Friday, Intu said it had failed to reach agreement in discussions with lenders on so-called ""standstill"" terms, under which it would look to defer interest payments on its large and complex debts.

"Trencreek Holiday Park owner Julliette Hautot reports a surge in bookings this week. If you try to call the Trencreek Holiday Park in Newquay, Cornwall this week, you're likely to find the line engaged. The holiday park is one of many UK accommodation providers that have seen a surge in bookings over the past 48 hours, since Boris Johnson gave the go ahead for summer holidays from 4 July onwards. ""Literally, as soon as he announced yes to campsites, the phone has not stopped ringing,"" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. Hotels, bed and breakfasts (B&B), camping grounds and rental owners say they've been inundated with enquiries from holidaymakers hoping to lock in a ""staycation"" for July or August. ""The calls have been bonkers [and] then there's the emails and Facebook Messenger pinging,"" says Ms Hautot. This video can not be played Flying is a very different experience in the age of coronavirus It's been a similar story for Somerset B&B owner Melanie Cable-Alexander. ""We had a phone call within a minute of the Prime Minister's speech"", she says. ""We've had people writing to us, asking what the plan is, but we don't know what the guidelines are and that's all very confusing."" Ms Cable-Alexander plans to limit the number of guests in her B&B Ellesmere House in Castle Cary and leave breakfasts outside room doors, instead of inviting guests to share the meal at a communal table. Shared breakfasts are off the menu at Ellesmere House in Castle Cary, Somerset The government has said B&Bs and campsites can open up from 4 July, as long as shared facilities are kept clean. That news led to campsite booking website coolcamping.com recording one of its largest ever surges in traffic, plus a 750% increase in bookings compared to this time last year. Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: What's the chance of going on holiday? Quarantine rules set by UK to be lifted for many European countries Summer holidays: 'We're not really going anywhere' ""On Tuesday afternoon and evening we had a booking every 30 seconds,"" says the company's founder Jonathan Knight. ""It's a huge relief for campsite operators across the country, who were concerned there might not be any season at all."" To maximise space between holidaymakers, one of their campsites, Wardley Hill in Norfolk, has reduced the number of pitches on offer this year. Socially-distant camping in Norfolk Center Parcs has announced its opening its five villages in England on 13 July, but swimming pools and water parks at the camps will remain closed until at least 27 July. The company also plans to reduce the number of guests at any one time, to help maintain social distancing. After months with hardly any interest, hotel bookings have also shot up this week, with hotel chain Best Western reporting that bookings are up 700% since Monday 22 June. ""It's crazy and exciting,"" spokesperson Andrew Denton tells the BBC. ""On the website itself, traffic is back up above 2019 levels - the world hadn't even heard of the coronavirus then, so it must be pent-up demand. ""There's a buzz in the office, it's just a fantastic feeling after so many dark days."" Industry group UK Hospitality, which represents hotels and other accommodation providers, says its members are reporting a very welcome increase in bookings since the government announced it was easing lockdown restrictions on holiday accommodations. ""This is a good first step in getting the sector back up and running and a welcome indication that consumer confidence is high,"" said chief executive Kate Nicholls. However, the surge in bookings has sparked a wave of scams, according to UK Finance, trade group for the banking industry. The banking industry is warning holidaymakers to beware of fake caravan and villa holiday websites In a report published 19 June, the body highlighted in particular fake caravan and motorhome listings online, as well as criminals impersonating airlines and travel agencies. UK Finance says customers should ask to see caravans and motorhomes over a live video call before booking, since they can't view them in person. The group says customers searching for a UK holiday should pause and think before parting with their money online. ""Always be wary of any requests to pay by bank transfer when buying goods or services online and instead use the secure payment options recommended by reputable websites,"" advises UK Finance's Katy Worobec. UK Finance has also seen fake websites of villas and apartments offering unusually cheap deals. ""If something is advertised at a rock-bottom price, ask yourself why,"" said Ms Worobec. Best Western's Mr Denton said he could sense the excitement in a WhatsApp group for the firm's 300 UK hotel owners. ""It just went crazy. People are saying 'summer's back on',"" he says. Scotland, Northumberland, Yorkshire, Cornwall and Norfolk are the most searched for destinations, according to the company, while searches for city breaks and shopping trips in London and Manchester are down. Luxury hotel and spa provider Harbour Hotels has seen a similar trend. The group, which owns 15 hotels in England, says web traffic over the past few days is up 210% and bookings over the last few days have been particularly strong at coastal locations. Airbnb hosts also report city dwellers are looking for an escape to the outdoors after lockdown. Caroline Howell's cottage in the Cotswolds has been booked by Londoners ""dying to get out"" Caroline Howell, who rents out a cottage in Chedworth in the Cotswolds, has had six enquiries in the past 48 hours, mostly from ""people fatigued with city life and dying to get out"". ""Bookings for the summer were basically non-existent during lockdown, with everybody unsure as to how the situation would unfold,"" she says. ""A lot of my existing bookings were from Americans on a road trip of a lifetime. They have all cancelled. New bookings this week are not from abroad, but quick domestic getaways."" Airbnb owner Hannah Grace Lodge says customers are swapping their holiday abroad for a week on the coast in the UK It's been a similar experience for Hannah Grace Lodge, who runs an Airbnb property in Margate. She had lots of cancellations for her property, not just for dates during lockdown, but also further into the summer, due to the ongoing uncertainty about coronavirus lockdown measures, but now the property is fully booked for the rest of the summer. Hannah says her customers are booking much longer stays, whereas last year the demand was for short breaks: ""Our guests have messaged about how they are swapping their holiday abroad for a week or two on the coast in the UK.""

"Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow. Six people were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The incident happened in the stairwell of the Park Inn Hotel on West George Street in the centre of Glasgow at about 12:50 The hotel has been housing asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident Ms Sturgeon said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. BBC Scotland News That brings us to the end of BBC Scotland's live coverage of a major incident in Glasgow which left six people with stab wounds. The suspect was shot dead by police officers.  Any further developments will be reported on the BBC News website. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken says ""division is the last thing we need"" The leader of Glasgow City Council was asked about a suggestion that Glasgow was a ""powder keg"" - and that the incident could lead to further disorder in the city. Earlier this month there were violent scenes in the city when far right supporters turned up at a rally in support of refugees. Susan Aitken told Reporting Scotland: ""I would absolutely urge anyone not to politicise this, not to use this to divide the city."" Ms Aitken said Glasgow had faced tragedy in the past - and would come through it by supporting each other and not allowing communities to be divided. ""There has been a lot of speculation this afternoon which hasn't been helpful which doesn't help. It's not fair to the victims, it's not fair to the victims' families and it doesn't help the city,"" she said. ""Glasgow needs to pull together, we need to have each others' backs and support our communities through this. Division is the last thing we need.""  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked the Police Scotland chief constable Iain Livingstone for the exceptional bravery of his officers at today's incident in Glasgow, No 10 Downing Street has revealed. ""The PMâs thoughts remain with the injured and their loved ones,"" it said, pointing out that he had spoken to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Johnson has also held a meeting with
the Home Secretary and senior police officers, in which he was updated. Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says it is
âreassuringâ that the stabbing incident in Glasgow is not being treated as a terrorist incident, but it is still a ""deeply distressing time for everyone involved"". The Park Inn Hotel was being used to house asylum seekers while
their own accommodation was being refurbished. ""Without getting into speculation about any kind of connection, we can say Glasgow is a city with a long and proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers,"" Mr Harvie told BBC News. ""It is also a city where there has been a strong desire to
treat refugees and asylum seekers with decency. That hasnât always been the case in the UK asylum system."" Mr Harvie claimed the way asylum seekers have been treated during the recent coronavirus crisis is ""clearly well short of
adequate"".   Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said that while there is no wider risk to the public, West George Street remains closed as investigations continue and the public should avoid the area. ""As would be the case in any police discharge of firearms
involving a fatality, the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service has instructed the police investigations and review commissioner
to investigate,"" he added. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland ""Don't be alarmist and spread unsubstantiated rumours or claims,"" Labour MSP for Glasgow, Anas Sarwar, has urged the public. He asked them to remember that ""human beings"" were killed and injured at the Glasgow hotel. ""It is really sad and really distressing and I've seen on social media already people trying to dehumanise them and label them as asylum seekers, etc,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But these are, first and foremost, human beings and human beings who are going through horror today. They are fellow Glaswegians who are going through horror today."" Mr Sarwar pointed out that there was a protest last week over ""how asylum seekers have been treated"" saying they were kicked out of their accommodation amidst the coronavirus pandemic. He said: ""They have fled tyranny, violence and danger abroad and sadly they have been amidst violence and danger today."" Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson has just given a brief update near the scene of the stabbings. He said the first report came in at 12:50 and officers were on the scene within two minutes. He confirms that the incident is not being treated as terrorism, and that armed officers shot dead a man. A 42-year-old police officer was wounded and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Five other men are also in hospital, aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland BBC Scotland reporter Gillian Sharpe is outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: ""This is the closest hospital to the scene of this afternoon's incident. Six people are being treated in hospital - here, and at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital across the city. ""One of them is the police officer and their condition is described as critical. Their family has been informed."" Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow Six men were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The ages of the other injured are 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Craig Milroy was working nearby and saw a badly injured man lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""I saw a man with no T-shirt, no shoes lying on the ground with what looked like a stab wound with someone compressing the wound,"" he told the BBC News Channel ""We looked further up and we saw a large police presence. Then we saw the man with the stab wound being taken away in an ambulance being put on oxygen. ""After that the police came over, told us to move into our office and lock the doors. That's when the alarm bells started ringing."" He said he saw up to seven people being taken away in ambulances. ""The man we saw, it looked maybe like he had tried to run away from the hotel. The man we saw outside our office, it looked like maybe he tried to escape any incident that happened but before that it looked like everything was happening within the hotel.""  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Allan Burnett, a policing expert who worked on the  investigation into the Glasgow Airport terror attack in June 2007, told BBC Radio Scotland there would be a huge ongoing operation at the scene. He said: ""The incident is still live so there's a degree of crowd control going on and there will be a massive scene preservation and examination, including speaking to witnesses. ""A senior investigating officer will also be appointed and the firearms team that were involved will be subject to a debrief."" Responding to the news that the stabbings took place at a hotel that was housing asylum seekers, Nicola Sturgeon had this message to ""people across Glasgow and across Scotland"". ""When dreadful things like this happen, they shock all of us to our core but above all they should remind us of what unites us and not what divides us,"" she said. She continued: ""The people of Glasgow are wonderful people, and I'm sure tonight there will be a coming together in the city of Glasgow and all of us, reminding of us what unites us as human beings."" The whole country, the whole world is going through a really tough and traumatic time at the moment and this is an opportunity, a time to think of each other and the care we owe each other. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland The first minister confirms that the injured police officer remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.  The injury of a police officer, of course, reminds us of the bravery of our police service. They run towards dangers as the rest of us would run away. Nicola Sturgeon First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. The police have confirmed that one person has died after being shot by officers. Ms Sturgeon said her thoughts are with the six people injured after being stabbed in the attack, one of them a police officer. She said the attack ""reminds us of the bravery"" of police officers, who in this case ensured that a very serious incident did not become even worse. The first minister said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident - ""but there are still details yet to be determined"". Allow Twitter content?

Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent A well-placed Whitehall source who had previously said that three people had died in Glasgow now says that ONE person is confirmed to have died - the suspected attacker, who was shot by police. Matthew Nisbet, who was working near the scene of the stabbings, said police were there ""within two or three minutes of everything kicking off"". He told the BBC's Connor Gillies he could see a badly-injured man who later died lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""We could see a person with a deep wound and blood all over the steps. I think I heard two shots but I couldn't be certain. We were cleared from the scene pretty quick by the police. They were absolutely incredible, all of them."" He estimated that there were 100-150 police on the scene within five minutes - an ""incredible response"". ""I would say to them thank you, and I would say to them they are brave and they are heroes,"" he said.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme it was a ""tragic thing that has happened in our city"". ""I think all Glaswegians will share that devastation,"" she said. ""Our heart goes out to the victims and their families and the brave police officer who was injured. I am incredibly grateful to our police and emergency services who were on the scene. ""The city is going to have to pull together and support each other to get through this."" She added: ""We don't want Glasgow divided because of this incident. Speculation about motive isn't helpful.""

"It may be a year before Darren Hiles can walk again Taxi drivers have been left without ""adequate protection and guidance"" despite many working throughout the lockdown, industry leaders say. Figures show,externalthe profession has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 deaths. Drivers, taxi firms and industry bodies have said national safety guidance is urgently needed. Government advice says drivers can refuse to take passengers who are not wearing face coverings. Many companies now provide masks and hand sanitiser, but some drivers say they have to pay for their own protection at a time when they are struggling financially. Some report being so ""desperate"" they have made DIY protective screens out of cling film. Most taxi and private-hire drivers are male, and a high proportion are from black, Asian and ethnic minority (Bame) backgrounds - two of the groups at high risk from coronavirus. Over the past three months, drivers say their main jobs have been transporting NHS staff, key workers, patients and the vulnerable. Darren Hiles spent weeks being treated in intensive care While most of us stayed at home, private hire driver Darren Hiles spent the start of lockdown working on Merseyside. ""I wasn't given a mask, but everything was a bit unknown at that time,"" he says. ""Me being me, I thought I would be OK."" The 48-year-old was admitted to intensive care on 7 April, where he would spend the next six weeks, including four on a ventilator. His partner Heidi Neilson was warned on several occasions that he could die. ""I couldn't believe what the virus had done to him,"" she says. ""He looked like a corpse. I barely recognised him. ""Our kids wanted to see their dad and I had to wave them away because I didn't want them to see him like that."" Darren is now out of hospital but it may be a year before he can walk again. He is not sure if he will return to his job, but says his fellow drivers deserve better protection. ""I'm convinced I contracted coronavirus through my job. We were in lockdown when I was infected. The only interaction I had I was at home or at work."" Heidi agreed: ""I work in a care home and we are given protective equipment.  What makes me more deserving then a taxi driver who is also doing an important job? ""The supply should be there for any frontline worker. It's not just about the driver, it's about customer safety."" Figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show male taxi cab drivers and chauffeurs had higher rates of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales. Higher than doctors, nurses and care workers. Scientists believe private-hire drivers are particularly at risk - and the longer the journey, the bigger the risk. ""Unlike black cabs, there is no physical barrier separating the driver and the passengers,"" says Dr Joe Grove, a virologist at University College London. ""People are close together and if the windows aren't open, the air can be quite stagnant. ""An infected passenger releases microscopic droplets containing the virus. Even after they've left the car, the virus will remain."" Sociologist Dr Mark Williams from Queen Mary University of London says taxi and private-hire drivers are among the worst hit because they face many risk factors. ""They can't do their job from home, and their job makes it hard to socially distance, but they're also self-employed so need to work."" While drivers can claim the government's self-employment income support scheme, worth 80% of their trading profits, Mr Williams says many are not eligible. James Farrar, from the App Drivers and Couriers Union, said it was ""unforgiveable"" drivers had been working for the last three months without adequate protection and advice. He added: ""The government has given contradictory advice on masks and no regulatory guidance on plastic-screen partitions."" Firms like TC Cars in Birmingham have set up protective screens which the driver has to wipe after every journey Currently, Scotland is the only part of the UK where it is mandatory for passengers to wear face coverings in taxis and private-hire cars. In England, it is mandatory on public transport, and in Wales and Northern Ireland it is recommended. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport in England said passengers needed to ""think of the safety of drivers"" and wear face coverings, even if they were not required to. But Mr Farrar is concerned that the ""burden of refusal"" is on drivers who might face pressure to accept work from their firms. Not all councils allow plastic partitions, and installing them is a cost many drivers say they cannot afford. Matt Young, who co-owns Shrewsbury Taxis, said he had heard ""horror stories"" of drivers making screens out of ""shower curtains and cling film"". He said screens should be properly fitted and meet official criteria. He added: ""We would recommend wearing a face mask. Sit as far away as you can from the driver with the windows open, use hand sanitiser and pay with your [bank or credit] card.""

"HMS Queen Elizabeth (pictured) and sister ship HMS Prince of Wales each cost more than Â£3bn Ambitious plans for the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers - each of which cost more than Â£3bn - will not be met without proper funding, the government spending watchdog has said. The National Audit Office highlighted concerns over missing key elements such as aircraft and support ships. The Ministry of Defence said it expects to meet its target of declaring an ""initial operating capability"" for the carriers by December 2020. But the NAO called the target ""tight"". The UK's giant aircraft carriers New aircraft carrier sails for the first time Aircraft carriers dock together for first time The MoD is yet to commit the funding required for enough Lightning II fighter jets to sustain the carriers over their expected 50-year operating life, the NAO said in its report. It also said the Navy had just one supply ship able to keep the carriers stocked with food and ammunition while on operations. And it further warned the carriers' new Crowsnest airborne radar system - which forms a crucial part of its defences - was running 18 months late, further diminishing its capabilities during its first two years. Aircraft carriers are often seen as a symbol and tool of global reach and military power. But few countries can afford to build and operate them. It's not just the Royal Navy that's staked its future on the two enormous Queen Elizabeth Class Carriers - it's the whole of UK defence. The carriers need a small armada of ships for protection, refuelling and supplies. They need aircraft for logistics, airborne early warning and to carry out strikes. None of this is cheap, but no one at the MoD appears to be entirely sure of the costs overall. Remember the carriers have been built to last 50 years. What is clear is that all the elements of Carrier Strike will take a significant bite out of the defence budget at a time when it's already under strain. Labour MP Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee which follows the work of the NAO, said the Navy was in danger of being left with a ""hollowed-out"" capability unless the issues were addressed. ""The Ministry of Defence has lofty ambitions for the carriers but hasn't put its money where its mouth is,"" Ms Hillier added. ""Worryingly, it still doesn't know the full cost of supporting and operating Carrier Strike."" A MoD spokesman said: ""Carrier Strike is a complex challenge, which relies on a mix of capabilities and platforms. ""We remain committed to investing in this capability, which demonstrates the UK's global role. ""Despite the disruptions of Covid-19, the Carrier Strike group is on track for its first operational deployment.""

"Trencreek Holiday Park owner Julliette Hautot reports a surge in bookings this week. If you try to call the Trencreek Holiday Park in Newquay, Cornwall this week, you're likely to find the line engaged. The holiday park is one of many UK accommodation providers that have seen a surge in bookings over the past 48 hours, since Boris Johnson gave the go ahead for summer holidays from 4 July onwards. ""Literally, as soon as he announced yes to campsites, the phone has not stopped ringing,"" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. Hotels, bed and breakfasts (B&B), camping grounds and rental owners say they've been inundated with enquiries from holidaymakers hoping to lock in a ""staycation"" for July or August. ""The calls have been bonkers [and] then there's the emails and Facebook Messenger pinging,"" says Ms Hautot. This video can not be played Flying is a very different experience in the age of coronavirus It's been a similar story for Somerset B&B owner Melanie Cable-Alexander. ""We had a phone call within a minute of the Prime Minister's speech"", she says. ""We've had people writing to us, asking what the plan is, but we don't know what the guidelines are and that's all very confusing."" Ms Cable-Alexander plans to limit the number of guests in her B&B Ellesmere House in Castle Cary and leave breakfasts outside room doors, instead of inviting guests to share the meal at a communal table. Shared breakfasts are off the menu at Ellesmere House in Castle Cary, Somerset The government has said B&Bs and campsites can open up from 4 July, as long as shared facilities are kept clean. That news led to campsite booking website coolcamping.com recording one of its largest ever surges in traffic, plus a 750% increase in bookings compared to this time last year. Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: What's the chance of going on holiday? Quarantine rules set by UK to be lifted for many European countries Summer holidays: 'We're not really going anywhere' ""On Tuesday afternoon and evening we had a booking every 30 seconds,"" says the company's founder Jonathan Knight. ""It's a huge relief for campsite operators across the country, who were concerned there might not be any season at all."" To maximise space between holidaymakers, one of their campsites, Wardley Hill in Norfolk, has reduced the number of pitches on offer this year. Socially-distant camping in Norfolk Center Parcs has announced its opening its five villages in England on 13 July, but swimming pools and water parks at the camps will remain closed until at least 27 July. The company also plans to reduce the number of guests at any one time, to help maintain social distancing. After months with hardly any interest, hotel bookings have also shot up this week, with hotel chain Best Western reporting that bookings are up 700% since Monday 22 June. ""It's crazy and exciting,"" spokesperson Andrew Denton tells the BBC. ""On the website itself, traffic is back up above 2019 levels - the world hadn't even heard of the coronavirus then, so it must be pent-up demand. ""There's a buzz in the office, it's just a fantastic feeling after so many dark days."" Industry group UK Hospitality, which represents hotels and other accommodation providers, says its members are reporting a very welcome increase in bookings since the government announced it was easing lockdown restrictions on holiday accommodations. ""This is a good first step in getting the sector back up and running and a welcome indication that consumer confidence is high,"" said chief executive Kate Nicholls. However, the surge in bookings has sparked a wave of scams, according to UK Finance, trade group for the banking industry. The banking industry is warning holidaymakers to beware of fake caravan and villa holiday websites In a report published 19 June, the body highlighted in particular fake caravan and motorhome listings online, as well as criminals impersonating airlines and travel agencies. UK Finance says customers should ask to see caravans and motorhomes over a live video call before booking, since they can't view them in person. The group says customers searching for a UK holiday should pause and think before parting with their money online. ""Always be wary of any requests to pay by bank transfer when buying goods or services online and instead use the secure payment options recommended by reputable websites,"" advises UK Finance's Katy Worobec. UK Finance has also seen fake websites of villas and apartments offering unusually cheap deals. ""If something is advertised at a rock-bottom price, ask yourself why,"" said Ms Worobec. Best Western's Mr Denton said he could sense the excitement in a WhatsApp group for the firm's 300 UK hotel owners. ""It just went crazy. People are saying 'summer's back on',"" he says. Scotland, Northumberland, Yorkshire, Cornwall and Norfolk are the most searched for destinations, according to the company, while searches for city breaks and shopping trips in London and Manchester are down. Luxury hotel and spa provider Harbour Hotels has seen a similar trend. The group, which owns 15 hotels in England, says web traffic over the past few days is up 210% and bookings over the last few days have been particularly strong at coastal locations. Airbnb hosts also report city dwellers are looking for an escape to the outdoors after lockdown. Caroline Howell's cottage in the Cotswolds has been booked by Londoners ""dying to get out"" Caroline Howell, who rents out a cottage in Chedworth in the Cotswolds, has had six enquiries in the past 48 hours, mostly from ""people fatigued with city life and dying to get out"". ""Bookings for the summer were basically non-existent during lockdown, with everybody unsure as to how the situation would unfold,"" she says. ""A lot of my existing bookings were from Americans on a road trip of a lifetime. They have all cancelled. New bookings this week are not from abroad, but quick domestic getaways."" Airbnb owner Hannah Grace Lodge says customers are swapping their holiday abroad for a week on the coast in the UK It's been a similar experience for Hannah Grace Lodge, who runs an Airbnb property in Margate. She had lots of cancellations for her property, not just for dates during lockdown, but also further into the summer, due to the ongoing uncertainty about coronavirus lockdown measures, but now the property is fully booked for the rest of the summer. Hannah says her customers are booking much longer stays, whereas last year the demand was for short breaks: ""Our guests have messaged about how they are swapping their holiday abroad for a week or two on the coast in the UK.""

"Tesco says that customers have been buying more food during fewer shopping trips amid the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket said that while the number of trips made by shoppers fell by nearly a third in the 13 weeks to 30 May, the amount being bought rose 64%. In a trading update,external, Tesco said group sales had risen 8% to Â£13.4bn in the period, but warned coronavirus-related costs were set to hit Â£840m this year. Tesco's boss said it had been ""a very challenging period for everyone"". Like many of its rivals, Tesco was forced to overhaul its strategy in-store and online amid the coronavirus lockdown. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: ""In just five weeks, we doubled our online capacity to help support our most vulnerable customers and transformed our stores with extensive social distancing measures so that everyone who was able to shop in store could do so safely."" The supermarket says that it saw a substantial increase in costs as a result. They stemmed from offering 12 weeks' paid leave to 26,000 vulnerable workers and recruiting 47,000 temporary staff to cover sickness and meet demand. Across its UK & Ireland business, sales rose by 9.2% in the three months to 30 May. Online sales mainly drove the increase, jumping by 48.5% in the quarter. As more customers turned to online shopping, the firm ramped up online delivery slots and is now fulfilling more than 1.3 million online order per week. In UK stores, food sales also increased by about 12% as customers ""focused more on the purchase of their essential items"". Mr Lewis said that coronavirus-related costs had been ""only partly off-set"" by the sales boost and business rates relief. Tesco said it had benefitted from rates relief worth about Â£532m under the measures offered to shops in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Lockdown price hikes for beans and cleaning spray Tesco sells Polish supermarket business Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that customers stocking up during fewer trips ""wasn't a surprise"". ""Entering busy shops is something we're less inclined to do than a few short months ago. This change in habits has tangible benefits for Tesco, because its bigger stores and range of products are likely behind the higher number of customers switching to Tesco from discounters like Aldi."" In response to increasing pressure from budget retailers, Tesco introduced an ""Aldi price match"" promise in March. On Friday it said it would extend the offer to nearly 500 Tesco products. Tesco warned that its bank was expected to make a loss this year, as a result of the expected downturn in the economy following the coronavirus lockdown measures. It said it had increased its provision for potential bad debts, and now expected Tesco Bank to report of loss of between Â£175m and Â£200m in the current financial year. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group said that Tesco had ""clearly benefited from their revised strategy, helping them restore confidence in the group"". But he urged some caution: ""Investors should keep a close eye on the company, since the group operates in a crowded market with retailers Aldi and Lidl continuing to gain market share and current results might not be replicated when the UK is lifted from lockdown."" The trading update came ahead of the company's annual general meeting, where it is expected to face a shareholder revolt over its pay rules and plan to hand the outgoing boss a Â£6.4m pay deal. Its executives saw pay boosted last yearafter online supermarket Ocado was removed from a calculator used to set bonuses. Dave Lewis would have missed out on free shares worth about Â£1.6m if Ocado had stayed on a list used to compare rivals' success.

"The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has warned that it is likely to call in administrators. The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres are expected to stay open if it falls into administration, at least in the short term. Intu has already warnedthat longer term some of its centres may close. The company is the UK's biggest shopping centre group, with 17 centres in the UK and three in Spain. Should Intu fall into administration, the shopping centres are likely to remain open while the administrators decide what course of action they want to take. Options will include trying to sell the centres on to other potential buyers. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said he expected that most of Intu's shopping centres ""will live to fight another day"". ""Possibly not all, but most,"" he said. ""There are some very good and important centres in Intu's portfolio."" One of Intu's shopping centres is in Milton Keynes Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak, and about 132,000 jobs in the company and in its wider supply chain will be in question should the firm fall into administration. Retail expert Kate Hardcastle said one area of concern was Intu's Â£4.5bn debt, given the declining value of its shopping centres. They ""just aren't worth the value they once were"", she told BBC Breakfast. While the coronavirus crisis forced the closure of all non-essential shops, retailers had already been under pressure from a host of factors including changes in shopping habits as people move online. Big shopping centre landlords such as Intu rely on big retailers for their revenues - but in recent years retailers have been asking landlords for rent reductions due to the pressures they are under, Ms Hardcastle said. Mr Hyman said that retailers were already under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic, and had too much floor space. The pandemic had then speeded up a shift to online shopping. ""What would have taken five years to evolve - we're seeing that happen now,"" he said. ""People have been forced to shop online. When the dust settles, some of that spend will come back to physical stores - but not all of it will."" Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. In itsupdate to investors,externalon Friday, Intu said it had failed to reach agreement in discussions with lenders on so-called ""standstill"" terms, under which it would look to defer interest payments on its large and complex debts. It was also seeking agreements from its wide range of creditors, from big banks to hedge funds, for them not to take action if it breached certain terms on its loans.

"Thousands of Liverpool fans gathered at Anfield to celebrate their side's first title in 30 years Liverpool's 30-year wait for a top-flight title is over after Manchester Citylost 2-1at Chelsea to confirm the Reds as Premier League champions. Jurgen Klopp's side needed one victory to seal the league but City's failure to win means they cannot be caught. It is Liverpool's 19th top-flight title and their first since 1989-90. Despite being urged to ""stay home"" by the city's metro mayor because of coronavirus,thousands of fans gathered at Anfield to celebrate. Many of the supporters who congregated at the club's ground wore face masks and some lit flares. 'Absolutely incredible' - Klopp reacts to Liverpool title win How Klopp turned Liverpool into title winners - the inside story Rank the 10 games which have defined Klopp's reign Â£1.47bn spent, 239 players, nine permanent managers - Liverpool's 30-year wait in numbers A number of Reds players, including goalkeeper Alisson, defender Virgil van Dijk and midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,celebrated together after watching the Chelsea-City game.,external Klopp, wearing a Liverpool shirt and clearly emotional,,externaltold Sky Sports: ""I have no words, it's unbelievable. ""It's much more than I ever thought would be possible. Becoming champion with this club is absolutely incredible. ""I haven't waited 30 years - I have been here for four and a half years - but it is quite an achievement, especially with the three-month break because nobody knew if we could go on. ""I know it is difficult for people in this moment but we could not hold back. We will enjoy this with our supporters when we can."" Liverpool fans celebrate winning the Premier League for the first time As the global pandemic disrupted life in England and led to the suspension of the Premier League for three months, Liverpool supporters endured a nervous wait to see how the season would end, with some early suggestions it might have been declared null and void, thus wiping their remarkable efforts from the record books. The Premier League's return this month enabled them to cap their stunning success. However, because of the measures put in place in response to the virus, Liverpool will not be able to celebrate their long-awaited success with their supporters immediately, at least not in the traditional sense. As with Wednesday's impressive 4-0 win over Crystal Palace, when they next play at Anfield - against Aston Villa on Sunday 5 July, and for their two other remaining home games - it will be behind closed doors. It also seems unlikely they will be able to take part in any of the usual public events in Liverpool, such as an open-top bus parade around the city. By a quirk of fate, though, the next time they take to the field will be at the side they have beaten to this season's title and who pipped them so narrowly last campaign, Manchester City. Following their defeat at Chelsea, City boss Pep Guardiola congratulated Liverpool on their title success. This video can not be played Watch: The moment Liverpool players found out they were champions Winning the title was always the main aim for a club which endured such a long wait to be crowned champions of England again, having earned that honour 11 times between 1973 and 1990. Things could get better yet, with City's 100-point total for a season one of numerous records Liverpool can still break. Klopp's side have produced one of the most memorable campaigns in Premier League history, amassing 86 points with 28 victories, two draws and a single defeat from 31 games. Such has been their dominance, at one stage they led the table by 25 points - a record gap between a side in first and second in the English top flight. Liverpool this season v season average from previous 29 2019-20 Average (1990-91 to 2018-19) 28 Wins 19.57 2 Draws 9.72 1 Losses 9.14 70 Goals scored 65.45 21 Goals conceded 38.83 86 Points 68.57 90.32 Win % 50.81 Also still a possibility are the most wins in a season (the record is 32), most home wins (18), most away wins (16) and biggest winning margin (19 points). Their title win this season is the earliest on record, at least with regard to games remaining, with the Reds having seven to play. That it is not the earliest title win by date is only because of the halting of football in England between March and May as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This video can not be played Premier League: A lot has happened since Liverpool last won the league Liverpool's triumph represents a huge moment for their fans, who grew accustomed to success in the 1970s and 1980s, including a run between the 1972-73 and 1990-91 seasons in which they failed to finish first or second in the league only once. They have not been without silverware in the past 30 years, winning three FA Cups, four League Cups, a Uefa Cup, the Champions League twice - the latest coming last season under Klopp - as well as three Super Cups and one Club World Cup. However, since Kenny Dalglish led them to the First Division championship, they have had to endure three decades without league success, during which their record tally of titles was surpassed by rivals Manchester United, who have 20 to their name. It was during this period that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson famously revelled in having ""knocked Liverpool off their perch"". Liverpool have come close during that time to restoring themselves to the top of the English game, finishing second in the Premier League four times. Gerard Houllier (2001-02) and Rafael Benitez (2008-09) both took them close. Famously, in the 2013-14 season, Brendan Rodgers' side looked as though they were going to take the crown but a late-season slump - synonymous with a Steven Gerrard slip that enabled Chelsea to score and win at Anfield - saw them fall agonisingly short. Last season, they racked up a stunning 97 points, losing only one game all campaign, but had the misfortune of coming up against an even better Manchester City side, who beat them to the title by a point. No side had ever earned so many points without winning the league. This video can not be played 'We went a bit crazy!' Robertson and Milner react to Liverpool title win The appointment of Klopp has been pivotal to Liverpool's rise in recent seasons to this moment of success. The German arrived at Anfield in October 2015 following the sacking of Rodgers and with the club 10th in the Premier League. Klopp arrived with a record of success, having led Borussia Dortmund to two Bundesliga titles and the 2013 Champions League final, and with a reputation for fast-paced, high-pressing attacking play, which he described as ""heavy metal football"". His four full seasons to date have yielded finishing positions of fourth, fourth, second and now first. Intelligent dealing in the transfer market has also been key to his success, with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane signed during his reign. Along with Roberto Firmino, who arrived shortly before Klopp, the trio have scored a sensational 211 goals in less than three seasons (92 for Salah, 65 for Mane and 54 for Firmino). The additions of world-class goalkeeper Alisson and centre-back Virgil van Dijk were also crucial. Klopp has also improved players who were at the club before he arrived, including midfielder Jordan Henderson - his captain - and young full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. Klopp is the only Liverpool manager since Dalglish left (including the Scot himself during a second spell from January 2011 to May 2012) with a win percentage over 60. Dalglish delivered Liverpool their 16th, 17th and 18th league titles and now, after 30 years, they have found a fitting successor to provide them with their 19th. ""The last two years and since Jurgen's come in has been very positive,"" Dalglish told BT Sport. ""He's been fantastic and epitomises everything Liverpool football club stands for. Whatever they got, they have deserved it. ""Onwards and upwards. We have a lot more happy days to look forward to as long as Jurgen is here.""

"On 1 May 1990, Liverpool's players paraded the top-flight league-winners' trophy around a packed and joyous Anfield. They would not win the title again for another 30 years but the relative drought was not due to a lack of trying. Transfers were made, goals scored and games won, but it was never quite enough until this remarkable record-breaking season. Now thattheir wait is over,BBC Sport looks back at the players, managers, money and more that Liverpool have put in to the pursuit of number 19. How Klopp turned Liverpool into title winners - the inside story Rank the 10 games which have defined Klopp's reign Liverpool have played 1,149 games since the start of the 1990-91 season. That is 103,410 minutes (not including injury time) spent on the pitch in pursuit of that 19th title. They have won 595 of those matches (which is a win percentage of around 52%), scored 1,968 goals (for an overall goal difference of +822) and taken 2,075 points. However, all but 28 of those wins, 70 of those goals and 86 of those points were ultimately amassed in a vain attempt at league glory. The highest number of points they have claimed from a single opponent over the three decades is the 108 points they have taken off Tottenham from 60 encounters between the two. They have won 105 points against Merseyside rivals Everton, while West Ham have been plundered for 101. They have a 100% win record against Brighton, Cardiff, Huddersfield and Notts County, although the most number of times they have faced any of those sides is the five games they have played against the Seagulls. Unsurprisingly, the sides that have done the most consistent damage to Liverpool's title aspirations since 1990-91 are Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal - all multiple title winners during the Reds' barren three decades. Gallingly for Liverpool, they have just a 29.3% win percentage against fierce rivals United, who have beaten them 28 times in their 58 games since 1990-91. United also have comfortably the best goal difference against them too, with it currently standing at +8 in the Red Devils' favour. Birmingham (21.4% win percentage against) and Wimbledon (26.3%) have both been thorns in the Reds' side. There is only one team against whom Liverpool have played in the top flight and failed to take a single point in the past 30 seasons - Blackpool, who beat them home and away in their one Premier League campaign in 2010-11. Of course, no Liverpool season of the last 30 has matched 2019-20 for efficiency. In fact, no league campaign in English history is comparable to Liverpool's current one. As an indication of just why this season is the one that has ended their title drought, compare their 2019-20 stats with their average over the previous 29 seasonsâ¦ Liverpool this season vs season average from previous 29 2019-20 Average (1990-91 to 2018-19) 28 Wins 19.57 2 Draws 9.72 1 Losses 9.14 70 Goals scored 65.45 21 Goals conceded 38.83 86 Points 68.57 90.32 Win % 50.81 Since the start of the 1990-91 season, 239 players have represented Liverpool in the top flight. Their quest for a 19th title began with a 3-1 win at Sheffield United on 25 August 1990, the goals scored by John Barnes, Ray Houghton and Ian Rush. This was one of eight straight victories as part of a 14-game unbeaten run at the start of that season. Almost 30 years later, the job would finally be completed without the need to step on to the field asManchester City failed to beat Chelsea,finally ending a title race which in truth had been over for months. Of those 239 players, academy product Jamie Carragher has made the most league appearances in a Liverpool shirt in the past 30 years, playing in 508 games for the club. There are some familiar names in the top 10 appearance-makers in that time, but only one member of the current squad makes the list - captain Jordan Henderson, courtesy of his 266 matches. At the opposite end of the scale is a group of former players who contributed just one appearance to the cause - the likes of Daniele Padelli, David Raven, Jon Newby, Patrice Luzi, Istvan Kozma and Rafael Camacho. The goalscorers list is also topped by a home-grown talent in Robbie Fowler, who scored 128 league goals for the club over two spells. There is a much healthier modern presence, with current first-choice front three Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah all making the top 10. One player deserving of special recognition is Steven Gerrard, an individual intrinsically linked with Liverpool's long pursuit of their 19th title, for both positive and negative reasons. The midfielder and captain is a presence on both appearance and goals list, and has also contributed the most assists of any Liverpool player in the past 30 years (70). He was the driving force behind two of the major trophies the club have lifted since 1990 - the 2004-05 Champions League and 2005-06 FA Cup. Both thrilling 3-3 draws, both won on penalties, both with Gerrard as the game's key man. It is also impossible to think about a Liverpool title challenge without it evoking two images of the Merseyside-born England international - the first of him in in the middle of a huddle of Reds players, demanding that they ""don't let it slip"" and the second of him looking absolutely devastated at Anfield having done just that against Chelsea. Gerrard's slip allowed Demba Ba to score Chelsea's winner at Anfield in 2014 - a result that contributed to Liverpool missing out on the 2013-14 title Gerrard will never forget how Liverpool agonisingly allowed the 2013-14 title to elude them, but the club have at least now provided a positive moment to supersede it. Kenny Dalglish delivered Liverpool their 16th, 17th and 18th titles and began the defence of the latter as the Reds' manager. He would leave before that attempted defence was complete, shocking the club by resigning on 22 February 1991, with them three points clear at the top of the table. A combination of caretaker boss Ronnie Moran and permanent successor Graeme Souness were unable to retain the top-flight trophy, which instead went to Arsenal. In total, Liverpool have had nine permanent managers since the start of the 1990-91 season. This includes a rare joint-manager tenure at the start of the 1998-99 season between Roy Evans, who had been in sole charge but to diminishing returns for four seasons, and Gerard Houllier, who would continue on his own after Evans resigned just four months into the shared arrangement. Excluding Souness, who was only in charge for the final five games of 1990-91, four managers have taken Liverpool to within one place of league glory during the past 30 years - Houllier (2001-02), Rafael Benitez (2008-09), Brendan Rodgers (2013-14) and Jurgen Klopp (2018-19). All but Roy Hodgson (who didn't last a season in the job) and Rodgers (who came agonisingly close) won a trophy with the club. In Klopp, though, they have finally found a successor to King Kenny's crown. The German is the only Reds manager since Dalglish left (including the Scot himself during his second spell) with a win percentage over 60. Liverpool's first bit of transfer business following their 1989-90 title win was to make Ronny Rosenthal's loan move from Standard Liege permanent for a fee of around Â£1m. The Israeli striker, a cult figure at Anfield, would be the first of 218 signings the club would make between their 18th and 19th league triumphs, concluding with the Â£7.25m capture of Takumi Minamino in the last January window. Inevitably, there has been the good, the bad and the ugly. For every Luis Suarez or Virgil van Dijk, there is a Torben Piechnik, a Bruno Cheyrou and a Sean Dundee. And then there are the big-money disasters, more often than not failing forwards, like Andy Carroll (Â£35m, six goals in 44 league games), Christian Benteke (Â£32.5m, nine in 29) or Mario Balotelli (Â£16m, one in 16). Their most prolific period for signings was between 2005 and 2008, when the club brought in 40 players in just three seasons under Benitez. This included a number who served them well (Pepe Reina, Dirk Kuyt, Lucas Leiva and Fernando Torres), some not so well (Mark Gonzalez and Jermaine Pennant) and a few many won't remember (Gabriel Paletta and Sebastian Leto anyone?). Inevitably, the bills have added up over the past 30 years and according to figures from Transfermarkt, the club have spent an estimated Â£1.47bn on players between their 18th and 19th titles. It is important to note the Reds have also recouped a sizeable amount of money through player sales, reportedly Â£936.6m over those 30 years. Arguably, the best players that came into the side between 1990 and 2020 are the ones they got for nothing; academy graduates Robbie Fowler, Gerrard, Carragher, Michael Owen and Trent Alexander-Arnold. At the other end of the scale, though, are the likes of Van Dijk, Alisson and Naby Keita - the top three biggest deals the club have made in that time, with all three playing a prominent role in bringing Liverpool their 19th title. More often than not in modern football, you get what you pay for. Players come and go, but the constant at any club is its fans. The Liverpool supporters have had to wait longer than they imagined for this 19th title and have suffered some agonising near misses. They will also be denied the true experience of celebrating their side's charge towards the title this season with the last nine games being played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. But prior to this they have continued to show up at Anfield in vast numbers, season upon season. The difficulty in obtaining season-ticket numbers at the club means gauging an accurate tally of fans to have visited the ground since that celebration at the end of 1989-90 is impossible. But according to figures from Transfermarkt, the number of visits by supporters to Anfield over the past 30 years is 24,698,942.

"The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has warned that it is likely to call in administrators. The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres are expected to stay open if it falls into administration, at least in the short term. Intu has already warnedthat longer term some of its centres may close. The company is the UK's biggest shopping centre group, with 17 centres in the UK and three in Spain. Should Intu fall into administration, the shopping centres are likely to remain open while the administrators decide what course of action they want to take. Options will include trying to sell the centres on to other potential buyers. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said he expected that most of Intu's shopping centres ""will live to fight another day"". ""Possibly not all, but most,"" he said. ""There are some very good and important centres in Intu's portfolio."" One of Intu's shopping centres is in Milton Keynes Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak, and about 132,000 jobs in the company and in its wider supply chain will be in question should the firm fall into administration. Retail expert Kate Hardcastle said one area of concern was Intu's Â£4.5bn debt, given the declining value of its shopping centres. They ""just aren't worth the value they once were"", she told BBC Breakfast. While the coronavirus crisis forced the closure of all non-essential shops, retailers had already been under pressure from a host of factors including changes in shopping habits as people move online. Big shopping centre landlords such as Intu rely on big retailers for their revenues - but in recent years retailers have been asking landlords for rent reductions due to the pressures they are under, Ms Hardcastle said. Mr Hyman said that retailers were already under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic, and had too much floor space. The pandemic had then speeded up a shift to online shopping. ""What would have taken five years to evolve - we're seeing that happen now,"" he said. ""People have been forced to shop online. When the dust settles, some of that spend will come back to physical stores - but not all of it will."" Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. In itsupdate to investors,externalon Friday, Intu said it had failed to reach agreement in discussions with lenders on so-called ""standstill"" terms, under which it would look to defer interest payments on its large and complex debts. It was also seeking agreements from its wide range of creditors, from big banks to hedge funds, for them not to take action if it breached certain terms on its loans.

"It may be a year before Darren Hiles can walk again Taxi drivers have been left without ""adequate protection and guidance"" despite many working throughout the lockdown, industry leaders say. Figures show,externalthe profession has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 deaths. Drivers, taxi firms and industry bodies have said national safety guidance is urgently needed. Government advice says drivers can refuse to take passengers who are not wearing face coverings. Many companies now provide masks and hand sanitiser, but some drivers say they have to pay for their own protection at a time when they are struggling financially. Some report being so ""desperate"" they have made DIY protective screens out of cling film. Most taxi and private-hire drivers are male, and a high proportion are from black, Asian and ethnic minority (Bame) backgrounds - two of the groups at high risk from coronavirus. Over the past three months, drivers say their main jobs have been transporting NHS staff, key workers, patients and the vulnerable. Darren Hiles spent weeks being treated in intensive care While most of us stayed at home, private hire driver Darren Hiles spent the start of lockdown working on Merseyside. ""I wasn't given a mask, but everything was a bit unknown at that time,"" he says. ""Me being me, I thought I would be OK."" The 48-year-old was admitted to intensive care on 7 April, where he would spend the next six weeks, including four on a ventilator. His partner Heidi Neilson was warned on several occasions that he could die. ""I couldn't believe what the virus had done to him,"" she says. ""He looked like a corpse. I barely recognised him. ""Our kids wanted to see their dad and I had to wave them away because I didn't want them to see him like that."" Darren is now out of hospital but it may be a year before he can walk again. He is not sure if he will return to his job, but says his fellow drivers deserve better protection. ""I'm convinced I contracted coronavirus through my job. We were in lockdown when I was infected. The only interaction I had I was at home or at work."" Heidi agreed: ""I work in a care home and we are given protective equipment.  What makes me more deserving then a taxi driver who is also doing an important job? ""The supply should be there for any frontline worker. It's not just about the driver, it's about customer safety."" Figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show male taxi cab drivers and chauffeurs had higher rates of deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales. Higher than doctors, nurses and care workers. Scientists believe private-hire drivers are particularly at risk - and the longer the journey, the bigger the risk. ""Unlike black cabs, there is no physical barrier separating the driver and the passengers,"" says Dr Joe Grove, a virologist at University College London. ""People are close together and if the windows aren't open, the air can be quite stagnant. ""An infected passenger releases microscopic droplets containing the virus. Even after they've left the car, the virus will remain."" Sociologist Dr Mark Williams from Queen Mary University of London says taxi and private-hire drivers are among the worst hit because they face many risk factors. ""They can't do their job from home, and their job makes it hard to socially distance, but they're also self-employed so need to work."" While drivers can claim the government's self-employment income support scheme, worth 80% of their trading profits, Mr Williams says many are not eligible. James Farrar, from the App Drivers and Couriers Union, said it was ""unforgiveable"" drivers had been working for the last three months without adequate protection and advice. He added: ""The government has given contradictory advice on masks and no regulatory guidance on plastic-screen partitions."" Firms like TC Cars in Birmingham have set up protective screens which the driver has to wipe after every journey Currently, Scotland is the only part of the UK where it is mandatory for passengers to wear face coverings in taxis and private-hire cars. In England, it is mandatory on public transport, and in Wales and Northern Ireland it is recommended. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport in England said passengers needed to ""think of the safety of drivers"" and wear face coverings, even if they were not required to. But Mr Farrar is concerned that the ""burden of refusal"" is on drivers who might face pressure to accept work from their firms. Not all councils allow plastic partitions, and installing them is a cost many drivers say they cannot afford. Matt Young, who co-owns Shrewsbury Taxis, said he had heard ""horror stories"" of drivers making screens out of ""shower curtains and cling film"". He said screens should be properly fitted and meet official criteria. He added: ""We would recommend wearing a face mask. Sit as far away as you can from the driver with the windows open, use hand sanitiser and pay with your [bank or credit] card.""

"US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (centre) welcomed the bill The US House of Representatives has passed a sweeping police reform bill that currently has little prospect of becoming law amid partisan gridlock. The Democratic-controlled chamber voted 236-181 for the measure mainly along party lines on Thursday night. The legislation is named after George Floyd, the unarmed black man whose death in police custody last month ignited worldwide protests. But US President Donald Trump has threatened to veto the measure. And his fellow Republicans in the Senate are proposing their own, less far-reaching bill. What US police officers think of protests The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was passed exactly a month after the Minneapolis, Minnesota, man's death - at warp speed for a usually deliberative and ponderous legislative body. The Democratic bill would hold police officers personally liable for damages in lawsuits, ban no-knock warrants often used by police in drug raids, and halt the flow of military surplus equipment to police departments. This video can not be played Four numbers that explain impact of George Floyd Three Republicans crossed party lines to vote in favour. But Senate Republicans have refused to take up the House version, arguing it is an overreach that would undermine law enforcement. Both the Republican and Democratic proposals would curtail police chokeholds, introduce new training procedures, seek to expand the use of body cameras and create a national registry for officers accused of misconduct. However, Democrats say the Republican bill will not protect black Americans, arguing that it relies on data collection and financial incentives for state and local police departments to adopt reforms on their own. This video can not be played Three black parents and their children have discussions about raising a black child, racism and the Black Lives Matter movement On Wednesday, Senate Democrats denied Republicans the votes needed to open floor debate on their legislation. President Trump said: ""If nothing happens with it, it's one of those things. We have different philosophies."" Neither bill would defund the police, and divert that spending to other community services, as called for by Black Lives Matter activists. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gathered with members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the Capitol steps on Thursday and said:  ""Exactly one month ago, George Floyd spoke his final words - 'I can't breathe' - and changed the course of history."" Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said: ""Here in America, every black mother and every black father has to have the talk with their child about what to do when approached by police. But Debbie Lesko, an Arizona Republican, said: ""All lives matter."" This video can not be played What happened when a city disbanded its police force And Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican, was quoted by the Washington Post as saying of Democrats: ""They don't want to talk about it when white people are killed."" Tim Scott, the Senate's only Black Republican and author of the chamber's failed police reform bill, accused Democrats of playing ""pure race politics"" ahead of November's general election. ""There will be blood on the Democrats' hands,"" Mr Scott of South Carolina told Fox News, if more black Americans died because of congressional inaction.

"The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has warned that it is likely to call in administrators. The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres are expected to stay open if it falls into administration, at least in the short term. Intu has already warnedthat longer term some of its centres may close. The company is the UK's biggest shopping centre group, with 17 centres in the UK and three in Spain. Should Intu fall into administration, the shopping centres are likely to remain open while the administrators decide what course of action they want to take. Options will include trying to sell the centres on to other potential buyers. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said he expected that most of Intu's shopping centres ""will live to fight another day"". ""Possibly not all, but most,"" he said. ""There are some very good and important centres in Intu's portfolio."" One of Intu's shopping centres is in Milton Keynes Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak, and about 132,000 jobs in the company and in its wider supply chain will be in question should the firm fall into administration. Retail expert Kate Hardcastle said one area of concern was Intu's Â£4.5bn debt, given the declining value of its shopping centres. They ""just aren't worth the value they once were"", she told BBC Breakfast. While the coronavirus crisis forced the closure of all non-essential shops, retailers had already been under pressure from a host of factors including changes in shopping habits as people move online. Big shopping centre landlords such as Intu rely on big retailers for their revenues - but in recent years retailers have been asking landlords for rent reductions due to the pressures they are under, Ms Hardcastle said. Mr Hyman said that retailers were already under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic, and had too much floor space. The pandemic had then speeded up a shift to online shopping. ""What would have taken five years to evolve - we're seeing that happen now,"" he said. ""People have been forced to shop online. When the dust settles, some of that spend will come back to physical stores - but not all of it will."" Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. In itsupdate to investors,externalon Friday, Intu said it had failed to reach agreement in discussions with lenders on so-called ""standstill"" terms, under which it would look to defer interest payments on its large and complex debts. It was also seeking agreements from its wide range of creditors, from big banks to hedge funds, for them not to take action if it breached certain terms on its loans.

"Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow. Six people were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The incident happened in the stairwell of the Park Inn Hotel on West George Street in the centre of Glasgow at about 12:50 The hotel has been housing asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident Ms Sturgeon said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. BBC Scotland News That brings us to the end of BBC Scotland's live coverage of a major incident in Glasgow which left six people with stab wounds. The suspect was shot dead by police officers.  Any further developments will be reported on the BBC News website. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken says ""division is the last thing we need"" The leader of Glasgow City Council was asked about a suggestion that Glasgow was a ""powder keg"" - and that the incident could lead to further disorder in the city. Earlier this month there were violent scenes in the city when far right supporters turned up at a rally in support of refugees. Susan Aitken told Reporting Scotland: ""I would absolutely urge anyone not to politicise this, not to use this to divide the city."" Ms Aitken said Glasgow had faced tragedy in the past - and would come through it by supporting each other and not allowing communities to be divided. ""There has been a lot of speculation this afternoon which hasn't been helpful which doesn't help. It's not fair to the victims, it's not fair to the victims' families and it doesn't help the city,"" she said. ""Glasgow needs to pull together, we need to have each others' backs and support our communities through this. Division is the last thing we need.""  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked the Police Scotland chief constable Iain Livingstone for the exceptional bravery of his officers at today's incident in Glasgow, No 10 Downing Street has revealed. ""The PMâs thoughts remain with the injured and their loved ones,"" it said, pointing out that he had spoken to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Mr Johnson has also held a meeting with
the Home Secretary and senior police officers, in which he was updated. Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says it is
âreassuringâ that the stabbing incident in Glasgow is not being treated as a terrorist incident, but it is still a ""deeply distressing time for everyone involved"". The Park Inn Hotel was being used to house asylum seekers while
their own accommodation was being refurbished. ""Without getting into speculation about any kind of connection, we can say Glasgow is a city with a long and proud history of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers,"" Mr Harvie told BBC News. ""It is also a city where there has been a strong desire to
treat refugees and asylum seekers with decency. That hasnât always been the case in the UK asylum system."" Mr Harvie claimed the way asylum seekers have been treated during the recent coronavirus crisis is ""clearly well short of
adequate"".   Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said that while there is no wider risk to the public, West George Street remains closed as investigations continue and the public should avoid the area. ""As would be the case in any police discharge of firearms
involving a fatality, the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service has instructed the police investigations and review commissioner
to investigate,"" he added. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland ""Don't be alarmist and spread unsubstantiated rumours or claims,"" Labour MSP for Glasgow, Anas Sarwar, has urged the public. He asked them to remember that ""human beings"" were killed and injured at the Glasgow hotel. ""It is really sad and really distressing and I've seen on social media already people trying to dehumanise them and label them as asylum seekers, etc,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""But these are, first and foremost, human beings and human beings who are going through horror today. They are fellow Glaswegians who are going through horror today."" Mr Sarwar pointed out that there was a protest last week over ""how asylum seekers have been treated"" saying they were kicked out of their accommodation amidst the coronavirus pandemic. He said: ""They have fled tyranny, violence and danger abroad and sadly they have been amidst violence and danger today."" Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson has just given a brief update near the scene of the stabbings. He said the first report came in at 12:50 and officers were on the scene within two minutes. He confirms that the incident is not being treated as terrorism, and that armed officers shot dead a man. A 42-year-old police officer was wounded and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Five other men are also in hospital, aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland BBC Scotland reporter Gillian Sharpe is outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: ""This is the closest hospital to the scene of this afternoon's incident. Six people are being treated in hospital - here, and at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital across the city. ""One of them is the police officer and their condition is described as critical. Their family has been informed."" Police Scotland say one person was shot dead by armed police in the incident in Glasgow Six men were injured including a 42-year-old police officer who is critical but stable in hospital The ages of the other injured are 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Craig Milroy was working nearby and saw a badly injured man lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""I saw a man with no T-shirt, no shoes lying on the ground with what looked like a stab wound with someone compressing the wound,"" he told the BBC News Channel ""We looked further up and we saw a large police presence. Then we saw the man with the stab wound being taken away in an ambulance being put on oxygen. ""After that the police came over, told us to move into our office and lock the doors. That's when the alarm bells started ringing."" He said he saw up to seven people being taken away in ambulances. ""The man we saw, it looked maybe like he had tried to run away from the hotel. The man we saw outside our office, it looked like maybe he tried to escape any incident that happened but before that it looked like everything was happening within the hotel.""  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Allan Burnett, a policing expert who worked on the  investigation into the Glasgow Airport terror attack in June 2007, told BBC Radio Scotland there would be a huge ongoing operation at the scene. He said: ""The incident is still live so there's a degree of crowd control going on and there will be a massive scene preservation and examination, including speaking to witnesses. ""A senior investigating officer will also be appointed and the firearms team that were involved will be subject to a debrief."" Responding to the news that the stabbings took place at a hotel that was housing asylum seekers, Nicola Sturgeon had this message to ""people across Glasgow and across Scotland"". ""When dreadful things like this happen, they shock all of us to our core but above all they should remind us of what unites us and not what divides us,"" she said. She continued: ""The people of Glasgow are wonderful people, and I'm sure tonight there will be a coming together in the city of Glasgow and all of us, reminding of us what unites us as human beings."" The whole country, the whole world is going through a really tough and traumatic time at the moment and this is an opportunity, a time to think of each other and the care we owe each other. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland The first minister confirms that the injured police officer remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.  The injury of a police officer, of course, reminds us of the bravery of our police service. They run towards dangers as the rest of us would run away. Nicola Sturgeon First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the violent attack in Glasgow city centre. The police have confirmed that one person has died after being shot by officers. Ms Sturgeon said her thoughts are with the six people injured after being stabbed in the attack, one of them a police officer. She said the attack ""reminds us of the bravery"" of police officers, who in this case ensured that a very serious incident did not become even worse. The first minister said it is not currently being treated as a terrorist incident - ""but there are still details yet to be determined"". Allow Twitter content?

Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent A well-placed Whitehall source who had previously said that three people had died in Glasgow now says that ONE person is confirmed to have died - the suspected attacker, who was shot by police. Matthew Nisbet, who was working near the scene of the stabbings, said police were there ""within two or three minutes of everything kicking off"". He told the BBC's Connor Gillies he could see a badly-injured man who later died lying on the steps outside the hotel. ""We could see a person with a deep wound and blood all over the steps. I think I heard two shots but I couldn't be certain. We were cleared from the scene pretty quick by the police. They were absolutely incredible, all of them."" He estimated that there were 100-150 police on the scene within five minutes - an ""incredible response"". ""I would say to them thank you, and I would say to them they are brave and they are heroes,"" he said.  Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme it was a ""tragic thing that has happened in our city"". ""I think all Glaswegians will share that devastation,"" she said. ""Our heart goes out to the victims and their families and the brave police officer who was injured. I am incredibly grateful to our police and emergency services who were on the scene. ""The city is going to have to pull together and support each other to get through this."" She added: ""We don't want Glasgow divided because of this incident. Speculation about motive isn't helpful.""

"This video can not be played Mass brawl erupts at Ogmore-by-Sea Lockdown restrictions will not be eased if large parties and fights at beaches continue in Wales, the first minister has warned. Videos on social media showed large crowds at Ogmore-by-Sea, Vale of Glamorgan, followed by violent clashes on Thursday evening. Current travel restrictions areset to be lifted on 6 July. But Mark Drakeford said if the behaviour continued he would ""not be able to continue easing restrictions"". Leader of Vale of Glamorgan council Neil Moore called the scenes ""disgraceful"" and said those causing disorder showed a ""complete disregard"" for their own and the community's safety. He added: ""A major clean-up operation is now under way. The car park at Ogmore beach has been closed and will remain so until at least the beginning of next week."" Residents clearing up litter on the beach shared photos of empty cannisters of nitrous oxide Vicky Fry, who lives in Ogmore-by-Sea, said the police response was ""appalling"" and ""very delayed"". ""They should have done a little bit more for the residents and local people,"" she added. Speaking toGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Walesshe said the party went on late into the night after the incident, adding it was not a one-off but an ""ongoing thing"" locals had to deal with. South Wales Police said two men in their 20s had been detained following the fight in Ogmore-by-Sea at about 20:00 BST on Thursday. Det Ch Insp Tom Moore said the scenes at the beach were ""totally unacceptable"" and the force was working to ""identify those who were responsible"". ""We believe that a large number of youths have travelled to the area from various areas of south Wales to become involved in serious, violent disorder,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said the scenes ""threaten the health of people in Wales and undermine the sacrifices the majority of people have made during this ongoing crisis"". Allow Twitter content?

But he said at a press conference that the ""ugly actions"" of a few people should not ""cast a shadow"" over the efforts made by the wider population. South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael described it as a ""contagion of stupidity"" and said people were ""completely ignoring the risk to public health"". Residents also reported crowds of people partying in Barry Island, and beaches in Swansea, with one describing it as a nightly ""Spring Break"" party on beaches near their home. Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport Lee Waters said the scenes were the actions of a ""bunch of drunked-up young people"", but if it kept happening the Welsh Government would have to ""look again at the lockdown rules"". In Wales, it is illegal to gather in large groups and people are advised not to travel outside of their local area because of the coronavirus pandemic. Social distancing measures also remain in place. Beachgoers told to avoid public transport Quarry swimming warning ahead of hot weather Sun-seekers urged to stay away from packed beach But on Thursday police, the council, and the RNLI had to respond after crowds gathered at Ogmore-by-Sea, as temperatures soared across Wales. The force tweeted a plea to parents to ""check where your children are"" on Thursday evening after reports of ""large numbers of young people"" gathering on the coast. The force said it was ""aware of videos circulating on social media"" and inquiries were ongoing. The beach has since been closed by the council Ogmore resident Sue Francombe said the scenes at the beach on Thursday evening were ""absolute carnage"". She added: ""We've been in lockdown for weeks and then I couldn't believe what was happening. ""I've been here for 16 years and we've never had this before. I feel really angry and upset."" Gerald McCarthy, who lives above the beach, said it was ""absolutely horrendous"", with roads and side streets leading to the beach ""utter chaos"". But he said the beach should not be closed as it was used by walkers and families in the daytime. Another resident, who did not want to be named, said it had been ""building for a few days"" with more people heading to the beach, and by Thursday ""a few hundred were drinking"" on the seafront. Porthcawl RNLI confirmed it had attended an incident on Thursday evening and ""assisted 45 people who were trapped at the river mouth by the incoming tide"". Allow Twitter content?

The Welsh Ambulance Service said it had also been called. Former Conservative leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, who is based in the Vale of Glamorgan, tweeted about ""some pretty ugly scenes"" on the beach. Member of the Senedd Carwyn Jones, who represents the nearby Bridgend constituency, said he expected ""beach closures are now needed for a while"" following the incident. South Wales Police said it broke up the crowds at the beach at about 20:00, with the council forced to close the car park. But the police were called again to the beach at 22:50 after some of the earlier group returned. The force said that while witnesses reported someone had been hurt, as of late Thursday evening, no victims had been identified or had come forward. Det Ch Insp Moore said the force would be ""doing everything we can to ensure there is no repeat of this behaviour"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a separate incident, Vale of Glamorgan council enforcement officers said they were faced with ""a number of hostile and aggressive youths"" tombstoning at Rhoose Point on Thursday night. The officers tweeted the ""behaviour was unacceptable"" and it would be taking further action against the youths. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Michael said it was ""disappointing"" scenes of packed beaches in England were now spreading to Wales. He said that the issue was spreading via social media and there was a lot of confused messages on platforms, but not observing social distancing was putting ""everybody at risk"". Responding to questions about why police did not stop people flocking to the beach before the fight, Mr Michael said there was a ""difficult balance"" to keep, but it was ""not something where you could enforce your way out of it"". ""The police will enforce if it is absolutely necessary, but that's the last resort if people don't use common sense,"" he said. ""We need people to use common sense and that has been the characteristic in south Wales throughout the pandemic to date. It seems to becoming a bit apart."" Residents were out cleaning up the beach at Ogmore on Friday morning following the brawl Under current coronavirus guidelines in Wales, people from two different households are able to meet outdoors, but must maintain social distancing. As a guideline, people meeting outside should do so within five miles of their home - there is no restriction on the number of people at any one time, but getting together with members of more than one household at the same time is illegal. On Thursday peoplewere urged not to use public transport to get to beaches, due to the travel restrictions, and to keep trains and buses free for key workers. But on Thursday evening, images appearing to show coaches leaving Barry Island were posted on social media, and people tweeted trains were crowded with people sitting on taped-off seats. Transport for Wales said: ""Yesterday [Thursday] as a result of an influx of non-essential travel to seaside locations we quickly had to arrange additional coaches, the decision to put on this additional transport was to ensure our essential travellers and key workers could still get to their destinations safely. ""We'd like to take this opportunity to remind people that public transport is for essential travel and where there are no other travel alternatives."" The first minister said repeated scenes of people breaching rules could have an impact on the Welsh Government's approach to easing the lockdown.""If we were to see some scenes like that last night, continuing to happen and if they were a more general breakdown of the efforts that we all have made in that would inevitably have an impact on our ability to go on, lifting restrictions,"" he said. Mr Waters said young people had become ""very frustrated"" after being compliant for a long time. ""You see the first bit of hot sun and out come the beers and a couple of idiots ruin it for others,"" he said. ""There are inevitably flare-ups, especially young men who have had too much to drink in hot weather behaving stupidly, but I don't think you can then draw the conclusion that [lockdown] is breaking down across Wales.""

"Temple Court said it had been ""completely overwhelmed"" by Covid-19 A care home at the centre of a police investigation after the deaths of 15 residents during the coronavirus pandemic has been rated inadequate. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) identified ""serious failings which led to people suffering harm"" at Temple Court care home in Kettering. The home wasclosed in May amid serious concerns from the CQCafter a major coronavirus outbreak. Temple Court said it had been ""completely overwhelmed"" by Covid-19. ""We are astonished the CQC report has chosen to disregard the reason why standards at Temple Court deteriorated - the home was completely overwhelmed due to the Covid-19 epidemic,"" a spokesman said. ""An influx of residents from the NHS in late March led to an outbreak of Covid-19 which affected existing residents and a large proportion of staff, including the manager and entire senior team. ""This left the home disproportionately reliant on the use of available agency staff, with very little opportunity to adequately train them on our policies and procedures."" Inspectors who visited Temple Court on 12 and 13 May found the care home had not informed the CQC about serious incidents without delay, including when people died or suffered injuries. The CQC found residents' health had deteriorated through a lack of oversight at the home and an insufficient understanding of residents' needs. Deanna Westwood, CQC head of inspection for adult social care, said: ""Our inspection of Temple Court identified serious failings which led to people suffering harm."" She said the situation at the home was ""unacceptable"" and added the service was not currently in use and no new residents would be admitted ""unless we are fully assured that they can be cared for safely"". The CQC report,externalsaid people had been malnourished and dehydrated because of poor management of their diets. It said the home admitted 15 people when it did not have resources to meet their needs, while several people had to go to hospital with dehydration. Other failings included observations not always being completed, staff not always seeking medical care when it was needed, infection prevention and control - including relating to catheter care - not being well managed, and insufficient measures to protect people from falls. How big is the epidemic in care homes? Care providers 'will go to the wall' without cash Live updates from the East of England All of the home's 21 residents were moved out by the end of the second day of the inspection. That decision was made by the Nene Clinical Commissioning Group and Northamptonshire County Council. Evidence of unexplained injuries found by the CQC inspectors were being looked into by the county council as part of an investigation under section 42 of the Care Act, which would happen in cases when there were allegations of abuse or neglect.

Here's a roundup of Friday's biggest coronavirus stories:  Our live coverage was brought to you by our BBC teams in the UK and abroad: Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Alexandra Fouche, Hugo Bachega, Patrick Jackson, Victoria Bisset, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea, Holly Honderich, Sophie Williams, Katie Wright, Alix Kroeger and Rob Corp. We will soon be ending our coronavirus live coverage for today. But before we leave, here's a chance to catch
up on Friday's main developments across the UK:  Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington It was a tough week for the White House. The number of cases has shot up in Florida, Texas, Mississippi and other states where governors have tried to reinforce President Trumpâs message that the nationâs returning to normal. The spike in cases has alarmed many people, and Vice President Mike Pence expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Then he tried to put a gloss on the situation. White House officials have much to be proud of, he said, explaining that they have made âremarkable progressâ in moving the country forward: âWe slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.â His self-congratulatory tone was surprising, given the dire news, and his effort to put a positive spin on things seemed jarring. One thing was clear, however: Pence has had a tough job from the start, trying to support the presidentâs controversial positions. Penceâs performance on Friday was an especially difficult â and unconvincing - one. Kate Scotter and Laura DevlinBBC News After the hottest day of the year saw thousands of people descend on beaches around the UK, the BBC went to Great Yarmouth on the east coastto see the scale of the mess left behind. The refuse collector's cart is overflowing. There's the usual drinks cans and plastic bottles, but also a crumpled hat, a paperback book and, balanced on top, a wind break. ""It's as if people have gone slightly mad with lockdown easing,"" says Penny Carpenter, as she helps pick up rubbish along Great Yarmouth beach. With cafes and restaurants only open for takeaways, much of the litter is polystyrene cups and burger cartons, plastic bottles and cans. Rubbish bins have been filling up quicker than they can be emptied. Ms Carpenter said in the 16 years she has lived in the coastal town, she has never seen anything like the amount of litter left in recent days. Joe TidyCyber-security reporter For the last two years, Hadi Damien's big plans for celebrating Pride in Lebanon have been destroyed. In 2018, he was arrested and detained minutes into a recital of a play about homophobia. He was released, but had to cancel the rest of the week-long Pride events he and his team had organised. Then last year, the centrepiece concert of Beirut Pride had to be called off after violent threats were made against the venue and participants. At the start of 2020, Hadi and his team of volunteers were determined not to be put off and had begun to plan some Pride events when, once again, everything was cancelled. This time though Hadi's difficulties were truly global...

They have been issued following clusters of cases at Welsh food factories - including 2 Sisters on Anglesey, Rowan Foods in Wrexham and Kepak in Merthyr Tydfil. The guidelines emphasise social distancing and ask staff to work and take breaks in small groups. ""Cohorts"" should be formed, particularly if staff live together and travel to work with each other. It also says staff should not lose pay if they have to self-isolate. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent If Northern Ireland does manage to release a functioning contact tracing app within weeks that will be a major embarrassment to the UK government. After all, in England an NHS team managed to spend four months and nearly Â£12m ($15m) developing a centralised app that did not work. Health Secretary Matt Hancock then announced that the new focus would be on a decentralised app using the Google Apple toolkit - but that was unlikely to be ready for months. Then this week the prime minister assured the House of Commons that no country in the world had a working contact tracing app. Yet Northern Ireland's health minister seems confident that a few weeks' work, perhaps building on the experience of Germany and other countries which have released decentralised apps, can deliver something that will do the job and even be compatible with the Irish Republic's project. The NHS X team had always hoped its app would be rolled out across the UK - now perhaps it's Northern Ireland which will provide a high tech contact tracing solution that all four home nations can use. Northern Ireland is planning to release its own coronavirus contact-tracing app within weeks, the BBC has learned. It follows the failure of the National Health Service app in England, which was trialled on the Isle of Wight. The NI app will be based on the Google/Apple model. It is designed to be compatible with an app due to be released soon in the Republic of Ireland. The Apple and Google model is more privacy-focused but provides less data to epidemiologists than the centralised version that England was trialling - although that was ditched last week as the government madea U-turn. Prof Neil Ferguson's advice led to the UK government's decision to go into lockdown Prof Neil Ferguson, a former UK government adviser whose advice led to the decision to go into lockdown, has said he does not believe a second national lockdown would be necessary. Instead, he said he would expect to see ""targeted"" restrictions to contain outbreaks. He also said the easing of restrictions needed to be monitored ""very closely"". The UK should ""be prepared to row back a bit if we start seeing increases in case numbers,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme. Thenext series of measures to ease the lockdownwill take place in England on 4 July, when the two-metre (6ft) social-distancing rule will be reduced to ""one metre plus"". Prof Ferguson said he ""did not disagree"" with the policy changes announced this week and did not expect to see ""very large growth of cases across the country"" as a result. ""What I do expect to see, depending on how sensible people are, how much they judge the risks themselves and reduce those risks, is clusters of cases,"" he said. But he added he believed there would be ""a bigger potential risk of more widespread community transmission"" as the UK goes into autumn and winter. The White House briefing has come to an end. Here's what we learned: Pence appeared to deny any link between states reopening and the increase in cases in the south. Responding to a reporter's question, he said: ""I think there will be a temptation for people to look at these sunbelt states that have been reopening and putting people back to work, and suggest that reopening has to do with what we're seeing in the last week or so. ""But frankly in the case of each of these states, they reopened - in some cases - almost two months ago. And their test cases, their new cases from testing was low and steady, their positivity rate was low."" Pence blames much of the rise on positive test results from asymptomatic young people. ""We're seeing more and more young people under the age of 35 who are testing positive - in many cases they have no symptoms, but they're coming forward,"" he says, adding that while they may be at lower risk of serious symptoms, they should ""take countermeasures"" and listen to state governors' advice. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, told the White House briefing, ""America has never been readier to combat Covid-19."" In addition to surveillance and testing capabilities, Azar said the country now had ""promising therapeutics that are benefiting tens of thousands of American patients and that have already saved thousands of lives"". He said provision of the most ""promising"" treatments, remdesivir and dexamethasone (the cheap and widely available drug which has shown promising results), had already begun, with 120,000 courses of remdesivir allocated to states and dexamethasone added to guidelines. Convalescent plasma has been used on more than 25,000 patients, Azar said. He added that there were more than 140 clinical trials in the US, with large investments in three vaccines - which have now reached human trials - ""some with the potential to start delivering safe and effective doses before the end of the year"". Rachel SchraerHealth reporter Coronavirus patients in hospital in England are dying at a slower rate now than they were at the peak of the epidemic, analysis suggests. University of Oxford researchers,externalfound the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. Improvements in treatments, changes in the patient population and seasonal effects could all play a role. Around the height of the outbreak, on 8 April, there were 15,468 people in hospital in England with coronavirus, of whom 899 died (6%). By 21 June there were 2,698 hospitalised coronavirus patients, 30 of whom died (1%), according to the most recent data. While the number of people in hospital and the number of hospitalised people dying are both falling, deaths are falling at a faster rate. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 is halving every 29 days, while deaths are halving every 16 days. Prof Carl Heneghan, who carried out the analysis, said the pattern of falling death rates in hospitals was also being seen in other countries, including Italy. ""We should be investigating what's changed,"" he said. ""It's a radically different disease we're looking at if the death rate is 1% rather than 6%"". Read more here. Flanked by Dr Birx and Dr Fauci, Vice-President Mike Pence takes questions during the White House task force briefing Responding to questions from reporters, Vice-President Mike Pence defended President Trump's decision to hold two campaign rallies, one of them in Phoenix, Arizona, one of the two US states now leading the country in positive virus tests. ""We have an election coming up this fall,"" Pence says. ""We
still want to give people the freedom to participate in the political process."" The vice-president adds that the right to assemble and the right to free speech are enshrined in the US Constitution. ""People are using common sense, they're being responsible,"" he says, insisting that, between states, ""one size doesn't fit all"". The state of emergency was declared on 16 March on the Isle of Man The state of emergency on the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency, has been lifted more than three months after it was first declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The island announced on 17 June that it hadachieved ""local elimination"" of coronavirus. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island was in an ""enviable and rare position"" as life returned to ""relatively normal"". A threat from the virus remained but it was a chance to ""breathe and pause for reflection"", he added. Read more Top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci notes the ""serious problem"" of rising cases in certain areas of the country. Dr Fauci then urges Americans to respect their ""societal responsibility"" to help slow the spread. ""A risk for you is not just isolated to you,"" he says. ""Because if you get infected you are part - innocently or inadvertently - of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic."" ""If we want to end this outbreak, really end itâ¦
weâve got to realise that we are part of this process,"" he says. ""The only way we're going to end it is by ending it together."" Pence has said there is still ""work to do"" and called on younger people to play a role in halting the spread of Covid-19. ""And so we say to every American, particularly those in counties and in states that are being impacted by rising cases, that now is the time for everybody to continue to do their part,"" he said. ""And I think you'll hear from this podium today a particular message for younger Americans across the sunbelt [southern US states] and the role that you can play in protecting the vulnerable."" ""Recognise that this is different than two months ago,"" he said, ""both in our ability to respond and in the nature of those that are being infected and that younger Americans have a particular responsibility to make sure that theyâre not carrying the coronavirus into settings where they would expose the most vulnerable."" White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx says officials now have a better understanding of who is at risk of infection and death from Covid-19, namely those over 80 years old and with co-morbidities like diabetes and significant obsesity, as well as how the virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers. âThanks
to the millennials who have been heeding our guidance they have been coming
forward and getting testingâ¦ now we are telling them to get tested,â Dr Birx says. âIt
allows us to find the asymptomatic and mild diseases that we couldnât find
before.â Noting the rising cases in southern states, Birx says the two leading states for positive tests are Texas and Arizona. Vice-President Pence echoed President Donald Trump's message that the number of cases had been increasing because testing had been stepped up. Last weekend, the president told a rally in Oklahoma he had asked his team to reduce testing to keep case numbers down. The White House said at the time that Trump was ""in jest"" but the president said on Tuesday: ""I don't kid."" Pence says that while 34 states ""are experiencing stability"", ""we have seen cases rise precipitously across the south"". He adds that while daily new cases had fallen from around 30,000 in April, the number has now risen again (today,the US reached 40,000 new cases for the first time). He says there are 16 states with rises in cases and the percentage of positive results. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Emily Robison (left) and Natalie Maines of The Chicks Country band Dixie Chicks have changed their name to The Chicks, to help highlight racial inequality in the US.

"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing Two Met Police officers have been suspended after ""inappropriate photos"" were taken at the crime scene of a double murder. The unnamed officers were arrested by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on 22 June and have since been bailed. The bodies of sistersBibaa Henry and Nicole Smallmanwere found earlier this month at Fryent Gardens in Wembley. Commander Paul Brogden said he was ""horrified"" by the allegations. He added senior officers from the Met and the IOPC visited the sisters' family to inform them of the serious allegations. ""This deeply disturbing information will no doubt have created additional trauma for a family who are already grieving the devastating loss of two loved ones,"" Commander Brogden said. ""I am horrified and disgusted by the nature of these allegations; a sentiment which will be shared by colleagues throughout the organisation. ""If true, these actions are morally reprehensible and anyone involved will be robustly dealt with."" Ms Smallman, 27, had been with friends celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday at the park on the evening of 5 June. A 36-year-old man arrested in south London on suspicion of murder was released with no further action. Detectives believe the sisters were killed by a stranger who repeatedly stabbed them in the early hours of 6 June - their bodies were not found until the following day. In a statement the Met said two officers from the North East Command unit had both been suspended from duty. Images recovered from their phones - which were found in a pond - showed the sisters dancing with fairy lights hours before they were killed The force said its directorate of professional standards was told last week about allegations that ""non-official and inappropriate photographs"" had been taken at the crime scene. The IOPC said the pictures were allegedly ""shared with a small number of others"", adding the Met was ""handling matters involving those members of the public who may have received those images"". Since their bodies were found forensic officers have been searching a large area of the park including a pond and have trawled through hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rubbish that was accidently cleared from the scene. Detectives believe the killer received injuries in the attack ""which caused significant bleeding"". The IOPC is also separately investigating how the Met handled calls from worried family and friends of the sisters after they went missing.

"A government roadmap for the return of live theatre and music has been met with calls for financial support and a timetable for reopening, with many dismissing the plan as inadequate. The five-step roadmap did not come with dates or monetary help attached. Actors' union Equity said,externalthat without investment to save jobs and venues, such guidance ""will be meaningless"". Birmingham Hippodrome and UK Theatre headFiona Allan said,externalit was ""of no practical benefit"" without a timescale. ""We need dates to work towards in order to plan properly or more jobs will be lost and more venues and companies close,"" she wrote. ""How is this not clear?"" Venues have been shut since March, with many warning that they will go out of business in the coming months without support. Mr Dowden said the roadmap ""provides a clear pathway back"" A government spokesperson said: ""We want to get the performing arts fully back up and running safely as soon as possible and are working closely with the sector on a phased approach, guided by public health and medical experts."" The arts have been supported by loans, grants, the furlough scheme and a Â£160m Arts Council England emergency package, and the government is ""considering ways in which we may be able to support it further on top of the unprecedented financial assistance we have already provided"", the spokesperson said. On Thursday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden published the five-stage plan for a ""phased return"", which will initially let performances take place outdoors, with indoors performances to follow later. Stage One- Rehearsal and training (no audiences and adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Two- Performances for broadcast and recording purposes (adhering to social distancing guidelines) Stage Three- Performances outdoors with an audience plus pilots for indoor performances with a limited distance audience Stage Four- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (but with a limited distanced audience indoors) Stage Five- Performances allowed indoors/outdoors (with a fuller audience indoors) Mr Dowden said he wanted ""to raise the curtain on live performances"" as soon as possible, and that the roadmap ""provides a clear pathway back"".

"This video can not be played Starmer: ""I've made it my first priority to tackle anti-Semitism"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has sacked Rebecca Long-Bailey, saying she shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake. The shadow education secretary - who was beaten to the party leadership by Sir Keir - later said she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. But Sir Keir said his ""first priority"" was tackling anti-Semitism. The Labour leader said: ""The sharing of that article was wrongâ¦ because the article contained anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and I have therefore stood Rebecca Long-Bailey down from the shadow cabinet. ""I've made it my first priority to tackle anti-Semitism and rebuilding trust with the Jewish community is a number one priority for me."" Kuenssberg: Long-Bailey sacking risks reopening internal Labour tensions Starmer launches inquiry into anti-Semitism report Jewish Labour group 'encouraged' by Starmer talks Profile: Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey A spokesman for the Labour leader added: ""Anti-Semitism takes many different forms and it is important that we all are vigilant against it."" In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She said: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Later on Thursday, Ms Peake tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". She added: ""I find racism and anti-Semitism abhorrent and I in no way wished, nor intended, to add fodder to any views of the contrary."" Allow Twitter content?

There are political consequences to Keir Starmer's sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey. On becoming leader, Sir Keir said he wanted to bring unity to the party where previously there have been factional fighting. His decision may re-open divisions, with one former shadow minister on the party's left telling me that this was ""a dangerous moment for the party"" - with the new leader 'purging' those with whom he disagreed. Others in the party note that Sir Keir has done quite a lot in a short space of time to install people close to him in key positions. Leadership sources, though, insist the sacking was not part of some grand plan. They say Mrs Long-Bailey had to go because she repeatedly refused to remove her retweet of Maxine Peake's article when asked to do so. And for Sir Keir, this is all about tackling the toxic perception of anti-Semitism in the Labour party ahead of a potentially damning report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. His allies say he promised actions not words to the Jewish community and he is following through. He wants to make sure that under his leadership he sends out a signal that those who are accused of anti-Semitism have no place at his top table. The new shadow education secretary won't be announced today. Those formerly close to Jeremy Corbyn say that the appointee must come from the left of the party if Labour's leader is concerned about maintaining unity. But he is proving that he won't duck difficult decisions. The Jewish Labour Movement - which has led calls for a crackdown on anti-Semitism in Labour's ranks - welcomed Sir Keir's decision to sack Mrs Long-Bailey. National chairman Mike Katz said: ""We have consistently maintained that the pervasive culture of anti-Semitism, bullying and intimidation can only be tackled by strong and decisive leadership. ""The culture of any organisation is determined by the values and behaviours of those who lead them."" And the Board of Deputies of British Jews President Marie Van der Zyl called Mrs Long-Bailey's initial response ""pathetic"" and thanked the Labour leader for his ""swift action"". But Mrs Long-Bailey's allies on the left of the party have criticised the decision. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who supported her leadership bid, said: ""Throughout discussion of anti-Semitism it's always been said criticism of practices of Israeli state is not anti-Semitic. ""I don't believe therefore that this article is or Rebecca Long-Bailey should've been sacked. I stand in solidarity with her."" Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, whose union supported Mrs Long-Bailey in her leadership bid, said her sacking was ""an unnecessary overreaction to a confected row"". ""Unity is too important to be risked like this,"" he said. The row erupted when Mrs Long-Bailey tweeted ""Maxine Peake is an absolute diamond"" with a link to the article on the Independent website. The Salford and Eccles MP said she had retweeted the article because of Ms Peake's ""significant achievements and because the thrust of her argument is to stay in the Labour Party"" but she did not endorse ""all aspects of it"". After she was sacked, Mrs Long-Bailey said she had issued a clarification of her retweet of the article ""agreed in advance by the Labour Party Leader's Office"". She added that she was ""subsequently instructed to take both this agreed clarification and my original retweet of Maxine Peake's interview down"". ""I could not do this in good conscience without the issuing of a press statement of clarification. ""I had asked to discuss these matters with Keir before agreeing what further action to take, but sadly he had already made his decision."" Rebecca Long-Bailey was a contender in the this year's Labour leadership race along with Lisa Nandy and, eventual winner, Sir Keir Starmer Mrs Long-Bailey became a Labour MP in 2015. She was a supporter of former leader Jeremy Corbyn and was quickly promoted to his frontbench team, serving as shadow chief secretary of the Treasury and later shadow business secretary. Following Labour's defeat in the 2019 election, Mrs Long-Bailey entered the leadership contest to replace Mr Corbyn and was supported by many on the left of the party.

"Emily Robison (left) and Natalie Maines of The Chicks Country band Dixie Chicks have changed their name to The Chicks, to help highlight racial inequality in the US. ""Dixie"" was often used as a nickname for the southern states that made up the Confederate States of America during the US Civil War era. The Texas trio revealed they'd dropped it on Thursday, while unveiling a protest song called March March. They follow in the footsteps of US pop group Lady Antebellum, who changed their name earlier this month. Antebellum has similar connotations with the slavery-era.

"Klopp arrived at Liverpool after seven years at Borussia Dortmund When Jurgen Klopp walked into Anfield for his first day as Liverpool manager on 8 October 2015, there was one keynote message from his public address. ""We must turn from doubters to believers,"" said the charismatic German as he sat in front of the cameras and lights of the world's media. Less than five years on, no-one doubts Klopp or his players. After a remarkable rise from 10th place on his arrival to European champions for the sixth time, they havenow returned to their domestic perch as Premier League champions, too. Liverpool and their manager were forced to wait an extra three months for their coronation as the season was halted by the global coronavirus pandemic but the silverware is reward for his revitalisation of the club and its support. Klopp's public persona is the big man with the tactile approach and the booming laugh. The animated presence in the technical area, celebrating with players and fans. So much more goes on behind the public image - so much more that gives the lie to those who nonsensically claimed Klopp's greatest coaching quality in his early days was as a cheerleader. Behind the scenes, away from the public gaze, his meticulous approach, as well as his intellect for football's modern methods and matters outside the game, make him the towering figure in Liverpool's spectacular revival. The notion that he simply strolls around Melwood smiling and hugging people may sustain those who wish to pour cold water on his brilliant successes, or downplay his tactical shrewdness. The reality could not be more different. 'Absolutely incredible' - Klopp reacts to Liverpool title win Rank the 10 games which have defined Klopp's reign Â£1.47bn spent, 239 players, nine permanent managers - Liverpool's 30-year wait in numbers Klopp believes the training ground is where the difference is made. This is where the drills are run through, where tactical ideas are tried and tested. Bolt onto this some spectacular recruitment and you have the 2019-20 Premier League champions. Every session is meticulously planned with his staff before training. Klopp will then address his players to outline their work in depth. He is not just Liverpool's manager, he is Liverpool's coach. Every aspect of every day is plotted and analysed in minute detail. In preparing for games, he insatiably gathers information before condensing it into the essential and most urgent details. Inside Anfield this is regarded as a key skill that helps drive one of his best qualities - the ability to take big decisions quickly, without prevarication, and getting those decisions right. Klopp - the Black Forest boy who 'became a hero' Klopp himself is the exact model of planning and efficiency he expects of others. He insists on punctuality, on everything operating like clockwork. If a meeting is planned for 10am, 10am it is. His and Liverpool's success is the result of a fiercely driven individual. The hard work of the manager and all those behind him. As he says: ""I live 100% for the boys, with the boys."" There are no gimmicks. No ""Hollywood"" moment was transformative in the story leading to Liverpool's coronation as Premier League champions. Klopp is the leader, strategist and inspiration. But of course there is also a team behind him. Klopp, with his assistants Zeljko Buvac (centre) and Peter Krawietz (right) at Dortmund When the German arrived at Anfield it was inevitable that he would be joined by two of his closest, most trusted allies - Zeljko Buvac and Peter Krawietz. Buvac and Krawietz had been central to Klopp's management team at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund. The trio came as a package wherever he went. Within that structure, the taciturn Bosnian-Serb Buvac was known as ""The Brain"" for his awareness of tactical detail while German Krawietz was ""The Eye"" for his acute analytical skills. But when Buvac's 17-year association with Klopp ended suddenly in April 2018, it led to a new dynamic in Liverpool's coaching set-up - and new levels of success. Klopp, of course, is the leader in all respects, while Krawietz is now joined by Pep Ljinders. The 37-year-old Dutchman had already made a huge impression at Liverpool, having worked at the club as an under-16s coach before being appointed first-team development coach in 2015. Three years later, Ljinders left to take over as manager of NEC Nijmegen in the Netherlands. It proved to be a short stint and when he left, Klopp had no hesitation in bringing him back for the start of the 2018-19 season to fill the gap vacated by Buvac. Both Krawietz and Lijnders are assistant managers. No hierarchy exists and both serve crucial, differing roles within Klopp's team. Krawietz runs a team of four analysts, focusing on all aspects of previous and forthcoming games - a role so integral it shapes training sessions and team selection. He is on the training ground every day. An example of how the Klopp-Krawietz partnership works is seen in messages exchanged by the pair during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. They had homed in on the increasing influence of set-pieces, both defensive and attacking, and a decision was made to be more innovative, especially as Liverpool were now armed with the height of Virgil van Dijk and the delivery of Trent Alexander-Arnold. The facts speak for themselves. Fans at Anfield still celebrate Liverpool's quick corner success against Barcelona in the 2018-19 Champions League In 2017-18, Liverpool scored 13 goals and conceded 12 from set-pieces. Increased focus and innovation following the World Cup saw them score 29 and concede only eight in the subsequent campaign. Such enlightened attention to detail even included the arrival of a dedicated throw-in coach, the Dane Thomas Gronnemark, after the tournament, an appointment designed to eradicate errors and maximise the many re-starts from this position during games. However, Liverpool and Krawietz are not slaves to specifics. He and Klopp still want room for free thinking and spontaneity at set-pieces. What greater example than Trent Alexander-Arnold's quickly taken corner that caught Barcelona cold in last season's Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield? During a normal week at Melwood, Krawietz will usually present Klopp with 90 minutes of analytical detail which will be whittled down over the course of two meetings to a 25-30 minute presentation which the manager will deliver the day before the game. The main aim of the session is that Liverpool's players are made aware of their opponents' strengths. But they also leave the room with greater confidence in their own ability to do damage. Klopp, as ever, takes the final decisions. but the analysis provided by Krawietz has always been crucial. As is the more visible presence of the lively, tactically sharp Lijnders. Lijnders arrived at Liverpool in 2014, when Brendan Rodgers was manager He is a vocal, traditional assistant who takes many training sessions along with Klopp. He is also the buffer between other non-football departments at Liverpool, shaping operational management and drawing up schedules to ensure players get enough rest, deciding when to train and maximising performance. Klopp's confidence in himself and those around him is such that he says: ""I know I'm good at a couple of things and really good at a few things and that's enough. My confidence is big enough that I can really let people grow next to me. That's no problem. I need experts around me."" It is a three-pronged approach that brought almost perfection at various stages over the past two seasons and, to use the words of Brian Clough about Peter Taylor, the goods at the back of the store are almost as essential to the overall package as what is in the shop window. On the pitch, Klopp has earned his reputation alongside the other coaching greats now in the Premier League, such as Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti at Everton and Jose Mourinho at Tottenham. He has also, almost without fail, made players better, whether they were signed by him or already at Liverpool. An emotional Jordan Henderson celebrates winning the Champions League with Klopp moments after the final whistle Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, signed by Kenny Dalglish in June 2011, had his doubters almost up to the time he lifted the Champions League in Madrid last May. Klopp never wavered. Now, Henderson's form and reputation has never been higher. Roberto Firmino is another he inherited. His signing from Hoffenheim in June 2015 initially raised doubts over Liverpool's ""transfer committee"", the group that used to lead buying strategy and was responsible for far more failures than successes. In a previous time, there was justifiable cause to question a muddled transfer policy, especially after theÂ£75m sale of Luis Suarezto Barcelona in summer 2014. The prime example was the folly of subsequently spendingÂ£16m on Mario Balotellifrom AC Milan, shortly after then-manager Brendan Rodgers had insisted publicly: ""I can categorically tell you he will not be coming to Liverpool."" Firmino has now moved into the category of world class under Klopp's tutelage. Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and goalkeeper Alisson - who all had quality on arrival - have become even better for Klopp's work. Mane told BBC Sport: ""He is close to his players and he gives us responsibility on the pitch, which is really important for each player. At the same time he is very friendly with us. That is one of his big strengths."" Since Klopp's arrival, Liverpool's transfer business has become the template for efficiency. This January, before any rivals had made their moves, a Â£7.5m deal for Red Bull Salzburg'sTakumi Minaminowas signed, sealed and delivered for the first day of the month. The same was true of the Â£75m move for Van Dijk from Southampton. Deal announced on 27 December 2017. Deal signed 1 January 2018. And this is down, in large part, to what those behind the scenes at Anfield describe as Liverpool's ""Holy Trinity"". The relationship between Klopp, sporting director Michael Edwards and Mike Gordon, the man with the second biggest equity stake in the club and who could be described as the ""managing owner"". Klopp, Gordon (centre) and Edwards (right) pictured at Liverpool's training ground in December, when Klopp signed a contract extension until 2024 Gordon has the complete trust of principal owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner. While Henry may be the figurehead, Gordon is the most influential owner in many ways because he makes the crucial decisions along with Klopp and Edwards - whether it is a signing, contract renewals or extensions, even down to the recruitment of academy coaches. Gordon has the final sign-off on major projects, such as the Â£60m extension of the Anfield Road Stand to take capacityabove 60,000,and the new Â£50m training facility at Kirkby. But he is not simply the man who signs the cheques. Anfield insiders acknowledge his sharp football brain as well as business acumen. He sees his role as empowering Klopp and Edwards to ensure the football operation flourishes. He has total trust and confidence in their judgement. The three are in constant touch daily, WhatsApp messages fly between all parties. Edwards joined the club as head of analytics in 2011 and was appointed as sporting director in November 2016. In terms of public profile, he remains secretive and elusive, out of the public eye. He believes that helps him do his work under the radar to deliver what Klopp and Liverpool need. Inside Melwood, the story is very different. Edwards is respected and admired, operating an open-door policy and having his own trusted staff such as head of scouting and recruitment Dave Fallows, chief scout Barry Hunter, and Ian Graham, Julian Ward and Dave Woodfine. When Klopp signed a new contract in December, tying him to the club until summer 2024, he said: ""I must highlight the role of our sporting director Michael Edwards in this journey so far. His input and collaboration has been just as important as anyone else's in getting us into a position to compete for the game's top titles."" Edwards has his team. Klopp has his. Gordon empowers and discusses before signing off, and therein lies the method behind Liverpool's brilliant resurgence. One of the classic examples of how this triangle of power works came when, in Hong Kong on a pre-season tour in summer 2017, midfielder Philippe Coutinho effectively told the club that overnight he had become unhappy and wanted to move to Barcelona, who had just sold Neymar to Paris St-Germain. Coutinho, despite his obvious brilliance, was actually regarded by some as a player Liverpool had come to rely on too much. When he did not perform, as in the 2016 Europa League final loss to Sevilla in Basel, the overall team suffered. When the Brazilian duly made his move in January 2018, plans were in place to conclude two of the most important signings in the club's recent history, following up the long-planned pursuit of Van Dijk with the Â£66.8m arrival of Brazil goalkeeper Alisson from Roma in July 2018. Coutinho was not replaced, but acquisitions were made in other areas that pushed Liverpool to their current level. In February 2017, Liverpool had drawn up their list of transfer targets that included the likes of Bayer Leverkusen's Julian Brandt and Christian Pulisic, who was coming to prominence at Borussia Dortmund and is now with Chelsea. The name of Roma's Mohamed Salah lurked elsewhere on Liverpool's radar. Salah was the deal that was done, with Klopp very happy to give much of the credit to the forceful opinions of Edwards that this was a potentially game-changing signing. This cool, analytical, collegiate system is now the envy of Europe's elite clubs and central to the plans that have brought the title back to Anfield after 30 years. Klopp has not simply built for the present. He is taking care of the future. In his first days at Liverpool in October 2015, he was pictured gazing out over the Melwood training grounds with academy director Alex Inglethorpe. This wasn't just a new manager doing the rounds. He was seeing what he had to work with. Klopp is willing to spend big but not with waste, and the development of youngsters such as teenagers Curtis Jones and Neco Williams in FA Cup wins over Everton and Shrewsbury Town - when Klopp entrusted his under-23s while he and the seniors took a winter break - is confirmation of this strategy. He is a firm believer in looking first from within. Liverpool will make the high-profile signings and are in a healthy position to do so, but Klopp knows he has golden reserves. The development of Jones and Williams, and his trust in them, means Liverpool arguably have another Â£50m that can be spent elsewhere. Ben Woodburn and Rhian Brewster were among the players on show as Klopp watched Liverpool Under-18s with Inglethorpe (left) on 10 October 2015 Not that Klopp is a romantic. All decisions are based on hard-headed business reality and if the game-changer is there, Liverpool will be in the hunt. Klopp is frugal but strategic. It is an all-encompassing policy that has renewed Liverpool to the point where they are, in the eyes of many, Europe's finest side with a team and club built in Klopp's image. Former Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre, who sat at Klopp's right hand when he was introduced at Anfield, says: ""Is Jurgen right for Liverpool? The answer is absolutely. ""Everything is natural. Nothing is made up. He doesn't do anything for effect. He is naturally engaging. He raises the energy level in a room when he walks in. ""He is big and imposing. He is a hugger. All these things he does because it is natural to him. He doesn't think 'I'm going to hug the staff and the players'. He does it because he cares for these people. That is who Jurgen Klopp is. He just fits perfectly.""

"The US Treasury department did not check death records before mailing out stimulus cheques The US Treasury mistakenly sent more than $1.4bn (Â£1.1bn) of its pandemic rescue funds to dead people, government inspectors have found. The finding was one of several ""challenges"" uncovered in the official review of federal coronavirus aid. Since March, Congress has pumped some $2.6tn into the American economy in an effort to shield it from virus slowdown. But the rush to deliver the money has contributed to errors, inspectors said. For example, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the Treasury Department, which was in charge of mailing stimulus cheques to American families, did not check death records, even though some of the tax officials working on the programme said they raised concerns about the risk of erroneous mailings. How the pandemic in US compares with rest of world From 'We've shut it down' to 100,000 US dead The report also warned that the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses - a low-cost loan fund that accounts for 26% of US pandemic spending - was at ""significant risk"" of fraud, faulting the Small Business Administration for not cooperating with requests for information about the loans and its plans for oversight. ""Because of the number of loans approved, the speed with which they were processed, and the limited safeguards, there is a significant risk that some fraudulent or inflated applications were approved,"" the inspectors said. It said changes to respond to those risks were ""essential"". The report comes as lawmakers in Washington debate whether or not additional aid is necessary. While Democrats and many economists - including the head of America's central bank - have recommended further relief, pointing to high unemployment, many Republicans have been hesitant to approve more money. ""We should be very, very careful in evaluating what's necessary before we go forward,"" Republican Senator Pat Toomey said at a recent hearing. White House officials have said additional stimulus is likely, but that it makes sense to see how the efforts so far are working. Critics say federal programmes have resisted oversight efforts, however. In April, President Donald Trump removed the official in charge of overseeing coronavirus spending. Congresswoman Nydia VelÃ¡zquez, a Democrat from New York, said the audit had revealed ""mishandling and negligence"" and ""mismanagement of taxpayer funds"". ""If today's report makes one thing clear, it is the need for transparency and accountability,"" she said. ""Administration officials must answer that call."" How muchhasthe USspent on coronavirus? Congress has approved about $2.6tn in pandemic spending since March - a package estimated at about 14% of the country's output. About 11%, or more than $280bn, was intended to be spent on direct payments of up to $1,200 for individuals earning less than $75,000 and $500 for children. The US has sent 160.4 million pandemic payments worth a total of $269bn so far, according to the report. The single largest chunk of the rescue funding - about 26% - was for small business loans through the Paycheck Protection Program. The US has distributed more than $500bn in loans to 4.6 million businesses so far. America's $349bn fund for small firms runs out Which country has the most generous bailout? Critics have said the distribution of those funds has been bungled by unclear rules and lack of oversight, claims supported by the GAO report. ""Consistent with the urgency of responding to serious and widespread health issues and economic disruptions, agencies have given priority to moving swiftly where possible to distribute funds and implement new programs,"" it said. ""As trade-offs were made, however, agencies have made only limited progress so far in achieving transparency and accountability goals."" Which country has the most generous bailout?
