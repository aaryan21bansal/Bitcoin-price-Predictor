"The partner at PwC who signed off on the accounts of BHS has been banned from the profession for 15 years. Steve Denison admitted misconduct over the 2014 audit of BHS and the Taveta Group, which controls Topshop. In 2015 Mr Denison signed off the BHS accounts as a going concern, just days before it was sold for Â£1. BHS collapsed in 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. As well as banning Mr Denison, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) fined him Â£325,000 and PwC Â£6.5m. The FRC said both had admitted ""misconduct"". PwC said there were ""serious shortcomings with this audit work"". ""We are sorry that our work fell well below the professional standards expected of us and that we demand of ourselves,"" the company said. ""At its core this is not a failure in our audit methodology, the methodology simply was not followed."" It said that the audit failings ""did not contribute to the collapse of BHS"". PwC added that it had overhauled its monitoring procedures. Mr Denison left the audit firm this month after nearly 33 years there. The failure of BHS was the biggest collapse in the British retail industry since the demise of Woolworths in 2008. It prompted intense scrutiny. Politicians investigated how Sir Philip Green had been able to sell the business, with a large pension deficit, to a company run by Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no retail experience. BHS's pension deficit had ballooned to Â£571m by the time the retailer went into administration in April 2016. Last year, Sir Philip paid Â£363m to BHS's pension schemes.

"The red squirrel has been put on the first ""red list"" for UK wild mammals The red squirrel, the wildcat, and the grey long-eared bat are all facing severe threats to their survival, according to new research. They are among 12 species that have been put on the first ""red list"" for wild mammals in Britain. The Mammal Society and Natural England study said almost one in five British mammals was at risk of extinction. Factors such as climate change, loss of habitat, use of pesticides and disease are to blame, the report said. It said the hedgehog and water vole have seen their populations decline by almost 70% over the past 20 years. However, it is good news for the otter, pine marten, polecat and badger, which have all seen their populations and geographical range spread. The report is described as the first comprehensive review of the population of British mammals for 20 years. Researchers examined more than 1.5m individual biological records of 58 species of terrestrial mammal. They looked at whether their numbers were going up or down, the extent of their range, if there were any trends, and what their future prospects were. The species have been ranked using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria, which is used to compile the global list of threatened species. The wildcat is among the species that are threatened, the study said A species that makes it on to the ""red list"" means it is called ""threatened"" and it faces becoming extinct within the next decade. The highest threat category is ""critically endangered."" Three species were given this status: the wildcat, the greater mouse-eared bat, and the black rat. The next highest threat level is ""endangered"". Listed here is the red squirrel, along with the beaver, water vole and grey long-eared bat. The third-highest threat category is ""vulnerable"". The hedgehog, the hazel dormouse, Orkney vole, serotine bat and barbastelle bat are included in this list. What are the most endangered animals in the world? Animals' popularity 'a disadvantage' 'Shocking' impact on protected areas Prof Fiona Mathews, chairwoman of the Mammal Society said: ""This is the first time anyone has looked across all species for about 20 years. ""Now obviously we're living in a country that's changing enormously - we're building new homes, new roads, new railways, agriculture's changing - so it's really important we have up to date information so we can plan how we're going to conserve British wildlife."" John Gurnell, emeritus professor of ecology at Queen Mary University of London said the study was important. ""It's the first time since the 90s that we've assessed the status of all 58 species of terrestrial mammal in Great Britain,"" he said. ""I think it provides us a launching pad for going forward in working out what to do in trying to conserve species in the country where necessary."" Climate change and loss of habitat are among the factors to blame for the threat to species including the grey long-eared bat The species reported as increasing in number were the otter, pine marten, polecat and badger along with red and roe deer, the greater and lesser horseshoe bat, and beaver and wild boar. Prof Mathews called it a ""mixed picture"". ""Some species are doing well, so carnivores, for example, like polecats and pine martens, they seem to be bouncing back,"" she said. ""Probably because they're not being persecuted in the way that they were in the past.

"Darren Gledhill was jailed at Bradford Crown Court for 28 months A gambling addict who stole more than Â£430,000 from his grandmother to fund his habit has been jailed. Darren Gledhill, 30, plundered his elderly gran's life savings over three years, leaving her three children with no inheritance following her death. Bradford Crown Court heard he began stealing from Sandra Gledhill after he set up an online bank account for her. Jailing him for 28 months, Judge Durham Hall QC said the emotional distress he had caused was ""beyond calculation"". Yorkshire breaking news: RNLI stands by Whitby 'porn' probe suspensions; new arrest over fatal Barnsley stabbing The court heard Gledhill, who worked as a manager for Sainsbury's, stole amounts ranging from Â£1.20 to Â£10,200 by transferring the money in to his own account. The offence came to light when the care home where his grandmother was living realised she was more than Â£40,000 in arrears. When police checked her bank accounts they found Gledhill had made 350 bank transfers between June 2014 and November 2017. Prosecutor Philip Adams said the money should have gone to Mrs Gledhill's three surviving children following her death in January. Abigail Langford, for Gledhill, said he had been in the grips of an online gambling addiction. She said: ""He was clearly in the grip of a downward spiral of depression at the time of the commission of these offences, sadly unrecognised by him."" ""He will never be able to repay the money he took. ""It causes him great distress now in the cold light of day."" Judge Durham Hall QC said: ""You were a prodigious gambler and I suspect, as there is nothing left, a prodigious loser."" Gledhill, of Hebble Gardens, Halifax, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft.

"Daniel Petrocelli, lead attorney for AT&T and Time Warner, speaks with the media outside the U.S. District Court on June 12, 2018 in Washington, DC. A US district court judge has cleared the merger of telecoms giant AT&T and media firm Time Warner, in a major defeat for government regulators. The US had sued to block the deal, arguing that it would reduce competition in pay TV and lead to higher prices for consumers. But Judge Richard Leon rejected those arguments, approving the deal without conditions. The ruling is expected to lead to other mergers and acquisitions. The lawsuit against AT&T had sent a signal that the Trump administration's Department of Justice was taking a more hardline stance on such mega-deals. Analysts say the decision will bolster firms such as Comcast - which is considering bidding for 21st Century Fox assets, including its stake in Sky, in a challenge to a deal announced between Fox and Disney last year. Comcast in 'advanced stages' of 21st Century Fox bid Sky takeover battle looms after Hancock clears Fox bid Judge Leon's decision comes more than 18 months after AT&T announced in 2016 its plans to buy Time Warner in a transaction then valued at about $85bn. The deal is set to unite AT&T's significant wireless, satellite television and internet business with Time Warner's media properties, which include HBO and CNN. Attorney Daniel Petrocelli, who represented AT&T, said the firm expects to complete the transaction before 21 June. ""We're disappointed that it took 18 months to get here, but we are relieved that it's finally behind us,"" he told reporters after the decision. US Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said he was disappointed by the decision The case comes as the growth of online firms like Amazon and Netflix have scrambled traditional lines of competition, spurring consolidation and prompting concerns about monopolies. Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? AT&T said the acquisition would give it access to content and advertising heft that would help it compete with online streaming firms, which have led to declines in pay-TV subscribers. Government lawyers had argued that the takeover would hurt innovation and allow AT&T to charge rival providers more for its must-have content - costs that would ultimately be passed on to consumers. During the trial, they urged the court to block the deal or require the sale of certain businesses as a condition of approval. Judge Leon said the US failed to prove the merger would give Time Warner increased power to negotiate fees for its content. He added that the evidence presented at trial showed the deal would probably reduce prices for AT&T customers, without leading to greater costs for subscribers of other services. Judge Leon also said it would be ""unjust"" for the Justice Department to seek to put a hold on the deal pending an appeal. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said the Justice Department was ""disappointed"" by the decision, but did not say if it planned to appeal. ""We continue to believe that the pay-TV market will be less competitive and less innovative as a result of the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner,"" he said in a statement. ""We will closely review the Court's opinion and consider next steps in light of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American consumers."" AT&T boss Randall Stephenson and Time Warner boss Jeffrey Bewkes (R) at a conference in California in 2016 The AT&T lawsuit is the first time in decades that a government challenge of a ""vertical merger"" - involving two companies that do not directly compete - has gone to court. Open Markets Institute, an activist think tank that opposes corporate consolidation, said the ruling was a ""big loss for the public"" and would lead to an effective duopoly for TV distribution. AT&T had initially sought to argue that the government's opposition was fuelled by political objections from US President Donald Trump, who criticised the takeover during the 2016 election campaign. Judge Leon rejected that argument earlier this year. After the decision, Mr Petrocelli said: ""We were surprised when the case was brought and as I said in closing arguments, it's a case that never should have been brought.""

"This video can not be played Arron Banks laughs off the idea he is an ""evil genius with a white cat controlling the whole of western democracy"" Arron Banks has told MPs probing ""fake news"" his Brexit campaign had sometimes ""led people up the garden path"". But he said politicians were also guilty of spin and claimed Parliament was the ""biggest source of fake news"". The tycoon, who spent more than Â£6m on Leave.EU, said he had faced ""absurd"" claims of Russian conspiracies. Media committee chairman Damian Collins said it was ""difficult to know"" whether to take his evidence - and that of colleague Andy Wigmore - seriously. Leave.EU donor 'must explain Russia link' Arron Banks refuses to appear before MPs Facebook: Russian Brexit meddling 'minimal' Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. It ran a ""disruptive"" campaign instead, Mr Banks told the committee, adding: ""We were not above using alternative methods to punch home our message or lead people up the garden path if we had to."" Mr Wigmore, Leave.EU's director of communications, said ""the piece of advice that we got, right from the beginning, was remember referendums are not about facts, it's about emotion and you have got to tap into that emotion"". He said the campaign had aimed to ""make fun"" of journalists and his role in it had been that of an ""agent provocateur"". Asked what the difference was between provocation and lies, he said: ""If you are trying to sell something or put a good case over to somebody you will tell the best story. If that's provocation - or a lie, if you want to call it that, yeah."" Bristol-based insurance tycoon who was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms One of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU and UKIP Born in Cheshire, the twice married father-of-five was a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage A Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at working class voters angry about EU immigration Mr Banks used his appearance before the Commons media select committee to hit back at claims he was involved in a conspiracy with Russian officials, saying there was ""not one shred of evidence"" for it. He was ""not an evil genius with a white cat controlling... western democracy"", he told the committee, accusing its members of being ""Remainers"" with a ""vested interested in trying to discredit the Leave campaign"". He then went on to attack the credibility of Brittany Kaiser and Chris Wylie, whistleblowers who had previously given evidence to the committee about controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica. He dismissed Cambridge Analytica as an ""advertising agency"" that ""did a little bit of politics on the side"". ""We had two or three meetings with them and it became clear to me that - as is true in a lot of politics - there is a lot of sizzle and sometimes not a lot of substance,"" he said. He also addressed revelations at the weekend that he had had two more meetings with the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko than he had previously disclosed in his book on the referendum battle, The Bad Boys of Brexit. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage spoke at a Trump campaign rally in August 2016 The last of these was in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks, Mr Wigmore and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met Mr Trump in New York following his presidential election victory. According to details of emails reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer, Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia including a proposal involving six gold mines. Mr Banks attempted to laugh off suggestions of a conspiracy over his meetings with Mr Yakovenko, telling MPs: ""I was hoping for a good lunch and that is what I did gain from it."" He added: ""The only thing we gave in the second meeting was the telephone number of the (Trump) transition team because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team."" He said Leave.EU had ""briefed the American security services on everything that transpired"". Mr Collins and his committee is looking into fake news in elections Mr Banks denied he was in Moscow in February 2016, as claimed by the Sunday Times, and produced passports containing Russian visas which he said proved he had been in Moscow twice in recent years, in March 2015 and October 2014. Mr Wigmore said he had first sought a meeting with Russian officials at a UKIP conference in his role as a then diplomat for Belize, a small central American nation and former British colony. ""His (Mr Banks') wife is also Russian. We thought it would be nice,"" he told MPs. Mr Wigmore said he had spoken to the ambassador about possible Russian investments in a banana farm in Belize and a port, owned by a bank belonging to former Conservative deputy-chairman and donor Lord Ashcroft. Mr Wigmore said the meeting with Mr Trump had not been planned and only came about because the US President's adviser Kellyanne Conway had asked if they ""wanted to go and see the boss"" when they were in Trump Tower, in New York. He claimed he gave the Trump transition team the phone number of Number 10 Downing Street, because the team had ""no relationship"" with the British government. Mr Banks - who was grilled by MPs for nearly three hours - refused to answer a final set of questions from Labour MP Ian Lucas, saying the session had overrun and he had a lunch appointment to go to. Mr Wigmore had kicked off the session by calling on Mr Collins to stand aside as chairman because he accepted hospitality from ""Putin's number one man in the United Kingdom"" and might be ""conflicted"". Mr Collins recorded a trip to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his register of member's interests. He called the suggestion a ""nice try"" adding ""you might have better intelligence than me... I didn't know that Roman Abramovich was Putin's number one man in London"". In a statement after the hearing, Mr Collins said: ""Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand. ""So it is difficult for the Committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high ranking Russian officials."" He said his inquiry would be writing to the pair to follow up some of the points they had made, adding: ""Our inquiry is about getting to the truth of these matters.""

"Protests have been held in both Greece and Macedonia against a compromise on the name of the former Yugoslav republic Greece has reached a deal on the name of its northern neighbour, which called itself Macedonia at the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. After 27 years of talks - and many protests - they have settled on the formal name of Republic of North Macedonia. Greece had objected to the name Macedonia, fearing territorial claims on its eponymous northern region. It had vetoed the neighbour's bid to join Nato and the European Union. The new name will now need to be approved by the Macedonian people and Greek parliament. Under the deal, the country known at the United Nations as Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom) will be named Republic of North Macedonia. Its language will be Macedonian and its people known as Macedonians (citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia). Significantly, they agreed that the new name would be used both internationally and bilaterally, so that even the 140 or more countries that recognise the name Macedonia will also have to adopt North Macedonia. In Macedonian, the name is Severna Makedonija. Greece country profile Macedonia country profile They also agreed that the English name could be used as well as the Slavic term. Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev gave details of the deal in a live address from the capital Skopje The two sides had earlier dropped a number of alternatives, including Gorna Makedonija (Upper Macedonia), Nova Makedonija (New Macedonia) and Ilinden Macedonia. The name Macedonia already belongs to a northern region of Greece that includes the country's second city Thessaloniki. By adopting the name in 1991, the new nation infuriated many Greeks, who suspected their northern neighbour of territorial ambitions. The new state of Macedonia did not help matters when it named the main airport in its capital, Skopje, after Ancient Greek hero Alexander the Great, as well as a key motorway running from the Serbian to the Greek border. During the 4th Century BC, the Macedonia of Alexander and his father Philip II before him ruled all of Greece and much beyond it. The M word: Why the row over Macedonia's name runs so deep Only partly.Greece argues that Macedonia is an intrinsic part of Hellenic heritage,external. The ancient capital of Aigai is close to the modern Greek town of Vergina, while Alexander's birthplace is in Pella. As part of the deal, it is made clear that the people of North Macedonia have no relation to ancient Greek civilisation and their language is part of the Slavic family, unrelated to ancient Greek heritage. Alexander-era tomb was found in Greece But while Alexander remains a powerful symbol, recent territorial disputes over Macedonia are far more serious. Alexander the Great ruled over Greece and created a vast empire in the ancient world When the Ottomans were driven out of the broad region known as Macedonia during the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, it was split up, mainly between Greece and Serbia, but a small part went to Bulgaria. In World War Two, Greek and Yugoslav Macedonia were occupied by Bulgaria, an ally of Nazi Germany and Italy. Communists from both Yugoslavia and Bulgaria played a part in the Greek civil war that followed, so memories are still raw. When Yugoslavia broke up, Greece would only accept the new country as ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom)"" at the UN, even though much of the world came to recognise it as Macedonia. The makeover that's divided a nation The man who has focused on one word for 23 years A new mood has emerged between the governments to put an end to the dispute. Macedonia's government set the stage for a deal earlier this year when it renamed its airport ""International airport Skopje"" and the Alexander the Great motorway is now simply ""Friendship"" (Prijatelstvo in Macedonian). There is also a push for a settlement both from the EU and Nato which some have put down to fears of creeping Russian influence in the Balkans. Greece is the main obstacle to Macedonia joining Nato. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Macedonia's Zoran Zaev met on the sidelines of an EU summit in Bulgaria last month, prompting reports that a deal was close. Then they had a long phone-call on Monday and followed it up with another conversation on Tuesday. Mr Tsipras then gave details of the deal to the Greek president and then Mr Zaev went on live TV in Macedonia, hailing the agreement as historic and adding: ""There is no way back."" Mr Tsipras gave a live address a little later, speaking of ""a great diplomatic victory but also a great historic opportunity"". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg praised the two prime ministers for their ""willingness"" to solve the dispute. The text is expected to be signed on Saturday on the shores of Lake Prespa, which spans the countries' borders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The aim is to get Macedonia's parliament to back an agreement before EU leaders meet for a summit on 28 June. Greece will then send a letter to the EU withdrawing its objection to accession talks and a letter to Nato too. That will be followed by a Macedonian referendum in September or October. If Macedonian voters back the deal, their government will then have to change the constitution, a key Greek demand. The deal will finally have to be ratified by the Greek parliament. That may not be straightforward. Greeks are generally opposed to any name that includes Macedonia and some political parties are unlikely to back this. On 13 June, the parties are expected to get a copy of the 20-page deal to examine before announcing their stance. Mr Tsipras insists that he has maintained all of Greece's ""red lines"" - but the document is likely to be leaked by those who oppose it. Large protests against a deal were held in some 25 Greek cities earlier this month, from Pella to Thessaloniki. When big crowds descended on the centres of Athens and Thessaloniki in February, renowned Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, 92, said the neighbouring northern state was illegitimate. ""Macedonia was, is and will forever be Greek,"" he insisted. A lot can happen over a long, hot summer. Delays may hamper the planned timescale and there could be repercussions for both leaders. Mr Tsipras and Mr Zaev will have to face down opposition within their own countries as well as beyond. A nationalist party, Independent Greeks, may refuse to back the deal, but it is unlikely to put at risk a ruling coalition that it is part of. Matthew Nimetz has spent more time on the name issue in two decades of shuttle diplomacy than anyone else Although the two prime ministers have taken control of the issue, United Nations mediator Matthew Nimetz will likely be called upon to sort out any problems. Since 1994, this US diplomat has quietly shuttled between Athens and Skopje searching for common ground that would eventually lead to a deal. It is difficult to see how another deal could work.

"Oscar-winner Robert De Niro swore at the president during Sunday night's Tony Awards US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Hollywood actor Robert De Niro after the star denounced him with an expletive-laden speech at an awards ceremony. De Niro, who has previously said he would like to punch the president, received a standing ovation for his verbal attack at the Tony Awards.

The Oscar-winning actor has starred in a number of boxing films, including Raging Bull, and he pulled no punches during the live television broadcast of Sunday night's Tony Awards. Before introducing a performance from Bruce Springsteen, De Niro used the f-word in reference to Donald Trump a number of times, which were bleeped out by the CBS network broadcasting the ceremony. Addressing Bruce Springsteen, De Niro said: ""Even more important in these perilous times, you rock the vote. Always fighting for, in your own words, truth, transparency and integrity in government. Boy do we need that now."" His comments garnered a huge amount of reaction on social media. De Niro offered refuge from Trump Trump's year on Twitter The actor has long been a vocal critic of the president. He released a video during the 2016 election campaign in which he railed against Mr Trump, calling him ""an idiot"" and a ""national disaster"". He said he would move to Italy if Mr Trump was elected, and the town where his great-grandparents lived offered him ""refuge"" when this happened. ""I'm going to probably have to move there,"" De Niro joked on the day of the result. This video can not be played Meryl Streep criticised Donald Trump and defended Hollywood, foreigners and the press This is not the first time Mr Trump has responded to a Hollywood star attacking him during a speech. Last year, Meryl Streep strongly criticised him at the Golden Globes and said his actions legitimised bullying.

"Tesla's Model 3 is crucial to the company's profitability Tesla said it plans to cut 9% of its workforce as part of a restructuring intended to reduce costs and boost profitability. The job cuts at Elon Musk's electric car maker come as it tries to increase production of its Model 3 sedan and turn a quarterly profit this year. Tesla said the more than 3,000 cuts would affect mostly salaried employees and not those making its cars. Mr Musk said the move had been a ""difficult decision"". Tesla employed more than 37,000 people at the end of last year. ""Given that Tesla has never made an annual profit in the almost 15 years since we have existed, profit is obviously not what motivates us,"" he wrote in an email to employees and posted on Twitter. ""What drives us is our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable, clean energy, but we will never achieve that mission unless we can eventually demonstrate that we can be sustainably profitable.""

Musk: No 'bonehead' questions please Last month Mr Musk said the company was planning a wide-ranging reorganisation that would flatten its management structure. In the email, he said the cuts are aimed at eliminating duplicate roles and he does not expect them to affect the firm's production ability. Tesla employees based at US DIY chain Home Depot and involved with the home solar business Tesla acquired when it bought SolarCity are among those affected, he said. The ""majority"" of those workers will be offered positions in Tesla's retail business, Mr Musk added. Michelle Krebs, an Autotrader analyst, said the job cuts were not a surprise. ""It is clear that Tesla is under tremendous pressure to finally turn a profit and is attempting to address it by cutting overhead,"" she said. ""Also notable is Tesla is not cutting production jobs at a time when pushing Model 3s out the door is a top priority."" Elon Musk: No 'bonehead' questions please Is Tesla heading for trouble?

"(Top L-R) Haji Khan, Assad Hussain, Alladitta Yousaf (Bottom L-R) Khalid Hussain, Moinul Islam, Kameer Iqbal Six men from Oxford who groomed and sexually abused teenage girls between 1998 and 2005 have been jailed. Assad Hussain, 37, of Iffley Road, will serve a life sentence with a minimum term of 12 years for multiple rapes. Judge Peter Ross said victims were brought into the group, who were convicted of more than 20 offences, through flattery, drugs and alcohol. Oxford Crown Court heard they were also subjected to threats and violence, and made to have sex with other men around. Hussain was described as using one victim as a ""sexual object"". Judge Ross said Moinul Islam, of Wykeham Crescent, who was jailed for 15 years and nine months, had a child ""completely at his mercy"". In his summing up he said sexual abuse had become ""the norm"" for the men. The NSPCC said the victims, aged between 13 and 15, ""would not be silenced"" despite a ""campaign of  fear and violence"" from the men.

"Leo Varadkar was addressing concerns about surgical abortions raised in the Dail (parliament). Irish hospitals with a Catholic ethos will be expected to carry out abortions when new laws on terminations come into effect, the Irish prime minister has said. Leo Varadkar said doctors, nurses or midwives could opt out of performing procedures on conscience grounds. However, entire institutions will not have that option. Mr Varadkar was addressing concerns about surgical abortions raised in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). Seismic shift for Ireland Timeline: Ireland and abortion It follows alandslide vote in favour of repealing the Republic of Ireland's constitutional ban on abortionin May. The government is drafting legislation that will allow for any woman to request an abortion up to 12 weeks, subject to a cooling off period, and will allow abortion in extreme cases between 12 and 24 weeks. The taoiseach said the legislation would follow the model of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which allowed for terminations in extreme medical circumstances, and allow individual medics to opt out. ""It will not, however, be possible for publicly-funded hospitals, no matter who their patron or owner is, to opt out of providing these necessary services which will be legal in this state once this legislation is passed by the DÃ¡il and Seanad (senate),"" he added. ""I'm happy to give you that assurance."" Mr Varadkar added: ""That legislation will allow individuals to opt out based on their consciences or their religious convictions but will not allow institutions to do so. ""So, just as is the case now in the legislation for the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, hospitals like for example Holles Street, which is a Catholic voluntary ethos hospital, the Mater, St Vincent's and others will be required, and will be expected to, carry out any procedure that is legal in this state and that is the model we will follow.""

"This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? The Pentagon has reassured allies of its ""ironclad"" security commitments, after President Donald Trump cancelled its Korean military exercises. Mr Trump made the announcement after Tuesday's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore. The move is seen as a big concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise. Meanwhile, North Korean state media said Mr Kim had accepted an offer from President Trump to visit the US. KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had invited Mr Trump to visit Pyongyang ""at a convenient time"" and Mr Trump had also invited Mr Kim to the United States. ""The two top leaders gladly accepted each other's invitation,"" KCNA added. In his first reported comments since the talks, Mr Kim said it was ""urgent"" to halt ""irritating and hostile military actions against each other"". He said the two countries ""should commit themselves to refraining from antagonising"" each other ""and take legal and institutional steps to guarantee it"", KCNA reported. How the summit unfolded Kim is a 'funny guy' - analysing Trump's quotes How many dead US soldiers are in North Korea? The US and South Korea hold regular joint live-fire exercises The Kim-Trump summit - the first such meeting between the two countries - centred on nuclear disarmament and reducing regional tensions. It concluded with a one-page agreement. In the press conference afterwards, however, Mr Trump added another announcement: the cancellation of the military exercises. The drills, often called ""war games"", are held in South Korea with local forces and US soldiers stationed there. Mr Trump also said he wanted to bring US troops home - although he did not specify a timeframe. He said the drills were ""provocative"" - even though the US has previously defended them - and there were suggestions that US allies had not been forewarned of this move. South Korea's Presidential Blue House said it needed ""to find out the precise meaning or intentions"" of Mr Trump's statement. South Korean President Moon Jae-in spoke by phone with Mr Trump for 20 minutes late on Tuesday, but an official readout of the call made no mention of military exercises, according to Reuters. The previous day US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters he did not believe that troop levels were on the agenda. When asked if he would know if such discussions were planned, he said, ""Yeah, I sure would."" There are thousands of US soldiers in South Korea However, the Pentagon has since denied that Mr Mattis was caught off guard. He was consulted ahead of time, said Pentagon spokesperson Dana White. In a statement sent to the BBC, she said: ""Our alliances remain ironclad, and ensure peace and stability in the region."" In a flurry of tweets later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said there was ""no limit"" to what North Korea could achieve if it gave up its nuclear weapons. He thanked Mr Kim for ""taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people"" and said the world had taken ""a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe"".

The US maintains around 30,000 troops in South Korea and once a year it brings in others - typically from its Pacific base in Guam - to join large-scale drills. Full text of the signed statement Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments North Korea sees the annual exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, but the government in Seoul maintains they are defensive in nature. Mr Trump said scrapping them will save a ""tremendous amount of money"", but he added that they could be reinstated if co-operation from the North declines. The summit began with a handshake, unimaginable just months ago. Mr Trump and Mr Kim - who traded vicious insults last year - gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures After a one-on-one meeting, followed by wider talks with advisers and a working lunch, they presented their agreement. It said the two countries would co-operate towards ""new relations"", while the US would provide ""security guarantees"" to North Korea. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Kim also ""reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". This video can not be played Trump: ""The past does not have to define our future"" Observers say the document lacks substance, in particular on how denuclearisation would be achieved. However, speaking to reporters after, Mr Trump said: Mr Kim had agreed to denuclearisation being ""verified"", a key US demand ahead of the meeting Mr Trump said Mr Kim had also agreed to destroy a ""major missile engine testing site"" But he said sanctions would remain in place for now and argued ""we haven't given up anything"". Several reporters asked whether Mr Trump had raised the issue of human rights with Mr Kim, who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced-labour camps. Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector How many dead US soldiers in N Korea? Who was Trump's nuclear uncle? The US president said he had, and repeated his description of Mr Kim as ""talented"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Two years ago Barack Obama travelled to Cuba - and was roundly denounced by conservatives for breaking bread with totalitarian leaders and praised by liberals for his statesmanship. Now, with Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un, the tables have been turned. Mostly. On conservative Fox News and among Mr Trump's core supporters, the president was lauded for a historic diplomatic breakthrough. Among Democrats, there was more than a fair amount of concern that the president was engaging in a glorified publicity stunt with little chance of success. South Korean newspapers reporting the Trump-Kim summit Republicans in Congress have been more measured. There was plenty of talk of ""historic first steps"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words, but concern over how the yet-to-be negotiated verification details will turn out. A few other conservatives expressed dismay at seeing the US and North Korean flags side-by-side, and viewed Mr Trump's solicitous manner and warm words for Mr Kim as too much, given his nation's history of human rights violations. ""Needless to say, we would've wrecked Obama for doing this,"" tweeted conservative blogger Allahpundit. Tuesday was the latest reminder that in just 16 months, US - and international - politics have been turned upside down. Trump Kim summit: Win-win or a Kim win?

"US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have finally shaken hands. But nobody knew exactly how it would play out.  Here we break down the images from an extraordinary morning to explain how each moment unfolded. The last finishing touches were made to the red carpet at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island with North Korean and US flags seen as a bold backdrop. It's safe to say that there has rarely if ever been a time when the North Korean and American flags flew side-by-side quite like this. It's a symbolic win for Kim, showing both players come together on equal terms. What you don't see in the picture is the media swarm on the other side of the photo, poised for that historic handshake. Almost as if they had rehearsed this moment, Mr Trump entered from the right and Mr Kim from the left. Trump and Kim make history with a handshake North Korea crisis in 300 words The three things North Korea wants Even before the two leaders were anywhere near each other, you can already see Mr Trump stretching out his hand - ready perhaps, to execute that famous grip he's known for. ""Nice to meet you Mr President,"" were the words spoken by Mr Kim upon meeting Mr Trump. It was a firm handshake of equals pressed upon each other, but one that was significantly shorter than Mr Trump is used to, lasting only seconds instead of the uncomfortably long ones the US leader usually gives. On Mr Kim's part, the handshake is a lot less dramatic than the one the North Korean leader gave South Korean President Moon Jae-in just a month ago, where he gripped Mr Moon's hand and led him over to the North Korean side of the border. And then Mr Trump ushers Mr Kim off the red carpet. He's seen in many pictures physically guiding or moving Mr Kim along, projecting an image that he's in charge and in control. ""Donald Trump placing his hand on Kim's back...[this] shows a bit of dominance,"" Manoj Vasudevan, a body language expert told BBC World News. ""You can see Trump leads the way a lot."" The duo are seen here in a fireside chat setting before they made their way into their one-on-one meeting. The moment, as it played out, was slightly awkward, with Mr Kim seen staring at the ground and Mr Trump fidgeting with his hands. Unlike the South Korean summit there was no scheduled ritual, it was almost a series of staged tableaux. ""Here they are sitting together, [but they aren't] making much eye contact,"" says Mr Vasudevan. ""You can see Kim Jong-un changing his position a few times and Trump tapping his fingers, [a sign of being] uncomfortable. There's no outward appearance of close rapport."" The awkwardness is understandable. Here's Mr Trump and Mr Kim walking (with Mr Trump one step ahead) towards their one-on-one meeting which lasted for 40 minutes. For Mr Trump, he's likely to credit any success in these talks to his ""maximum pressure campaign"". For Mr Kim, gaining an audience with a sitting US leader could be seen as a victory in itself - something which neither his father or grandfather could achieve. More importantly, it's cemented his legitimacy as a world leader. How the outcast became popular 'Stop romanticising a dictator' Human rights: What Trump and Kim won't talk about Both at the end of the bilateral talks and when the leaders gave a joint statement to the press, they shook hands again - a number of times. Without a clear sense of what exactly they have agreed to, perhaps gestures of goodwill summed up the day best. Reporting by the BBC's Yvette Tan.

"This video can not be played Was the summit a win-win for both countries, or a Kim win? The handshake has happened, the summit is over, and now Donald Trump is hitting the media circuit - including his first sit-down interview with a major news network other than Fox - to make the case for what he has accomplished. Because it's Mr Trump, some of what he has to say is head-scratching, other parts will have his supporters smirking or swooning, while many of his critics will be outraged. Here are a few of his key lines - and what they could mean. ""He's got a great personality. He's a funny guy. He's very smart. He's a great negotiator. He loves his people, not that I'm surprised by that."" This was Mr Trump's response when Voice of America's Greta Van Susteren asked what he found surprising about the North Korean leader. He would alsotell ABC's George Stephanopoulos,externalthat the North Korean people love him back and that they have ""great fervour"" for their leader. That the US president says he was not surprised that Mr Kim, who oversees a totalitarian regime that imprisons an estimated 120,000 of its people for political reasons, ""loves his people"" or that they love him will certainly come as a shock to many human rights advocates. In fact, the pageantry of the summit, Mr Trump's solicitous manner and his kind words for Mr Kim have already drawn the ire of some of the president's critics - and others who have, in the past, largely held their tongue. 'A missed chance' says defector The summit's oddest moments Did rhetoric match reality? Handshake moment explained in pictures ""I think the North Korean flag is a piece of vile filth that stands for the dynastic rule of a racist cult that subjugates, tortures and enslaves its own people,""writes National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg,external, regarding the display of US and North Korean flags at the summit site. ""Ideally it would spontaneously combust when it even touches our flag."" TheNational Rifle Association's Dana Loesch said,externalshe was ""not a fan"" of having the US and North Korean flags together, ""as any sort of equals"". Several reporters pressed Mr Trump on North Korea's record of human rights violations - and whether the president, who described Mr Kim as ""talented"", should have been more cautious with his language. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough - I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it - he ran it,"" Mr Trump said in reply to a question about his praise of Mr Kim. ""Very few people, at that age - you can take one out of 10,000, probably, could do it."" That ""talented"" line provoked a response from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. ""This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done."" Donald Trump, in his press conference, announced that Mr Kim had ""reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". He had also agreed to ""vigorous"" negotiations to implement the agreement. Agreements and negotiations have happened in fits and starts for nearly three decades, of course. Mr Trump sees a different outcome because he sees himself differently. He's the consummate dealmaker. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures ""My whole life has been deals,"" he told reporters. ""I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't."" Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised his predecessors, saying that they didn't get the job done - but he campaigned on the promise that he would be a different kind of president and would get a different, better result. It's a view he's not backing away from. ""I think he trusts me, and I trust him."" During the US-Soviet arms disarmament negotiations of the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan coined the phrase ""trust but verify"". On multiple occasions on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he trusts Mr Kim - and Stephanopoulos brought the Reagan line up during his interview with the president. Mr Trump responded that the US and North Korea would be working together and developing ""great relationships at different levels"". As for the details? The ""trust"" has been professed, but the ""verify"" is yet to be spelled out. ""If I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honour to do it."" One of the prime lines of criticisms directed at Mr Trump for participating in the summit is that he is encouraging other rogue regimes to develop their own nuclear weapons so that they can stand on equal footing with a US president. Mr Trump has shredded an agreement with Iran that was designed to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear arsenal. It is an ""honour"", on the other hand, for the president to deal with Mr Kim, a ""very powerful man"" who has ""powerful nuclear weapons"". Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who has largely supported the Trump administration, makes the distinction clear. ""Countries like Iran and Cuba and other two-bit rogue regimes don't have nuclear weapons yet,""he told,externalradio host Hugh Hewitt. ""They can't threaten the United States in that way. Once North Korea had nuclear weapons, once they have missiles that can deliver them to use, I would liken it to past presidents sitting down with Soviet dictators."" Nuclear weapons got North Korea to the table. The big question now is what it will take for the US to convince Mr Kim to give them up. ""I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it, and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing, I think without that we wouldn't be here."" It was just under one year ago that Mr Trump warned North Korea that its threats against the US would be met by ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"". He'd go on, over the course of the following months, to deride Mr Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and disparage the size of his ""nuclear button"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance Lines like those had pundits, politicians and analysts expressing shock and concern that the US was on a path to war - and inside reports from the White House of military deliberations and planning did nothing to ease minds. Now Mr Trump is saying that it was all part of his strategy - a modern-day incarnation of Richard Nixon's ""madman"" gambit with the North Vietnamese - which he says may have made him look ""foolish"" but has proven to be effective. ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should."" This nugget was nestled at the beginning of the question-and-answer portion of Mr Trump's post-summit press conference - and it represents a significant concession on the part of the US side. Even using the term ""war games"" itself comes across as a nod to the North Koreans. Annual US-South Korea joint military training exercises had been a constant source of irritation for the North, which viewed the operations as preparation for war. Mr Trump is ending them - at least for the moment - and perhaps most noteworthy is that he couched the revelation as a cost-saving step. That may play well with Mr Trump's base, who rallied around Mr Trump's campaign pledge to spend US resources at home, not abroad - although it does mark a change of tack from the president's boasts of record level of military spending in the latest US budget for a depleted US armed forces. ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things.  I may be wrong.  I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.'  I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."" This line - a president admitting that he may not admit to mistakes - raised more than a few eyebrows, but it's part of what makes Mr Trump so irresistible to his supporters. They thoroughly believe that all politicians lie, that they all will never admit mistakes, that they all say whatever they think voters want to hear. Mr Trump, at least in their estimation, is being open about it. He is, in effect, letting them in on the joke. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe the negotiations will fall apart. Maybe Mr Trump will find some sort of excuse. But, if that happens, he'll do it with a wink and a nod to those who have stood by him through it all.

"North Korea's beaches could represent a new business opportunity, according to Mr Trump US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore was a historic event, marking the first time that current heads of the two countries have met. From the historic handshake between the two leaders to the signing of a joint agreement, experts have analysed the meeting and its significance for future US-North Korean relations. But there were some odd moments of the day, which have got people talking. Before he became president, Donald Trump was better known for his property empire. But it was still a surprising moment to hear the US leader mention a lesser known North Korean attraction: its coastline. ""They (North Korea) have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, 'Boy look at that view. Wouldn't that make a great condo?',"" he told reporters after meeting Mr Kim. North Korea: surfer's paradise? The US government currently advises against all travel to North Korea and says that its citizens who decide to go should draft a will before departure. Before the two leaders sat down for a working lunch, Mr Trump jokingly asked photographers: ""Getting a good picture, everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin?"" However, his words seem to have been lost in translation, judging by Mr Kim's blank expression. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Before the US president gave a news conference, journalists were treated to a highly unusual four-minute video in Korean and English, which Mr Trump said he had shown to Mr Kim.

Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen?... Which path will be chosen?

"Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said the UK government was showing ""contempt"" for devolution The Scottish government says its wants changes to the devolution settlement following the failure to reach a deal over the EU Withdrawal Bill. MPs have been debating changes to the Brexit bill as ministers seek to reverse defeats in the House of Lords. Holyrood has not given its consent to the bill - but there was little time for MPs to discuss its concerns. Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said devolution was ""being treated with contempt by the UK government"". He said the Scottish government would be looking at ways to ""find a new arrangement"" for the relationship between the Scottish and UK parliaments. And he said that ""we can't carry on with devolution as it is now"". Scottish Secretary David Mundell said he was ""very disappointed"" by the lack of devolved consent, but insisted that ""the bill can prevail without it"". Live: MPs debate changes to EU Withdrawal Bill Ministers win Brexit vote after concession Minister quits government over Brexit MPs are debating the EU Withdrawal Bill, the UK government's flagship piece of Brexit legislation, across two marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. The governmentsaw off a move to give MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexitif they do not agree with the deal it negotiates, winning the key vote by 324 to 298. The concession offered by ministers is believed to include offering a new parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers. Devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, but there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the fact there was no time to properly debate the bill's impact on devolution ""rubs insult into injury"". Anti-Brexit campaigners staged a demonstration at Westminster as MPs debated the bill inside MSPs voted by a margin of 93 to 30 torefuse consent for the Brexit legislation last month, with Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems backing the SNP in the final vote. It followeda lengthy rowbetween the Scottish and UK governments about how powers coming back from Brussels after Brexit will be used. Changes have been made to the bill to reflect a deal struck between the UK and Welsh governments, but Mr Russell says these do not go far enough. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on Sunday urging him to let MPs ""properly"" debate devolved consent. But with the UK government seeking to overturn many of the15 defeatsthey suffered as the Withdrawal Bill passed through the House of Lords, there was ultimately little time for discussion of devolution. This will be the first time since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999 that Westminster will have legislated across a devolved matter without the consent of MSPs. Mr Russell told BBC Scotland that ""this is not the way the UK is meant to operate"", and warned that the Scottish government would be seeking a new way of working. He said: ""The reality is that we can't carry on with devolution as it is now, because devolution is being treated with contempt by the UK government. ""All the systems that are meant to work are clearly of no importance to them. So over the next few weeks we'll be looking at ways in which we can say, look, we've got to find a new arrangement here because this present arrangement does not work."" David Mundell said there was still scope for a deal between Scottish and UK ministers Asked what Scottish ministers could do going forward, Mr Russell suggested that they might not cooperate with the UK government in future Brexit matters. He said: ""There are many options, but what I want to do is look at the way in which for example clause 11 orders - these ways in which the UK government is going to impose their will on Scotland - will go forward. ""I cannot imagine that we would want to cooperate on those in areas which are unsuitable for the Scottish Parliament."" Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney also said it was unacceptable that more time had not been set aside to discuss the impact of the Brexit bill on devolution. Mr Mundell said he was ""very disappointed"" that an agreement could not be reached over devolved consent, but said the bill could still proceed. He said: ""We talked about it right up to the last minute, but we're just not in agreement on the interpretation of our constitution. ""What we've got is the constitutional settlement that people voted for in the 2014 referendum. People in Scotland accepted the settlement. ""The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon don't accept the current settlement - they want independence, so I can understand why they don't like the arrangement. But it is in accordance with the constitution as we have it, so the bill will proceed."" Mr Mundell said a deal was still possible, ""even at this late hour"", adding: ""We won't be power-grabbing, we won't be overriding the Scottish Parliament, we'll be seeking their consent on all the matters this bill relates to."" Months of talks between the two governments have failed to reach an agreement The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.

"Intervening to make an offer: it looks as though the government concessions appealed to the rebels Maybe it was the moment when the former education secretary, Justine Greening, intervened on her former ministerial colleague, Dominic Grieve, that the government realised the game was up. She was so supportive towards the former attorney general, as he argued for Parliament to have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of the Brexit deal, that it seemed probable she would join the Euro-rebels in voting for itâ¦. For some time the government Chief Whip Julian Smith had been flitting round the Chamber talking to his troops - then he went and had a word with the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, the government's in-house legal eagle, who is dealing with the techie legal aspects of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Soon after, Mr Buckland intervened on Mr Grieve to suggest talks over a compromise deal. It appeared that the head count had been done, and the concession followed. Most dangerous The meaningful vote is probably themost dangerous of the Lords amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill,external- because it tees up an unpredictable vote on the final terms of Brexit, towards the end of this year, and opens up the possibility that MPs could demand that ministers change policy, in the event the terms were rejected by the House, or no deal was reached in the talks with the EUâ¦.. they could even demand (drumroll) a second referendumâ¦ The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. As I write the full terms of the deal have yet to be revealed, but there is briefing ministers have conceded that a motion, which could be amended, would be put before MPs, in event a final divorce deal is voted down. In other words, in the event of a divorce deal that the Commons refused to accept, MPs would be able to set a new course for Brexit. This whole idea was denounced by Brexiteers as a Trojan horse for Remainers, and for a second referendum, so that concession could well produce some blowback. But for now, the government seems to have prevented an embarrassing defeat, and the Tory rebels have avoided the unpleasantness of colluding in the defeat of their Prime Minister. One of the leading Tory rebels has told the BBC ""the government has bent not broken"" but it leaves the ""fight for another day"". But ministers now know that a narrow but decisive Commons majority can be assembled against them on critical Brexit issues, and that its next outing could well be on a more substantive vote on a customs union.

"This video can not be played Was the summit a win-win for both countries, or a Kim win? The handshake has happened, the summit is over, and now Donald Trump is hitting the media circuit - including his first sit-down interview with a major news network other than Fox - to make the case for what he has accomplished. Because it's Mr Trump, some of what he has to say is head-scratching, other parts will have his supporters smirking or swooning, while many of his critics will be outraged. Here are a few of his key lines - and what they could mean. ""He's got a great personality. He's a funny guy. He's very smart. He's a great negotiator. He loves his people, not that I'm surprised by that."" This was Mr Trump's response when Voice of America's Greta Van Susteren asked what he found surprising about the North Korean leader. He would alsotell ABC's George Stephanopoulos,externalthat the North Korean people love him back and that they have ""great fervour"" for their leader. That the US president says he was not surprised that Mr Kim, who oversees a totalitarian regime that imprisons an estimated 120,000 of its people for political reasons, ""loves his people"" or that they love him will certainly come as a shock to many human rights advocates. In fact, the pageantry of the summit, Mr Trump's solicitous manner and his kind words for Mr Kim have already drawn the ire of some of the president's critics - and others who have, in the past, largely held their tongue. 'A missed chance' says defector The summit's oddest moments Did rhetoric match reality? Handshake moment explained in pictures ""I think the North Korean flag is a piece of vile filth that stands for the dynastic rule of a racist cult that subjugates, tortures and enslaves its own people,""writes National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg,external, regarding the display of US and North Korean flags at the summit site. ""Ideally it would spontaneously combust when it even touches our flag."" TheNational Rifle Association's Dana Loesch said,externalshe was ""not a fan"" of having the US and North Korean flags together, ""as any sort of equals"". Several reporters pressed Mr Trump on North Korea's record of human rights violations - and whether the president, who described Mr Kim as ""talented"", should have been more cautious with his language. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough - I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it - he ran it,"" Mr Trump said in reply to a question about his praise of Mr Kim. ""Very few people, at that age - you can take one out of 10,000, probably, could do it."" That ""talented"" line provoked a response from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. ""This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done."" Donald Trump, in his press conference, announced that Mr Kim had ""reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". He had also agreed to ""vigorous"" negotiations to implement the agreement. Agreements and negotiations have happened in fits and starts for nearly three decades, of course. Mr Trump sees a different outcome because he sees himself differently. He's the consummate dealmaker. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures ""My whole life has been deals,"" he told reporters. ""I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't."" Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised his predecessors, saying that they didn't get the job done - but he campaigned on the promise that he would be a different kind of president and would get a different, better result. It's a view he's not backing away from. ""I think he trusts me, and I trust him."" During the US-Soviet arms disarmament negotiations of the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan coined the phrase ""trust but verify"". On multiple occasions on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he trusts Mr Kim - and Stephanopoulos brought the Reagan line up during his interview with the president. Mr Trump responded that the US and North Korea would be working together and developing ""great relationships at different levels"". As for the details? The ""trust"" has been professed, but the ""verify"" is yet to be spelled out. ""If I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honour to do it."" One of the prime lines of criticisms directed at Mr Trump for participating in the summit is that he is encouraging other rogue regimes to develop their own nuclear weapons so that they can stand on equal footing with a US president. Mr Trump has shredded an agreement with Iran that was designed to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear arsenal. It is an ""honour"", on the other hand, for the president to deal with Mr Kim, a ""very powerful man"" who has ""powerful nuclear weapons"". Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who has largely supported the Trump administration, makes the distinction clear. ""Countries like Iran and Cuba and other two-bit rogue regimes don't have nuclear weapons yet,""he told,externalradio host Hugh Hewitt. ""They can't threaten the United States in that way. Once North Korea had nuclear weapons, once they have missiles that can deliver them to use, I would liken it to past presidents sitting down with Soviet dictators."" Nuclear weapons got North Korea to the table. The big question now is what it will take for the US to convince Mr Kim to give them up. ""I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it, and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing, I think without that we wouldn't be here."" It was just under one year ago that Mr Trump warned North Korea that its threats against the US would be met by ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"". He'd go on, over the course of the following months, to deride Mr Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and disparage the size of his ""nuclear button"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance Lines like those had pundits, politicians and analysts expressing shock and concern that the US was on a path to war - and inside reports from the White House of military deliberations and planning did nothing to ease minds. Now Mr Trump is saying that it was all part of his strategy - a modern-day incarnation of Richard Nixon's ""madman"" gambit with the North Vietnamese - which he says may have made him look ""foolish"" but has proven to be effective. ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should."" This nugget was nestled at the beginning of the question-and-answer portion of Mr Trump's post-summit press conference - and it represents a significant concession on the part of the US side. Even using the term ""war games"" itself comes across as a nod to the North Koreans. Annual US-South Korea joint military training exercises had been a constant source of irritation for the North, which viewed the operations as preparation for war. Mr Trump is ending them - at least for the moment - and perhaps most noteworthy is that he couched the revelation as a cost-saving step. That may play well with Mr Trump's base, who rallied around Mr Trump's campaign pledge to spend US resources at home, not abroad - although it does mark a change of tack from the president's boasts of record level of military spending in the latest US budget for a depleted US armed forces. ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things.  I may be wrong.  I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.'  I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."" This line - a president admitting that he may not admit to mistakes - raised more than a few eyebrows, but it's part of what makes Mr Trump so irresistible to his supporters. They thoroughly believe that all politicians lie, that they all will never admit mistakes, that they all say whatever they think voters want to hear. Mr Trump, at least in their estimation, is being open about it. He is, in effect, letting them in on the joke. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe the negotiations will fall apart. Maybe Mr Trump will find some sort of excuse. But, if that happens, he'll do it with a wink and a nod to those who have stood by him through it all.

"North Korea's beaches could represent a new business opportunity, according to Mr Trump US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore was a historic event, marking the first time that current heads of the two countries have met. From the historic handshake between the two leaders to the signing of a joint agreement, experts have analysed the meeting and its significance for future US-North Korean relations. But there were some odd moments of the day, which have got people talking. Before he became president, Donald Trump was better known for his property empire. But it was still a surprising moment to hear the US leader mention a lesser known North Korean attraction: its coastline. ""They (North Korea) have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, 'Boy look at that view. Wouldn't that make a great condo?',"" he told reporters after meeting Mr Kim. North Korea: surfer's paradise? The US government currently advises against all travel to North Korea and says that its citizens who decide to go should draft a will before departure. Before the two leaders sat down for a working lunch, Mr Trump jokingly asked photographers: ""Getting a good picture, everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin?"" However, his words seem to have been lost in translation, judging by Mr Kim's blank expression. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some of the dishes on the menu raised eyebrows, even among Koreans. Before the US president gave a news conference, journalists were treated to a highly unusual four-minute video in Korean and English, which Mr Trump said he had shown to Mr Kim. On a background of tense music and strong images, a dramatic narrator asked: ""Will this leader choose to advance his country... Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen?... Which path will be chosen? ""Featuring President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-un in a meeting to remake history, to shine in the sun. One moment, one choice. The future remains to be written."" Allow Twitter content?

The pen bearing Trump's signature was inspected by a North Korean aide, but was later swapped for another But at the last moment,Mr Kim's influential sister Kim Yo-jongswitched the North Korean leader's pen for a ballpoint pen. Security for the North Korean leader has been high throughout the trip, but it is unclear whether the pens were swapped for security or political reasons.

Former basketball star Dennis Rodman,who has visited North Korea five times and twice took part in Mr Trump's Celebrity Apprentice, was visibly overwhelmed as he spoke about the meeting between the two leaders.

"This video can not be played Arron Banks laughs off the idea he is an ""evil genius with a white cat controlling the whole of western democracy"" Arron Banks has told MPs probing ""fake news"" his Brexit campaign had sometimes ""led people up the garden path"". But he said politicians were also guilty of spin and claimed Parliament was the ""biggest source of fake news"". The tycoon, who spent more than Â£6m on Leave.EU, said he had faced ""absurd"" claims of Russian conspiracies. Media committee chairman Damian Collins said it was ""difficult to know"" whether to take his evidence - and that of colleague Andy Wigmore - seriously. Leave.EU donor 'must explain Russia link' Arron Banks refuses to appear before MPs Facebook: Russian Brexit meddling 'minimal' Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. It ran a ""disruptive"" campaign instead, Mr Banks told the committee, adding: ""We were not above using alternative methods to punch home our message or lead people up the garden path if we had to."" Mr Wigmore, Leave.EU's director of communications, said ""the piece of advice that we got, right from the beginning, was remember referendums are not about facts, it's about emotion and you have got to tap into that emotion"". He said the campaign had aimed to ""make fun"" of journalists and his role in it had been that of an ""agent provocateur"". Asked what the difference was between provocation and lies, he said: ""If you are trying to sell something or put a good case over to somebody you will tell the best story. If that's provocation - or a lie, if you want to call it that, yeah."" Bristol-based insurance tycoon who was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms One of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU and UKIP Born in Cheshire, the twice married father-of-five was a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage A Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at working class voters angry about EU immigration Mr Banks used his appearance before the Commons media select committee to hit back at claims he was involved in a conspiracy with Russian officials, saying there was ""not one shred of evidence"" for it. He was ""not an evil genius with a white cat controlling... western democracy"", he told the committee, accusing its members of being ""Remainers"" with a ""vested interested in trying to discredit the Leave campaign"". He then went on to attack the credibility of Brittany Kaiser and Chris Wylie, whistleblowers who had previously given evidence to the committee about controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica. He dismissed Cambridge Analytica as an ""advertising agency"" that ""did a little bit of politics on the side"". ""We had two or three meetings with them and it became clear to me that - as is true in a lot of politics - there is a lot of sizzle and sometimes not a lot of substance,"" he said. He also addressed revelations at the weekend that he had had two more meetings with the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko than he had previously disclosed in his book on the referendum battle, The Bad Boys of Brexit. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage spoke at a Trump campaign rally in August 2016 The last of these was in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks, Mr Wigmore and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met Mr Trump in New York following his presidential election victory. According to details of emails reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer, Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia including a proposal involving six gold mines. Mr Banks attempted to laugh off suggestions of a conspiracy over his meetings with Mr Yakovenko, telling MPs: ""I was hoping for a good lunch and that is what I did gain from it."" He added: ""The only thing we gave in the second meeting was the telephone number of the (Trump) transition team because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team."" He said Leave.EU had ""briefed the American security services on everything that transpired"". Mr Collins and his committee is looking into fake news in elections Mr Banks denied he was in Moscow in February 2016, as claimed by the Sunday Times, and produced passports containing Russian visas which he said proved he had been in Moscow twice in recent years, in March 2015 and October 2014. Mr Wigmore said he had first sought a meeting with Russian officials at a UKIP conference in his role as a then diplomat for Belize, a small central American nation and former British colony. ""His (Mr Banks') wife is also Russian. We thought it would be nice,"" he told MPs. Mr Wigmore said he had spoken to the ambassador about possible Russian investments in a banana farm in Belize and a port, owned by a bank belonging to former Conservative deputy-chairman and donor Lord Ashcroft. Mr Wigmore said the meeting with Mr Trump had not been planned and only came about because the US President's adviser Kellyanne Conway had asked if they ""wanted to go and see the boss"" when they were in Trump Tower, in New York. He claimed he gave the Trump transition team the phone number of Number 10 Downing Street, because the team had ""no relationship"" with the British government. Mr Banks - who was grilled by MPs for nearly three hours - refused to answer a final set of questions from Labour MP Ian Lucas, saying the session had overrun and he had a lunch appointment to go to. Mr Wigmore had kicked off the session by calling on Mr Collins to stand aside as chairman because he accepted hospitality from ""Putin's number one man in the United Kingdom"" and might be ""conflicted"". Mr Collins recorded a trip to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his register of member's interests. He called the suggestion a ""nice try"" adding ""you might have better intelligence than me... I didn't know that Roman Abramovich was Putin's number one man in London"". In a statement after the hearing, Mr Collins said: ""Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand. ""So it is difficult for the Committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high ranking Russian officials."" He said his inquiry would be writing to the pair to follow up some of the points they had made, adding: ""Our inquiry is about getting to the truth of these matters.""

"Bode Miller with daughter Emmy in February last year. The skiing world has been expressing its sympathy The 19-month-old daughter of former US Olympic skier Bode Miller has died after falling into a swimming pool. Emmy Miller was found unconscious at a neighbour's home in Orange County, southern California, and doctors were unable to revive her. In a statement posted on Instagram, Mr Miller said he and his family were ""beyond devastated"". Mr Miller is the most successful skier in US history, with six Olympic medals including gold at the 2010 Games. The 40-year-old and his wife Morgan, a professional beach volleyball player, were at a party on Saturday night when the incident happened. Their daughter somehow got away and was found in the pool by Mrs Miller,who jumped in and tried to resuscitate her, local authorities told ABC,external. Paramedics took the baby girl to hospital but could not save her. ""Never in a million years did we think we would experience a pain like this.

"Thousands of barristers have voted to end industrial action over fees, which has disrupted court cases in England and Wales. They accepted a Â£15m Ministry of Justice offer to raise payment rates for reading documents in trials. More than 3,000 barristers voted in the Criminal Bar Association ballot. The government welcomed the result, but the association warned that ""anger and disillusionment"" remained, adding ""the criminal bar is not going to be quiet"". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said it was ""the right outcome for all - not least victims, witnesses and anyone encountering the criminal justice system."" The Â£15m will go to the Advocates' Graduated Fee Scheme - the public pay pot for barristers doing criminal legal aid defence work. More than half of the new funding will be for fraud, drug and child sex cases which tend to be complex and evidence-heavy. The offer was accepted with 51.5% of lawyers in favour and 48.45% against. Analysis by home affairs correspondent June Kelly Barristers on strike has always been an unusual headline. That was how their action, which began this spring, was reported. This dispute with the government affected a murder trial at the country's most famous criminal court. There was no barrister to represent the accused. The Criminal Bar Association said their action was in response to ""an underfunded justice system which was in chaos.""  The Ministry of Justice described the disruption as unacceptable. The turnout in this ballot over an improved offer from the Ministry of Justice was high at 85%. The vote to accept was slim. The Criminal Bar Association is stressing that the narrow acceptance of the Â£15 million offer underlines barristers' continuing anger. It says the figure represents a 5% increase which does not offset a 40% cut over the previous decade. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, described the outcome of the ballot as ""neither a defeat nor a victory"". The ""anger and disillusionment"" remained, she said, and the association was launching a campaign to ""improve the lot of prosecutors"". She said: ""This proposal is the beginning and not the end of our campaign to improve the broken system we all work in every day."" She added: ""The Criminal Bar has faced degradation and despair and it still does. This is a step forward. We must all ensure we do not take any more steps back."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the government had ""worked closely with the Bar throughout this process and listened carefully to their [criminal advocates'] concerns."" ""We understand the strength of feeling that remains and are committed to working with the sector to support and strengthen the profession, making it fit for the modern age and accessible to those who seek to join it.""

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them.

They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

To get that America and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”, his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"This video can not be played Was the summit a win-win for both countries, or a Kim win? The handshake has happened, the summit is over, and now Donald Trump is hitting the media circuit - including his first sit-down interview with a major news network other than Fox - to make the case for what he has accomplished. Because it's Mr Trump, some of what he has to say is head-scratching, other parts will have his supporters smirking or swooning, while many of his critics will be outraged. Here are a few of his key lines - and what they could mean. ""He's got a great personality. He's a funny guy. He's very smart. He's a great negotiator. He loves his people, not that I'm surprised by that."" This was Mr Trump's response when Voice of America's Greta Van Susteren asked what he found surprising about the North Korean leader. He would alsotell ABC's George Stephanopoulos,externalthat the North Korean people love him back and that they have ""great fervour"" for their leader. That the US president says he was not surprised that Mr Kim, who oversees a totalitarian regime that imprisons an estimated 120,000 of its people for political reasons, ""loves his people"" or that they love him will certainly come as a shock to many human rights advocates. In fact, the pageantry of the summit, Mr Trump's solicitous manner and his kind words for Mr Kim have already drawn the ire of some of the president's critics - and others who have, in the past, largely held their tongue. 'A missed chance' says defector The summit's oddest moments Did rhetoric match reality? Handshake moment explained in pictures ""I think the North Korean flag is a piece of vile filth that stands for the dynastic rule of a racist cult that subjugates, tortures and enslaves its own people,""writes National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg,external, regarding the display of US and North Korean flags at the summit site. ""Ideally it would spontaneously combust when it even touches our flag."" TheNational Rifle Association's Dana Loesch said,externalshe was ""not a fan"" of having the US and North Korean flags together, ""as any sort of equals"". Several reporters pressed Mr Trump on North Korea's record of human rights violations - and whether the president, who described Mr Kim as ""talented"", should have been more cautious with his language. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough - I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it - he ran it,"" Mr Trump said in reply to a question about his praise of Mr Kim. ""Very few people, at that age - you can take one out of 10,000, probably, could do it."" That ""talented"" line provoked a response from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. ""This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done."" Donald Trump, in his press conference, announced that Mr Kim had ""reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". He had also agreed to ""vigorous"" negotiations to implement the agreement. Agreements and negotiations have happened in fits and starts for nearly three decades, of course. Mr Trump sees a different outcome because he sees himself differently. He's the consummate dealmaker. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures ""My whole life has been deals,"" he told reporters. ""I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't."" Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised his predecessors, saying that they didn't get the job done - but he campaigned on the promise that he would be a different kind of president and would get a different, better result. It's a view he's not backing away from. ""I think he trusts me, and I trust him."" During the US-Soviet arms disarmament negotiations of the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan coined the phrase ""trust but verify"". On multiple occasions on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he trusts Mr Kim - and Stephanopoulos brought the Reagan line up during his interview with the president. Mr Trump responded that the US and North Korea would be working together and developing ""great relationships at different levels"". As for the details? The ""trust"" has been professed, but the ""verify"" is yet to be spelled out. ""If I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honour to do it."" One of the prime lines of criticisms directed at Mr Trump for participating in the summit is that he is encouraging other rogue regimes to develop their own nuclear weapons so that they can stand on equal footing with a US president. Mr Trump has shredded an agreement with Iran that was designed to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear arsenal. It is an ""honour"", on the other hand, for the president to deal with Mr Kim, a ""very powerful man"" who has ""powerful nuclear weapons"". Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who has largely supported the Trump administration, makes the distinction clear. ""Countries like Iran and Cuba and other two-bit rogue regimes don't have nuclear weapons yet,""he told,externalradio host Hugh Hewitt. ""They can't threaten the United States in that way. Once North Korea had nuclear weapons, once they have missiles that can deliver them to use, I would liken it to past presidents sitting down with Soviet dictators."" Nuclear weapons got North Korea to the table. The big question now is what it will take for the US to convince Mr Kim to give them up. ""I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it, and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing, I think without that we wouldn't be here."" It was just under one year ago that Mr Trump warned North Korea that its threats against the US would be met by ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"". He'd go on, over the course of the following months, to deride Mr Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and disparage the size of his ""nuclear button"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance Lines like those had pundits, politicians and analysts expressing shock and concern that the US was on a path to war - and inside reports from the White House of military deliberations and planning did nothing to ease minds. Now Mr Trump is saying that it was all part of his strategy - a modern-day incarnation of Richard Nixon's ""madman"" gambit with the North Vietnamese - which he says may have made him look ""foolish"" but has proven to be effective. ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should."" This nugget was nestled at the beginning of the question-and-answer portion of Mr Trump's post-summit press conference - and it represents a significant concession on the part of the US side. Even using the term ""war games"" itself comes across as a nod to the North Koreans. Annual US-South Korea joint military training exercises had been a constant source of irritation for the North, which viewed the operations as preparation for war. Mr Trump is ending them - at least for the moment - and perhaps most noteworthy is that he couched the revelation as a cost-saving step. That may play well with Mr Trump's base, who rallied around Mr Trump's campaign pledge to spend US resources at home, not abroad - although it does mark a change of tack from the president's boasts of record level of military spending in the latest US budget for a depleted US armed forces. ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things.  I may be wrong.  I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.'  I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."" This line - a president admitting that he may not admit to mistakes - raised more than a few eyebrows, but it's part of what makes Mr Trump so irresistible to his supporters. They thoroughly believe that all politicians lie, that they all will never admit mistakes, that they all say whatever they think voters want to hear. Mr Trump, at least in their estimation, is being open about it. He is, in effect, letting them in on the joke. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe the negotiations will fall apart. Maybe Mr Trump will find some sort of excuse. But, if that happens, he'll do it with a wink and a nod to those who have stood by him through it all.

"This video can not be played James Murray spoke to BBC Radio 5 live. The father of a University of Bristol student who took his own life wants data protection rules changed to prevent further deaths at universities. Ben Murray, 19, died in May and was the 10th Bristol student to take their life in the last two years. His father James Murray is now calling for the rules to be relaxed so parents can be told if students are struggling. The university said it was considering an ""opt-in"" for next of kin to be told of a ""major concern about wellbeing"". The teenager, who was studying English, was described as having a ""brilliant mind"". He achieved straight As at GCSE, enjoyed sports and was ""loved by all his friends and family""- who had no idea he was suffering from anxiety - his father said. ""Ben told us at the end of the first term at Bristol University he was enjoying himself and to all intents and purposes he seemed to be having a good time,"" Mr Murray toldBBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster. The teenager was described as having a ""brilliant mind"" with ""everything in front of him"" But on the morning of his death, he met his father for lunch and spoke of ""bottling up his feelings and thoughts"". ""It was a lovely lunch. He started by saying he'd wished he'd been more open which at the time seemed like he was opening up about his thoughts and feelings,"" his father said. ""But there was no sign at all - nothing at all."" It was only after his death the family discovered Ben had been falling behind in his studies, missing lectures and was days away from ""being removed from the university"". ""He was carrying a lot of pain and anxiety for six months and wasn't telling us what was going on,"" Mr Murray said. ""Now the more questions you ask, the more opportunities you see for intervention and the more distressed you become."" Mr Murray said the university had ""been very open"" with the family since their son's death but had followed the data privacy rules while he was studying there. ""Having gone through all the different moments when we could have intervened to save our son's life, it's absolute nonsense that you would look at an issue and say: 'You're an adult therefore data privacy applies',"" he said. ""Data privacy that may cause the vulnerable to lose their lives makes no sense at all."" It was only after Ben's death his family discovered he had been falling behind in his studies The university's plans include implementing an ""opt-in"" which would ""enable contact with nominated next of kin"" over wellbeing concerns Mr Murray is calling for the rules to be relaxed or changed to ""allow universities to communicate more openly"" and wants tutors to be more accountable for wellbeing, as well as academic success. ""Tutors are the front line in terms of dealing with students,"" he said. ""They have the first early warning signs of something being wrong so they need to be held accountable."" In a statement, Bristol University said student mental health and wellbeing was the ""single biggest challenge the higher education sector faces"". ""As a university we are taking every step we can, working with our students, staff, and health partners to ensure our community is as safe and supportive as we can possibly make it,"" it said. ""Our vice-chancellor has met with Ben's father and we are actively working with his, and other parents, as part of our plans to create a structure of preventative services and policies that avoids our students reaching crisis point. ""This includes implementing an 'opt-in' contract with our students which would enable contact with nominated next of kin if we had a major concern about their wellbeing.""

"Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said the UK government was showing ""contempt"" for devolution The Scottish government says its wants changes to the devolution settlement following the failure to reach a deal over the EU Withdrawal Bill. MPs have been debating changes to the Brexit bill as ministers seek to reverse defeats in the House of Lords. Holyrood has not given its consent to the bill - but there was little time for MPs to discuss its concerns. Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell said devolution was ""being treated with contempt by the UK government"". He said the Scottish government would be looking at ways to ""find a new arrangement"" for the relationship between the Scottish and UK parliaments. And he said that ""we can't carry on with devolution as it is now"". Scottish Secretary David Mundell said he was ""very disappointed"" by the lack of devolved consent, but insisted that ""the bill can prevail without it"". Live: MPs debate changes to EU Withdrawal Bill Ministers win Brexit vote after concession Minister quits government over Brexit MPs are debating the EU Withdrawal Bill, the UK government's flagship piece of Brexit legislation, across two marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. The governmentsaw off a move to give MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexitif they do not agree with the deal it negotiates, winning the key vote by 324 to 298. The concession offered by ministers is believed to include offering a new parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers. Devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, but there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the fact there was no time to properly debate the bill's impact on devolution ""rubs insult into injury"". Anti-Brexit campaigners staged a demonstration at Westminster as MPs debated the bill inside MSPs voted by a margin of 93 to 30 torefuse consent for the Brexit legislation last month, with Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems backing the SNP in the final vote. It followeda lengthy rowbetween the Scottish and UK governments about how powers coming back from Brussels after Brexit will be used. Changes have been made to the bill to reflect a deal struck between the UK and Welsh governments, but Mr Russell says these do not go far enough. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on Sunday urging him to let MPs ""properly"" debate devolved consent. But with the UK government seeking to overturn many of the15 defeatsthey suffered as the Withdrawal Bill passed through the House of Lords, there was ultimately little time for discussion of devolution. This will be the first time since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999 that Westminster will have legislated across a devolved matter without the consent of MSPs. Mr Russell told BBC Scotland that ""this is not the way the UK is meant to operate"", and warned that the Scottish government would be seeking a new way of working. He said: ""The reality is that we can't carry on with devolution as it is now, because devolution is being treated with contempt by the UK government. ""All the systems that are meant to work are clearly of no importance to them. So over the next few weeks we'll be looking at ways in which we can say, look, we've got to find a new arrangement here because this present arrangement does not work."" David Mundell said there was still scope for a deal between Scottish and UK ministers Asked what Scottish ministers could do going forward, Mr Russell suggested that they might not cooperate with the UK government in future Brexit matters. He said: ""There are many options, but what I want to do is look at the way in which for example clause 11 orders - these ways in which the UK government is going to impose their will on Scotland - will go forward. ""I cannot imagine that we would want to cooperate on those in areas which are unsuitable for the Scottish Parliament."" Scottish Labour MP Paul Sweeney also said it was unacceptable that more time had not been set aside to discuss the impact of the Brexit bill on devolution. Mr Mundell said he was ""very disappointed"" that an agreement could not be reached over devolved consent, but said the bill could still proceed. He said: ""We talked about it right up to the last minute, but we're just not in agreement on the interpretation of our constitution. ""What we've got is the constitutional settlement that people voted for in the 2014 referendum. People in Scotland accepted the settlement. ""The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon don't accept the current settlement - they want independence, so I can understand why they don't like the arrangement. But it is in accordance with the constitution as we have it, so the bill will proceed."" Mr Mundell said a deal was still possible, ""even at this late hour"", adding: ""We won't be power-grabbing, we won't be overriding the Scottish Parliament, we'll be seeking their consent on all the matters this bill relates to."" Months of talks between the two governments have failed to reach an agreement The Brexit bill says that the ""vast majority"" of the 158 areas where policy in devolved areas is currently decided in Brussels will go directly to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments after Brexit. But it has also named 24 areas where it wants to retain power temporarily in the wake of Britain's exit from the EU, including in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement. It says the ""temporary restriction"" on the devolved governments using some of the powers returning from the EU is needed ""to help ensure an orderly departure from EU law"" and allow the same rule and regulations to remain in place across the whole of the UK. But the Scottish government argues that it would leave Holyrood unable to pass laws in some devolved areas for up to seven years. It has produced its own alternative Brexit legislation, which was passed by MSPs in March but is currently subject to a legal challenge by the UK government.

"This video can not be played Phillip Lee announces he is resigning The government has suffered its first resignation over Brexit, with Justice Minister Phillip Lee calling for a change in strategy. Mr Lee warned the current approach would damage businesses in his Bracknell constituency. He accused the government of trying to ""limit"" Parliament's role and called for another referendum once ministers' chosen path becomes clear. It came ahead of a series of votes on the government's EU Withdrawal Bill. The government avoided defeat in one of these votes - on giving MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexit if they do not agree with the deal negotiated by the UK government - by 26 votes after a late concession to critics. Ministers win Brexit vote after concession PHow big a problem is it for May? The concession is believed to include offering a new Parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers. Revealing he had abstained in that vote, Mr Lee said he was ""delighted"" at the government's concession, adding: ""This justifies my decision to resign and makes it a lot less painful.""

Mr Lee, who supported Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, has previously warned about the economic impact of Brexit. In astatement on his website,external, he said Brexit was ""more complex than was ever envisaged"" and he could not support ""how our country's exit from the EU looks set to be delivered"". It is ""irresponsible to proceed as we are"", he said, calling for the UK to ""pause, extend or revoke"" the Article 50 process which formally triggered its departure from the EU. He singled out the issue of the ""meaningful vote"" being offered to Parliament on the final deal reached between the UK and the EU. The government has proposed a ""take it or leave it"" vote, rejecting calls for Parliament to decide what happens next if it rejects the deal. But Mr Lee said: ""In all conscience, I cannot support the government's decision to oppose this amendment because doing so breaches such fundamental principles of human rights and Parliamentary sovereignty. ""A vote between bad and worse is not a meaningful vote. And I cannot bring myself to vote for it in the bastion of liberty, freedom and human rights that is our Parliament."" Allow Twitter content?

"Fashion chain New Look is continuing to cut prices as it tries to turn around its business. New Look wants 80% of its clothes to sell for less than Â£20. The price cuts come amid falling sales. Like-for-like sales plunged by 11.7% in the financial year which ended in March, and website sales tumbled 19%. New Look is one of many retailers this year thatstruck a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA)under which a company buys time to sort out its debts. It is trying to broaden its appeal to include older customers, giving it an age target range of between 18 and 45. Results from New Look, which has hundreds of stores and has been a High Street presence since 1969, contrast sharply with online rival Boohoo, which also reported results. Sales of its three brands, Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal were 53% higher in the most recent quarter compared with the same quarter last year. Boohoo brands target customers aged between 18 and 28, with clothes priced at about Â£15. What's behind the stark contrast in the fortunes of New Look and Boohoo? Is it just that New Look is saddled with an expensive High Street presence, while Boohoo is online only? Actually it seems to go deeper than that. New Look's online business had a bad year as well. Charlotte Pearce, retail analyst at GlobalData, says New Look's poor performance is a result of its ""loss of relevance"" among UK shoppers over the last couple of years. New Look is broadly targeting the 16-44 year old shopper, while Boohoo and its other brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal are all much more narrowly focused on 16-24 year olds. By trying to appeal to too many different shoppers, New Look has ended up appealing to none as ""its proposition is unclear"", says Ms Peace. She also says New Look's product ranges ""lack excitement and its product is much safer"" compared with the ""daring"" designs of the online-only fashion retailers. Retailers like Boohoo are ""more in tune with millennials in terms of providing trend-led and boundary-pushing fast fashion,"" she says. As a result she reckons New Look would ""struggle"" to lure back these 16-24 [year old] shoppers because it hasn't kept up with the likes of Boohoo. However, Ms Pearce doesn't think New Look should be putting effort into trying to recapture the younger shoppers who have been lured away by Boohoo and others because the competition is so ""intense"". Instead she says New Look needs to adjust its target customer base to focus on the older 25-34 year olds. Clothing retailer Ted Baker also released profits on Tuesday. Its half-year sales were up 4%, mainly thanks to growth in its online sales. New Look also booked a one-off cost of Â£34m, partly for discounting old stock. The company said it had made ""significant progress"", which will be reflected in next year's results. Last November it brought back Alistair McGeorge, who ran the business between 2012 and 2014. Mr McGeorge said: ""Last year was undoubtedly very difficult for New Look, with a well-documented combination of external and self-inflicted issues impacting our performance. ""We still have more work to do to restore long-term profitability, but I am confident we are now better placed to achieve this than we were when I returned to the business over six months ago.""

"Both leaders appeared pleased with the summit, despite the declaration being relatively vague Watching reactions to the Singapore summit as it unfolded became the ultimate foreign policy Rorschach test - everyone came away with a different picture of what happened. There are those who will laud it for establishing a seemingly new approach to US-North Korea relations, one that is more co-operative than confrontational. There are those who will praise it for abandoning the all-or-nothing negotiation style and opting for a more pragmatic and longer-term process, providing enough time and space to work out the details of where we're headed and how to get there. Others will see this as having accomplished nothing new or specific on the denuclearisation front and having simply given both leaders the media attention they so crave. Of course, none of these interpretations are mutually exclusive. Handshake moment explained in pictures Full text of the signed statement The Singapore summit was certainly historic in the sense that this was the first meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president, but the results are harder to judge. While past US presidents have avoided granting such a meeting without North Korea first making verifiable progress towards dismantling its weapons of mass destruction programmes, Donald Trump has forgone this traditional diplomatic approach for one that could potentially make negotiations more agile. After all, securing a top down mandate for mutually-agreed-upon goals may generate the political will, priority and personal capital for both sides to sustain this process and see it to the end. Moreover, the personal relationship now established between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un may also help prevent us in the future from returning to ""fire and fury"" at the drop of a dime. This video can not be played Trump: ""The past does not have to define our future"" However, in terms of the substance of the Singapore summit, the declaration signed by the two leaders offered only broad-stroke commitments to peace, denuclearisation and redefining the overall nature of US-North Korea relations. This language certainly covers the underlying issues encompassed in North Korea's definition of hostile US policy, but the lack of detail and the mirroring of past commitments is concerning. Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector Diplomacy on a plate: What did they eat? Five odd moments from the summit At the very least there were expectations (or strong desires) that this summit would establish a mutual understanding of what the US considers the core issue: what ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" actually means, especially with respect to South Korea and the role of US extended deterrence. What is it that the US and North Korea are actually committing to? And at what point during this process will we gain that understanding? How do we measure success if we have not set clear goals? While the vague language is not all that unusual for a summit declaration, the details revealed by President Trump during his post-summit press conference about specific measures may raise even more questions and highlight the challenges of moving forward with parallel bilateral negotiation tracks. The one issue Mr Trump seemed to make clear was that US-South Korea joint military exercises would be suspended while negotiations were ongoing. This has long been a point of contention for the North Koreans, especially as the exercises have expanded to include offensive drills, but it raises the question of how this concession fits into a larger process. Mr Trump said the joint US-South Korea exercises were expensive and provocative The reaction out of Seoul on this point seems to indicate that, despite Mr Trump's call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in before the summit, the Blue House was once again caught off-guard by this announcement. This lack of co-ordination, or at least communication, with allies during negotiations causes rifts that can be exploited in parallel processes and, unless addressed, will weaken both US and South Korean negotiating power. Overall, both Mr Trump and Mr Kim walked away pleased with what they had accomplished and the publicity of their historic meeting. The most important commitment made was to continue high-level engagement to fill in the details of the agenda the declaration laid out. This certainly could be the catalyst needed on both sides to take the process further than where we have been able to get to before, but it will still be a negotiation, and Kim Jong-un's diplomatic debut over the past few months, culminating in his incredible reception in Singapore, has increased North Korea's confidence and negotiating power. While it is welcome that we are moving away from a path towards war, the test is now on the Trump administration to see if it has the political will to sustain this process and move the negotiation past broad commitments towards durable and sustainable solutions.

"This video can not be played Was the summit a win-win for both countries, or a Kim win? The handshake has happened, the summit is over, and now Donald Trump is hitting the media circuit - including his first sit-down interview with a major news network other than Fox - to make the case for what he has accomplished. Because it's Mr Trump, some of what he has to say is head-scratching, other parts will have his supporters smirking or swooning, while many of his critics will be outraged. Here are a few of his key lines - and what they could mean. ""He's got a great personality. He's a funny guy. He's very smart. He's a great negotiator. He loves his people, not that I'm surprised by that."" This was Mr Trump's response when Voice of America's Greta Van Susteren asked what he found surprising about the North Korean leader. He would alsotell ABC's George Stephanopoulos,externalthat the North Korean people love him back and that they have ""great fervour"" for their leader. That the US president says he was not surprised that Mr Kim, who oversees a totalitarian regime that imprisons an estimated 120,000 of its people for political reasons, ""loves his people"" or that they love him will certainly come as a shock to many human rights advocates. In fact, the pageantry of the summit, Mr Trump's solicitous manner and his kind words for Mr Kim have already drawn the ire of some of the president's critics - and others who have, in the past, largely held their tongue. 'A missed chance' says defector The summit's oddest moments Did rhetoric match reality? Handshake moment explained in pictures ""I think the North Korean flag is a piece of vile filth that stands for the dynastic rule of a racist cult that subjugates, tortures and enslaves its own people,""writes National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg,external, regarding the display of US and North Korean flags at the summit site. ""Ideally it would spontaneously combust when it even touches our flag."" TheNational Rifle Association's Dana Loesch said,externalshe was ""not a fan"" of having the US and North Korean flags together, ""as any sort of equals"". Several reporters pressed Mr Trump on North Korea's record of human rights violations - and whether the president, who described Mr Kim as ""talented"", should have been more cautious with his language. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough - I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it - he ran it,"" Mr Trump said in reply to a question about his praise of Mr Kim. ""Very few people, at that age - you can take one out of 10,000, probably, could do it."" That ""talented"" line provoked a response from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. ""This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done."" Donald Trump, in his press conference, announced that Mr Kim had ""reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"". He had also agreed to ""vigorous"" negotiations to implement the agreement. Agreements and negotiations have happened in fits and starts for nearly three decades, of course. Mr Trump sees a different outcome because he sees himself differently. He's the consummate dealmaker. This video can not be played The hidden messages in Trump-Kim gestures ""My whole life has been deals,"" he told reporters. ""I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't."" Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised his predecessors, saying that they didn't get the job done - but he campaigned on the promise that he would be a different kind of president and would get a different, better result. It's a view he's not backing away from. ""I think he trusts me, and I trust him."" During the US-Soviet arms disarmament negotiations of the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan coined the phrase ""trust but verify"". On multiple occasions on Tuesday, Mr Trump said he trusts Mr Kim - and Stephanopoulos brought the Reagan line up during his interview with the president. Mr Trump responded that the US and North Korea would be working together and developing ""great relationships at different levels"". As for the details? The ""trust"" has been professed, but the ""verify"" is yet to be spelled out. ""If I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honour to do it."" One of the prime lines of criticisms directed at Mr Trump for participating in the summit is that he is encouraging other rogue regimes to develop their own nuclear weapons so that they can stand on equal footing with a US president. Mr Trump has shredded an agreement with Iran that was designed to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear arsenal. It is an ""honour"", on the other hand, for the president to deal with Mr Kim, a ""very powerful man"" who has ""powerful nuclear weapons"". Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who has largely supported the Trump administration, makes the distinction clear. ""Countries like Iran and Cuba and other two-bit rogue regimes don't have nuclear weapons yet,""he told,externalradio host Hugh Hewitt. ""They can't threaten the United States in that way. Once North Korea had nuclear weapons, once they have missiles that can deliver them to use, I would liken it to past presidents sitting down with Soviet dictators."" Nuclear weapons got North Korea to the table. The big question now is what it will take for the US to convince Mr Kim to give them up. ""I think the initial rhetoric was very important. Frankly, as much as I hated to do it, and as much as some people thought I was doing the wrong thing, I think without that we wouldn't be here."" It was just under one year ago that Mr Trump warned North Korea that its threats against the US would be met by ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"". He'd go on, over the course of the following months, to deride Mr Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and disparage the size of his ""nuclear button"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance Lines like those had pundits, politicians and analysts expressing shock and concern that the US was on a path to war - and inside reports from the White House of military deliberations and planning did nothing to ease minds. Now Mr Trump is saying that it was all part of his strategy - a modern-day incarnation of Richard Nixon's ""madman"" gambit with the North Vietnamese - which he says may have made him look ""foolish"" but has proven to be effective. ""We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should."" This nugget was nestled at the beginning of the question-and-answer portion of Mr Trump's post-summit press conference - and it represents a significant concession on the part of the US side. Even using the term ""war games"" itself comes across as a nod to the North Koreans. Annual US-South Korea joint military training exercises had been a constant source of irritation for the North, which viewed the operations as preparation for war. Mr Trump is ending them - at least for the moment - and perhaps most noteworthy is that he couched the revelation as a cost-saving step. That may play well with Mr Trump's base, who rallied around Mr Trump's campaign pledge to spend US resources at home, not abroad - although it does mark a change of tack from the president's boasts of record level of military spending in the latest US budget for a depleted US armed forces. ""Honestly, I think he's going to do these things.  I may be wrong.  I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.'  I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."" This line - a president admitting that he may not admit to mistakes - raised more than a few eyebrows, but it's part of what makes Mr Trump so irresistible to his supporters. They thoroughly believe that all politicians lie, that they all will never admit mistakes, that they all say whatever they think voters want to hear. Mr Trump, at least in their estimation, is being open about it. He is, in effect, letting them in on the joke. Maybe this is a mistake. Maybe the negotiations will fall apart. Maybe Mr Trump will find some sort of excuse. But, if that happens, he'll do it with a wink and a nod to those who have stood by him through it all.

"The two leaders signed the agreement at their historic summit in Singapore During the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the US and North Korea committed to recovering the remains of American troops missing in action during the Korean War. Thousands of US military personnel remain unaccounted for. The number varies fromstate-to-state,external. For example 431 Texans and 593 Californians are unaccounted for, while there is one man from Alaska on the list of missing. Most of them - about 5,300 - were lost in what is now North Korea, according to theUS defence agency,externalthat oversees the process of recovering the remains of American troops. And the US Army says it knows exactly where many are buried. Fighting stopped in 1953 - but technically the two Koreas remain at war. The conflict ended with an armistice agreement not a peace treaty. American-led UN forces, including troops from the UK, supported the South, while Chinese forces joined the war on the North's side. Estimates vary, but at least two million Korean civilians, up to 1.5 million communist and about 400,000 South Korean, 30,000 US and 1,000 UK service personnel are believed to have died.

It seems the historic summit has boosted President Trump's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize - at least in the eyes of the bookmakers. They have slashed the odds on him winning following the summit. Ladbrokes cut the odds from 10/1 to 6/4, and William Hill offered the same odds for Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un to win it jointly in the next couple of years. But Mr Trump wouldn't be the first US president to bag the award. In 2009, only a year into his term of office,US President Barack Obama wonfor ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"".

what he wanted â the pomp, circumstance and prestige of a meeting with the
President of the United States â while making no specific commitments in
return"". Delaware senator Chris Coons added: ""This was a dream outcome for Kim Jong-un... legitimacy on the world stage,
an invitation to the White House, no concessions on human rights, and no clear
concessions on a timeline or a process for denuclearisation."" ""For this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, for it to be
anything more than a reality TV handshake summit, thereâs going to need to be a
lot of hard work in the months ahead and Iâm concerned that the Trump
Administration isnât prepared to do that hard work,"" Mr Coons said in an interview with MSNBC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Wow. Super Tuesday just turned into messy Tuesday. You might never have heard of him, but Phillip Lee, a minister, has just resigned from his job in government in public over what he described as the government's ""detrimental"" Brexit policy. He said that sometimes government had to act to protect citizens from the decisions of the majority, outlining why he felt the government's chosen course on Brexit would be bad for the country and bad for his constituents. It has been clear for a while that the now ex-minister, one of the rising generation in the Tory party, has been frustrated for some time. But what's not clear is whether his decision is solely the result of one politician's frustrations, or the start of something bigger. Davis seeks to stave off Brexit bill defeat Minister quits government over Brexit Brexit: All you need to know He is categorically not the only Tory MP among the younger ranks who is upset and irritated by how the government is handling Brexit. Another in that group told me last week, ""the horses are circling the paddock - everyone is getting their websites ready"", the implication that leadership contests are not so far away. Another source said yesterday that the October conference this year would be the ""biggest beauty parade ever"", with it becoming increasingly clear in their view, that the day of Brexit will be the moment when pressure on Theresa May will become untenable. That is not a view that is universally shared of course. This ministerial resignation could be a one day drama, he could be replaced with little fuss. But Mr Lee's voice adds one more to the band of potential rebels against the government that could defeat them in Parliament. More than that, his decision might give other ministers in the middle ranks the courage to speak out too. This might, just might be, the start of something where a rising generation in the party makes it plain to the older, they need to shape up or ship out.

"The app would judge a person's drunkenness based on how they type, walk and hold their phone Taxi app company Uber has applied for apatent,externalto use artificial intelligence to determine how drunk potential passengers might be. The app used to summon rides could also feed other information to the driver, including a passenger's location, how accurately they are typing and even the angle they are holding their phone at. It could help drivers who do not want to pick up inebriated riders. But critics said it could also be used to identify vulnerable passengers. According to the application to the US patent office, the system would spot ""uncharacteristic user activity"". Uber does not have the best track record when it comes to collecting data. In 2014 it was revealed the company used a software program known as God View to monitor real-time locations of customers and drivers. That, coupled with a data breach that exposed personal data about more than 100,000 Uber drivers, made the company introduce tough measures to protect the privacy of drivers and customers. Uber's co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned in June 2017 over allegations of sexual harassment at the scandal-hit company. CNN reported that more than 100 Uber drivers in the US had been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing passengers in the past four years, with 31 drivers convicted of crimes including false imprisonment and rape. Critics expressed concern that an app that could predict user behaviour could be used by drivers wishing to prey on vulnerable passengers. In a statement, Uber said: ""We are always exploring ways that our technology can help improve the Uber experience for riders and drivers. ""We file patent applications on many ideas, but not all of them actually become products or features.""

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit.

And like many royal families through the ages, it must sometimes kill to protect its position. On 12 February 2017, a group of friends gathered in a restaurant in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it must sometimes kill to protect its position. On 12 February 2017, a group of friends gathered in a restaurant in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

To get that America and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”, his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"Knickers in a twist: People have hung their washing outside in support of Claire Mountjoy A town is ""festooned with pants, socks and pyjamas"" after residents came out in support of a mum who received an anonymous letter about her laundry. Pants are flying from flagpoles in Colyton, Devon, after Claire Mountjoy received a note asking her not to air her washing outdoors. The letter urged her to keep Colyton ""a town we can all be proud of"". She said it was ""lovely"" more than a dozen homes and shops were now hanging their laundry outside in support. More on this story and others from Devon Claire Mountjoy said Colyton ""has a tradition of being slightly rebellious"" Laundry rebellion: Clothes hung up inside a shop The anonymous letter was written ""on behalf of local business"" and asked Ms Mountjoy ""with kindness"" not to put washing out at the front of her terraced house, which is in ""a prime location"". It said: ""While we understand you have a small house with no outside room for your boys, would you please consider using a tumble dryer or hanging the washing indoors. ""This letter is not written with malice but we ask you to please help us all keep Colyton a town we can all be proud of."" A smalls victory: People are parading their underwear in public Ms Mountjoy, an education officer for Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ""Colyton has a tradition of being slightly rebellious and I think that has been shown.

Edward Jacobsposted on Facebook,externalin support of her: ""Love it and I'm proud to say that Colyton is my nearest town... just up the road. Personally I think the anonymous letter was 'pants'."" Robin Bell said: ""Love this town's stance on things it shows where the heart comes from."" And Natalie Izzy Ellis wrote: ""It's a way of life isn't it? That's what has got my back up.

According to local historians,external, Colyton became known as the ""most rebellious town in Devon"" during the Monmouth Rebellion as more citizens from the town joined the Protestant rebellion against James II in 1685 than from any other in the county. It depends on where you live and what you use, according to the Energy Saving Trust. For people living in houses, drying clothes outdoors on a washing line or indoors on a rack costs nothing and uses no energy so it is the ""ideal way"" to dry your clothes, it says. But if you live in a flat or somewhere else without outside space and need to use a tumble dryer, the trust advises choosing one with a good energy label rating such as an A++ or A+++. Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth said: ""Drying clothes outside rather than using a tumble dryer saves a huge amount of energy, which makes it more environmentally friendly as well as saving people money on their bills. ""If using a tumble dryer is absolutely necessary, wringing out clothes or spin drying them first will lessen the amount of energy needed.""

"Both leaders appeared pleased with the summit, despite the declaration being relatively vague Watching reactions to the Singapore summit as it unfolded became the ultimate foreign policy Rorschach test - everyone came away with a different picture of what happened. There are those who will laud it for establishing a seemingly new approach to US-North Korea relations, one that is more co-operative than confrontational. There are those who will praise it for abandoning the all-or-nothing negotiation style and opting for a more pragmatic and longer-term process, providing enough time and space to work out the details of where we're headed and how to get there. Others will see this as having accomplished nothing new or specific on the denuclearisation front and having simply given both leaders the media attention they so crave. Of course, none of these interpretations are mutually exclusive. Handshake moment explained in pictures Full text of the signed statement The Singapore summit was certainly historic in the sense that this was the first meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president, but the results are harder to judge. While past US presidents have avoided granting such a meeting without North Korea first making verifiable progress towards dismantling its weapons of mass destruction programmes, Donald Trump has forgone this traditional diplomatic approach for one that could potentially make negotiations more agile. After all, securing a top down mandate for mutually-agreed-upon goals may generate the political will, priority and personal capital for both sides to sustain this process and see it to the end. Moreover, the personal relationship now established between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un may also help prevent us in the future from returning to ""fire and fury"" at the drop of a dime. This video can not be played Trump: ""The past does not have to define our future"" However, in terms of the substance of the Singapore summit, the declaration signed by the two leaders offered only broad-stroke commitments to peace, denuclearisation and redefining the overall nature of US-North Korea relations. This language certainly covers the underlying issues encompassed in North Korea's definition of hostile US policy, but the lack of detail and the mirroring of past commitments is concerning. Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector Diplomacy on a plate: What did they eat? Five odd moments from the summit At the very least there were expectations (or strong desires) that this summit would establish a mutual understanding of what the US considers the core issue: what ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" actually means, especially with respect to South Korea and the role of US extended deterrence. What is it that the US and North Korea are actually committing to? And at what point during this process will we gain that understanding? How do we measure success if we have not set clear goals? While the vague language is not all that unusual for a summit declaration, the details revealed by President Trump during his post-summit press conference about specific measures may raise even more questions and highlight the challenges of moving forward with parallel bilateral negotiation tracks. The one issue Mr Trump seemed to make clear was that US-South Korea joint military exercises would be suspended while negotiations were ongoing. This has long been a point of contention for the North Koreans, especially as the exercises have expanded to include offensive drills, but it raises the question of how this concession fits into a larger process. Mr Trump said the joint US-South Korea exercises were expensive and provocative The reaction out of Seoul on this point seems to indicate that, despite Mr Trump's call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in before the summit, the Blue House was once again caught off-guard by this announcement. This lack of co-ordination, or at least communication, with allies during negotiations causes rifts that can be exploited in parallel processes and, unless addressed, will weaken both US and South Korean negotiating power. Overall, both Mr Trump and Mr Kim walked away pleased with what they had accomplished and the publicity of their historic meeting. The most important commitment made was to continue high-level engagement to fill in the details of the agenda the declaration laid out. This certainly could be the catalyst needed on both sides to take the process further than where we have been able to get to before, but it will still be a negotiation, and Kim Jong-un's diplomatic debut over the past few months, culminating in his incredible reception in Singapore, has increased North Korea's confidence and negotiating power. While it is welcome that we are moving away from a path towards war, the test is now on the Trump administration to see if it has the political will to sustain this process and move the negotiation past broad commitments towards durable and sustainable solutions.

"MPs should not ""undermine"" the UK's position when they vote on the EU bill, Brexit Secretary David Davis says. Opening two days of debate, Mr Davis said a bid to give Parliament more control would tie ministers' hands and lead to a bad deal for the UK. MPs then accused each other of trying to ""wreck"" Brexit and, from the other side, being ""zealots"" who wanted to sideline Parliament. Earlier the government was hit by its first resignation over Brexit. As voting began in the Commons, the government defeated the first three amendments, which focused on Parliamentary scrutiny. And a late concession - believed to include offering a new Parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers - may have avoided defeat on the key demand for a ""meaningful vote"". Live updates: MPs debate EU bill changes Minister quits government over Brexit How big a problem is Lee's resignation for May? The Brexit amendments MPs are voting on Earlier, starting the Commons debate, Mr Davis told MPs the bill's ""primary purpose"" was to ensure a ""functioning statute book"" on the day the UK leaves the EU, 29 March 2019. The most tightly-contested amendment is likely to be the call for Parliament to decide what happens next if MPs decide they do not like the UK-EU Brexit deal. This video can not be played Stand up for what you believe in - Tory MP Mr Davis said this would represent a ""profound constitutional shift"" and that the government, not Parliament, should be in charge of international negotiations. Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh agreed, saying the change would amount to a ""wrecking of the will of the people"", and Sir Bill Cash said it was ""just a cover for a reversal of the decision"" to leave the EU. But pro-EU Conservative veteran Ken Clarke criticised ""real zealots"" who were trying to ""stop this Parliament playing any part in the process"". The government's offer to make a statement if the Brexit deal was not approved by MPs would amount to saying ""Oh House of Commons, get lost"", he claimed. This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow tells MPs not to be intimidated Another likely Tory rebel, Anna Soubry, criticised some of her Conservative colleagues, saying their ""life's ambition"" was to take the UK ""over the cliff to the hard Brexit"". Ms Soubry also raised threats made to MPs over the issue, saying one of her colleagues needed six armed protection officers when attending a public event. As the debate continued, the government tried to convince potential rebels to back down, with Solicitor General Robert Buckland offering to hold talks with one of them, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, on Wednesday. Mr Lee has called for a referendum on the final Brexit deal Phillip Lee has been a junior justice minister since July 2016, having first been elected as the Bracknell MP in 2010. Explaining the reasons for his resignation, he cited the government's opposition to the ""meaningful vote"" amendment, saying this position ""breaches fundamental principles of human rights and Parliamentary sovereignty"". He also raised concerns about the economic impact of leaving the EU, saying Brexit had turned out to be much more complicated than first thought. The UK should ""pause, extend or revoke"" the Article 50 process which formally triggered its departure from the EU, he said, calling for another referendum once ministers' chosen path becomes clear. Pro-EU campaigners hailed his resignation as significant in their calls for a referendum on the UK and EU's final Brexit deal. Brexit-backing former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was surprised, adding: ""I didn't realise he felt this strongly."" Mr Duncan Smith said the amendment giving more power to Parliament would be ""disastrous"" and allow the House of Lords to ""block the whole passage of Brexit"". This video can not be played Brexit Secretary tells Today the EU referendum is ""irreversible"" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the numbers were still ""rather dicey"" for the so-called meaningful vote amendment. It would mean ministers ""must follow any direction"" set by a House of Commons motion if Parliament rejects the final Brexit deal or negotiations run out of time. The government says this would bind the UK's hands in the negotiations. Brexit: All you need to know Why is the customs union so important? Flashpoints ahead for the Brexit bill Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said a Parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal did not give ""the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum"". Asked what would happen if MPs rejected the deal, he said there would be no time to restart negotiations, with the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. ""If they throw it out, well they throw it out,"" he said. Rebels have dismissed the government's amendment, a commitment by ministers to make a statement within 28 days should MPs vote down the package negotiated by Mrs May. Pro and anti-Brexit protesters demonstrated outside Parliament ahead of the votes A showdown over customs seems to have been averted after a compromise amendment was accepted by the government - which means it has agreed to report to Parliament by October on efforts to negotiate a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU after Brexit. The fallback position has won the backing of a cross-section of leading Tory MPs on either side of the Brexit argument, avoiding for now a showdown over calls - backed by the House of Lords earlier this year - for the UK to remain in a fully-fledged customs union with the EU after it leaves. Mr Davis said a ""great deal of progress"" had been made in negotiations, saying he was expecting both a withdrawal agreement and the ""substance"" of the UK and EU's future relationship to be finalised in October. He also described as ""nonsense"" reports he threatened to resign over the wording of last week's ""backstop"" plan to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? The EU withdrawal bill is the legislation aimed at ensuring the UK has a smooth transition out of the EU, and will mean EU law is no longer supreme in the UK. To avoid a sudden ""cliff edge"" on Brexit day, 29 March 2019, it would also convert existing EU law into UK law so the government and Parliament can decide at a later date which bits they want to keep or change. The House of Lords has put forward 15 specific changes to the bill, but the government wants to kill off most of these changes. However, numbers in the House of Commons are finely balanced, with the Conservatives not having a majority and needing the help of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get their way. On Monday, Mrs May told her MPs they ""must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week"". ""I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible,"" she said. ""But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined."" Please upgrade your browser Labour, which is backing 14 out of the 15 amendments, is urging Tory rebels to seize the chance to ""decisively shape the course of the negotiations"". Jeremy Corbyn's party is also divided on Brexit, with several MPs unhappy Labour is not backing a bid to keep the UK part of the EU's single market, like Norway. There is still a chance of a squeaky moment for the government, or having to rely on votes from some Labour MPs, on a move to give Parliament more power if MPs vote to reject the final Brexit deal. Sources tell me the numbers are still rather dicey for that so called ""meaningful vote"" amendment that will take place tomorrow. There are discussions ongoing among potential rebels about whether they should deploy their forces. Some of them believe, as they do on the customs issue, that they have the numbers to beat the government if they decide it's the right moment. Appeals for party unity in the last couple of days, and the compromise on customs seem to have had some sway. Read Laura's full blog Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"This video can not be played The government has dodged a defeat on its key Brexit legislation The government has avoided a major defeat on its Brexit bill by 324 votes to 298 after a late concession. Ministers saw off a move to give MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexit if they do not agree with the deal negotiated by the UK government. Following a meeting with Theresa May, Tory MPs said they had been promised ""input"" into what the government would do if the UK faced a no-deal scenario. But one minister told the BBC he would commit only to ""further discussions"". Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the government remained ""open-minded"", but this may or may not result in it coming forward with new proposals in the coming days. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told by a government source that no actual concessions had been agreed and the only agreement was to keep talking. Scottish government wants devolution changes Minister quits government over Brexit Phillip Lee quits: How big a problem is it for May? Tuesday's Commons debate marked the start of the government's attempts to undo most of the changes to its EU Withdrawal Bill that were put forward by the House of Lords. This video can not be played Solicitor General, Robert Buckland says Brexit legislation will be improved The most contentious was the bid to give Parliament the power to tell the government what to do if the Brexit deal was voted down or no agreement was reached. While in the end, only two Tory MPs - Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry - voted against the government, there were clashes over how much of a say Parliament should get as the UK leaves the EU, with one side accusing the other of trying to ""wreck"" Brexit - and being accused in turn of being ""zealots"" who wanted to sideline Parliament. Seeking to placate would-be Conservative rebels, government frontbenchers offered to meet them to discuss their concerns, and agreed to ""engage positively"" on a ""compromise"" put forward by one of them, former attorney general Dominic Grieve. Details of precisely what this will involve will be agreed in the coming days when the bill is due to return to the House of Lords and ministers could table a fresh amendment. Analysis by BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy The government would not have sought a deal if it thought it had the votes to win, and they clearly blinked. The decision to seek a compromise marked an important victory for the soft Brexit/Remainer/""realist"" Tory rebels, who have been promised an amendment giving them most of what they want. Read Mark's full blog Mr Grieve said he had ""confidence and trust"" in Theresa May to address the concerns of more than a dozen MPs who are reported to have held last-minute talks with the prime minister in her Commons office during the debate. He said if the UK and EU were unable to agree a deal in the autumn, or if MPs rejected the deal on offer as inadequate, there would be a ""national crisis"", with the real prospect of the UK leaving in March 2019 without an agreement. This video can not be played Sir Edward Leigh urges MPs not to ""stand in the way of the people"" This video can not be played Stand up for what you believe in - Anna Soubry says In such a situation, he said, Parliament should be able to flex its muscles by requiring ministers to come forward with a plan of action, which MPs would be able to debate and vote on.

But the government is not believed to be willing to agree to Mr Grieve's call for MPs to effectively take control of negotiations in the last resort if no deal is agreed by February 2019. Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the influential European Research Group of MPs, told the BBC a concession of this kind would have been ""revolutionary"" as the Commons could not override the government when it came to negotiating international treaties. The leading Brexiteer said Mrs May had ""paid attention to both sides"" and the unity displayed by his party would strengthen the PM's hand in negotiations in the run-up to June's EU leaders' summit. Fellow Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said he was pleased the Lords amendment, which he said would have given Parliament an effective veto over Brexit, had been ""soundly and significantly defeated"". Labour, five of whose MPs defied the leadership by voting with the government, said the prime minister may have avoided a ""humiliating defeat"" but the fight to ensure Parliament had a ""proper role"" in shaping the outcome of negotiations would continue. ""We will wait and see the details of this concession and will hold ministers to account to ensure it lives up to the promises they have made to Parliament,"" said the party's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer. Earlier, the government suffered its first ministerial resignation over Brexit as Phillip Lee quit the Ministry of Justice so he could speak out freely. Phillip Lee spoke from the backbenches after quitting his ministerial job Mr Lee said Parliament was being sidelined, and called for another referendum to be held when the final direction of Brexit became clear. Revealing he had abstained in the Commons vote on Parliament's role, he said he was ""delighted"" at the government's concession, adding: ""This justifies my decision to resign and makes it a lot less painful."" The government, meanwhile, has reversed a series of other changes made by the Lords to the EU Withdrawal Bill, including reinstating the precise day of departure - 29 March 2019 - in the proposed legislation. A government amendment on the Irish border, guaranteeing there will be no new border arrangements without the agreement of the UK and Irish authorities, was also approved by MPs.

"Monaghan (right) was seen being led to a prison van at court in Lewes after he was jailed A British Airways pilot who turned up for work after drinking three double vodkas has been jailed. Julian Monaghan boarded a plane to Mauritius at Gatwick Airport but was led away in handcuffs after colleagues smelled alcohol and called police. He had 86mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system in January - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. Monaghan, 49, admitted being over the prescribed limit and was jailed for eight months at Lewes Crown Court. During sentencing Judge Janet Waddicor told Monaghan, who resigned from his British Airways job, ""you took a risk and it didn't pay off because you were caught"". ""You are in charge of a huge aircraft. The safety, if not the lives, indeed, of passengers and crew members are in the hands of the pilot. They are entitled to feel that they are safe."" Monaghan insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour ""bottle to throttle rule"" On arrest, Monaghan, from South Africa, told police he drank a glass of wine on his overnight flight as a passenger from Cape Town to Heathrow. He said he consumed ""a measure"" of vodka with diet Pepsi in his hotel room on an empty stomach and barely slept before he was due on board the long-haul flight to Mauritius. The court heard Monaghan had since remembered drinking three miniature bottles of vodka. He insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour ""bottle to throttle rule"", which forbids pilots from drinking for that amount of time before going on duty. He had initially queried the results of tests but resigned two months after his arrest when further tests confirmed the samples were accurate. Amy Packham, prosecuting, said the reading taken at 22:30 GMT remained so high that he must have drunk a ""significant amount"" just before the eight-hour limit. Some 300 people were on the 12-hour flight, which had been scheduled to leave at 20:20. But the Boeing 777 was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot. It eventually took off just before 23:00. Monaghan would not have had to take up the role of pilot until three-and-a-half hours into the flight, the court heard. Emlyn Jones, defending, said Monaghan - whose childhood dream was to be a pilot - had been ""extremely stupid"" and bitterly regretted his actions. ""Certainly he will never fly as a commercial pilot again. His career and livelihood and personal and professional reputation are all up in smoke."" Det Con Stuart Macpherson, of Sussex Police, said: ""Had Monaghan been required to take control of the aircraft in the event of an emergency on the flight deck in the early stages of the flight, his judgement and abilities would have been impaired."" A British Airways spokeswoman said: ""This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots.

He had initially queried the results of tests but resigned two months after his arrest when further tests confirmed the samples were accurate. Amy Packham, prosecuting, said the reading taken at 22:30 GMT remained so high that he must have drunk a ""significant amount"" just before the eight-hour limit. Some 300 people were on the 12-hour flight, which had been scheduled to leave at 20:20. But the Boeing 777 was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot. It eventually took off just before 23:00. Monaghan would not have had to take up the role of pilot until three-and-a-half hours into the flight, the court heard. Emlyn Jones, defending, said Monaghan - whose childhood dream was to be a pilot - had been ""extremely stupid"" and bitterly regretted his actions. ""Certainly he will never fly as a commercial pilot again. His career and livelihood and personal and professional reputation are all up in smoke."" Det Con Stuart Macpherson, of Sussex Police, said: ""Had Monaghan been required to take control of the aircraft in the event of an emergency on the flight deck in the early stages of the flight, his judgement and abilities would have been impaired."" A British Airways spokeswoman said: ""This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots.

"This video can not be played James Murray spoke to BBC Radio 5 live. The father of a University of Bristol student who took his own life wants data protection rules changed to prevent further deaths at universities. Ben Murray, 19, died in May and was the 10th Bristol student to take their life in the last two years. His father James Murray is now calling for the rules to be relaxed so parents can be told if students are struggling. The university said it was considering an ""opt-in"" for next of kin to be told of a ""major concern about wellbeing"". The teenager, who was studying English, was described as having a ""brilliant mind"". He achieved straight As at GCSE, enjoyed sports and was ""loved by all his friends and family""- who had no idea he was suffering from anxiety - his father said. ""Ben told us at the end of the first term at Bristol University he was enjoying himself and to all intents and purposes he seemed to be having a good time,"" Mr Murray toldBBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster. The teenager was described as having a ""brilliant mind"" with ""everything in front of him"" But on the morning of his death, he met his father for lunch and spoke of ""bottling up his feelings and thoughts"". ""It was a lovely lunch. He started by saying he'd wished he'd been more open which at the time seemed like he was opening up about his thoughts and feelings,"" his father said. ""But there was no sign at all - nothing at all."" It was only after his death the family discovered Ben had been falling behind in his studies, missing lectures and was days away from ""being removed from the university"". ""He was carrying a lot of pain and anxiety for six months and wasn't telling us what was going on,"" Mr Murray said. ""Now the more questions you ask, the more opportunities you see for intervention and the more distressed you become."" Mr Murray said the university had ""been very open"" with the family since their son's death but had followed the data privacy rules while he was studying there. ""Having gone through all the different moments when we could have intervened to save our son's life, it's absolute nonsense that you would look at an issue and say: 'You're an adult therefore data privacy applies',"" he said. ""Data privacy that may cause the vulnerable to lose their lives makes no sense at all."" It was only after Ben's death his family discovered he had been falling behind in his studies The university's plans include implementing an ""opt-in"" which would ""enable contact with nominated next of kin"" over wellbeing concerns Mr Murray is calling for the rules to be relaxed or changed to ""allow universities to communicate more openly"" and wants tutors to be more accountable for wellbeing, as well as academic success. ""Tutors are the front line in terms of dealing with students,"" he said. ""They have the first early warning signs of something being wrong so they need to be held accountable."" In a statement, Bristol University said student mental health and wellbeing was the ""single biggest challenge the higher education sector faces"". ""As a university we are taking every step we can, working with our students, staff, and health partners to ensure our community is as safe and supportive as we can possibly make it,"" it said. ""Our vice-chancellor has met with Ben's father and we are actively working with his, and other parents, as part of our plans to create a structure of preventative services and policies that avoids our students reaching crisis point. ""This includes implementing an 'opt-in' contract with our students which would enable contact with nominated next of kin if we had a major concern about their wellbeing.""

In Tuesday's episode Alex announces: ""For personal reasons unfortunately he [Niall] can't continue or come back to the villa."" Niall was Love Island's ""rainbow fish"" Reacting to his departure in the beach hut, current partner Georgia says: ""Obviously I was coupled up with him so obviously I came closer to him than most people in here but it wasn't just that. He was actually my friend, my buddy."" Alex meanwhile adds: ""I'm obviously sad that Niall's left the villa. We got on really, really well. He's such a great guy. And I look forward to catching up with him and having some fun with him outside."" Niall had become one of the series favourites with his cheeky personality and references to Harry Potter. He described himself as a ""rainbow fish"" and said his best attribute was his ""chat"" - although the girls on Love Island seemed to be just as taken with his looks.

"They did not eat this many Korean dishes For a man who likes well-done steaks with a side of tomato ketchup, it was quite a complicated menu. ""Green mango kerabu with honey lime dressing and fresh octopus""; ""Oiseon - Korean stuffed cucumber""; ""Daegu jorim - soy-braised cod fish with radish, Asian vegetables"". There were lots of words President Trump is likely to have been unfamiliar with. And the watching Twitterati were bemused. Sasa Petricic, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist,external, asked whether the two leaders would ""reach the HaagenDazs without a melt-down, or will things go sour by the crispy pork?"" Others pondered whether Trump would eat something like octopus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oiseon - made up of cucumbers stuffed with beef, egg and carrot - is a traditional dish dating back to the Joseon Dynasty that ruled from 1392-1897. And it was also the kind of thing eaten by the royal family. Live updates from Singapore Trump and Kim make history with a handshake Who are Kim Jong-un's running bodyguards? So it's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII. No wonder young Koreans were scratching their heads. Some - understandably - mistook the dish for ""oisobagi"" - cucumber kimchi - something that people eat daily. ""I wonder what it tastes like?"" one South Korean pondered in a tweet. But another dish on the menu - the Daegu Jorim - was more familiar. Jorim involves boiling meat, fish or vegetables in a soy-based broth until most of the liquid is absorbed. It would commonly be eaten as one of the many small dishes that make up a typical Korean meal. So it's safe to say that while Pyongyang cold noodles (which Mr Kim gave to his South Korean counterpart when he crossed the border for the first time in April) weren't on the menu, the Singaporean hosts made a significant effort to make Mr Kim feel at home. And being wise and careful diplomats, they did not leave Mr Trump in the cold. In fact, it appears that the menu was crafted in such a way that he could enjoy a slap-up lunch that wouldn't look out of place in a brash 1980s New York restaurant. Allow Twitter content?

For starters, he could have picked the ""traditional prawn cocktail served with avocado salad"". For his main the ""beef short rib confit served with potato dauphinoise and steamed broccolini"". And for dessert ""the Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis"". And if there was any doubt beef short rib was designed for Mr Trump, here's the giveaway: it was served with red wine sauceon the side. Mr Trump is of course, famously, a teetotaller. Korean summit sparks cold noodle craze However the Singaporeans - who have splashed out $15m on the summit - didn't miss out on their chance to give the high-profile visitors a taste of their own food. The city state is known for its diversity and mix of Chinese, Indian and Malay dishes (the three main ethnic groups). Aside from the short rib confit, the other main was a ""combination of sweet and sour crispy pork and Yangzhou fried rice with home-made XO chili sauce"" - the kind of dish you would find at a Singaporean Chinese restaurant. XO sauce is seen as a premium ingredient and named after fine cognac (extra-old, hence the XO). It is made from dried scallops and prawns, garlic and chilli. But while some Singaporeans will claim it as their own, it is actually believed to have originated in Hong Kong in the 1980s.  And of course the Yangzhou fried rice is a more direct nod to China - a looming but unseen presence at these talks. It's worth noting though that this kind of fried rice is the typical one served at Chinese restaurants in the US. So perhaps this was a subtle message that the US and China had to agree a compromise on North Korea's future. Or perhaps we are reading too much into this. Yangzhou fried rice - a nod to China? The other ""local"" dish on the menu was a Malay ""green mango kerabu with honey lime dressing and fresh octopus"". Kerabu is a kind of salad, usually made with a dressing that has lime juice, sugar and chilli. So this no doubt carefully-constructed menu had nods to all the key players - the US and the West (is it a stretch to say the chocolate ganache was a wink to the European Union?), both of the Koreas, China, and of course the Singaporean hosts. Japan and Russia might be feeling a little left out - but this was diplomacy on a plate.

"North Korea's beaches could represent a new business opportunity, according to Mr Trump US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore was a historic event, marking the first time that current heads of the two countries have met. From the historic handshake between the two leaders to the signing of a joint agreement, experts have analysed the meeting and its significance for future US-North Korean relations. But there were some odd moments of the day, which have got people talking. Before he became president, Donald Trump was better known for his property empire. But it was still a surprising moment to hear the US leader mention a lesser known North Korean attraction: its coastline. ""They (North Korea) have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, 'Boy look at that view. Wouldn't that make a great condo?',"" he told reporters after meeting Mr Kim. North Korea: surfer's paradise? The US government currently advises against all travel to North Korea and says that its citizens who decide to go should draft a will before departure. Before the two leaders sat down for a working lunch, Mr Trump jokingly asked photographers: ""Getting a good picture, everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin?"" However, his words seem to have been lost in translation, judging by Mr Kim's blank expression. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On a background of tense music and strong images, a dramatic narrator asked: ""Will this leader choose to advance his country... Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen?... Which path will be chosen?

"This video can not be played Kim: ""The world will see a major change"" US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have signed a document following a landmark summit in Singapore - the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. Here is the full text of the statement: Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit. President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018. President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new US-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Convinced that the establishment of new US-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognizing that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following: 1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity. 2. The United States and DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. 3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified. Having acknowledged that the US-DPRK summit - the first in history - was an epochal event of great significance in overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening up of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un commit to implement the stipulations in the joint statement fully and expeditiously. The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-on negotiations, led by the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the US-DPRK summit. President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have committed to cooperate for the development of new US-DPRK relations and for the promotion of peace, prosperity, and the security of the Korean Peninsula and of the world.

"This video can not be played Most of the 629 migrants are sub-Saharan Africans French President Emmanuel Macron has accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let a stranded rescue ship packed with migrants dock in Italy. A charity looking after the 629 migrants on the Aquarius, stranded off Malta, says two Italian ships will help take them to Spain's port of Valencia. Spain is some three days' sailing away. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hit back angrily at France, calling its stance on migrants ""hypocritical"". He criticised ""countries that have always preferred to turn their backs when it comes to immigration"". In the past five years Italy has taken in more than 640,000 mainly African migrants and says its EU partners must ease the burden. Most migrants who survive the perilous voyages from North Africa end up in overcrowded Italian camps. Among them are refugees fleeing war and persecution, who have a right to asylum. The Aquarius migrants, mainly sub-Saharan Africans, were picked up off Libya's coast at the weekend. They were found in inflatable boats and are now being looked after by Doctors without Borders (MSF) and the Franco-German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e aboard the Aquarius. Mr Macron's spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the French president recalled that ""in cases of distress, those with the nearest coastline have a responsibility to respond"". ""There is a degree of cynicism and irresponsibility in the Italian government's behaviour,"" he quoted President Macron as saying. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya The plan is for the Aquarius to be joined by an Italian coastguard ship and a warship, then for all three to head for Valencia. The coastguard ship Dattilo and the warship are expected to take migrants on board from the Aquarius in the coming hours. There are medics and UN Children's Fund (Unicef) workers on the Dattilo. SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e tweeted photos of fresh supplies arriving on board on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier the crew said the ship could not sail to Spain while it was overcrowded, and conditions at sea were deteriorating. Among the migrants are seven pregnant women, 11 young children and 123 unaccompanied minors. The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges. Fifteen migrants have serious chemical burns and several suffered hypothermia, according to MSF. The Aquarius is operated by SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e and Doctors without Borders (MSF) Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio shrugged off the French criticism. ""I'm glad the French have discovered responsibility: if they want, we will help them,"" he said. ""Let them open their ports and we will transfer a few of the people to France."" Earlier, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini defended his refusal to let the ship dock, saying:  ""Saving lives is a duty, turning Italy into a huge refugee camp is not."" Instead he urged Malta to receive the migrants. His right-wing League party is in a new populist government which has pledged to stop the migrant influx to Italy and deport failed asylum seekers. However, the Italian coastguard ship Diciotti is currently taking 937 migrants to the Sicilian port of Catania. They were picked up not by charities but by the EU naval rescue mission off Libya. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who took office a week ago, said he would give ""safe harbour"" to the Aquarius, after Italy and Malta had refused. The nationalist authorities on the French island of Corsica also offered to receive the Aquarius, before the latest plan involving Italian ships was announced. Aid worker Aloys Vimard, also on board, told the BBC the migrants were afraid they would be returned to Libya. Rules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable"". This video can not be played Former Aquarius volunteer: ""The whole deck will be full of people"" By Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, BBC News The EU wrote its rules about how migrants should be handled in the 1990s, when no-one could have imagined the collapse of Libya would create huge flows of desperate people heading across the Mediterranean from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The rules say migrants are the responsibility of the first member state where they land - an overwhelming problem in countries like Greece and Italy, where the election of a populist government is at least in part a response to the pressure. And when Matteo Salvini proclaims ""victory"", he's telling his voters that the promise of a tougher line on immigration is real. He is challenging the EU to find a proper solution too, based on forcing other member states to accept quotas of migrants - something it has failed to do so far. And he's incidentally created a big question for Spain. Will its offer to the Aquarius be extended to more ships in the future?

"This video can not be played Arron Banks laughs off the idea he is an ""evil genius with a white cat controlling the whole of western democracy"" Arron Banks has told MPs probing ""fake news"" his Brexit campaign had sometimes ""led people up the garden path"". But he said politicians were also guilty of spin and claimed Parliament was the ""biggest source of fake news"". The tycoon, who spent more than Â£6m on Leave.EU, said he had faced ""absurd"" claims of Russian conspiracies. Media committee chairman Damian Collins said it was ""difficult to know"" whether to take his evidence - and that of colleague Andy Wigmore - seriously. Leave.EU donor 'must explain Russia link' Arron Banks refuses to appear before MPs Facebook: Russian Brexit meddling 'minimal' Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. It ran a ""disruptive"" campaign instead, Mr Banks told the committee, adding: ""We were not above using alternative methods to punch home our message or lead people up the garden path if we had to."" Mr Wigmore, Leave.EU's director of communications, said ""the piece of advice that we got, right from the beginning, was remember referendums are not about facts, it's about emotion and you have got to tap into that emotion"". He said the campaign had aimed to ""make fun"" of journalists and his role in it had been that of an ""agent provocateur"". Asked what the difference was between provocation and lies, he said: ""If you are trying to sell something or put a good case over to somebody you will tell the best story. If that's provocation - or a lie, if you want to call it that, yeah."" Bristol-based insurance tycoon who was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms One of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU and UKIP Born in Cheshire, the twice married father-of-five was a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage A Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at working class voters angry about EU immigration Mr Banks used his appearance before the Commons media select committee to hit back at claims he was involved in a conspiracy with Russian officials, saying there was ""not one shred of evidence"" for it. He was ""not an evil genius with a white cat controlling... western democracy"", he told the committee, accusing its members of being ""Remainers"" with a ""vested interested in trying to discredit the Leave campaign"". He then went on to attack the credibility of Brittany Kaiser and Chris Wylie, whistleblowers who had previously given evidence to the committee about controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica. He dismissed Cambridge Analytica as an ""advertising agency"" that ""did a little bit of politics on the side"". ""We had two or three meetings with them and it became clear to me that - as is true in a lot of politics - there is a lot of sizzle and sometimes not a lot of substance,"" he said. He also addressed revelations at the weekend that he had had two more meetings with the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko than he had previously disclosed in his book on the referendum battle, The Bad Boys of Brexit. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage spoke at a Trump campaign rally in August 2016 The last of these was in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks, Mr Wigmore and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met Mr Trump in New York following his presidential election victory. According to details of emails reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer, Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia including a proposal involving six gold mines. Mr Banks attempted to laugh off suggestions of a conspiracy over his meetings with Mr Yakovenko, telling MPs: ""I was hoping for a good lunch and that is what I did gain from it."" He added: ""The only thing we gave in the second meeting was the telephone number of the (Trump) transition team because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team."" He said Leave.EU had ""briefed the American security services on everything that transpired"". Mr Collins and his committee is looking into fake news in elections Mr Banks denied he was in Moscow in February 2016, as claimed by the Sunday Times, and produced passports containing Russian visas which he said proved he had been in Moscow twice in recent years, in March 2015 and October 2014. Mr Wigmore said he had first sought a meeting with Russian officials at a UKIP conference in his role as a then diplomat for Belize, a small central American nation and former British colony. ""His (Mr Banks') wife is also Russian. We thought it would be nice,"" he told MPs. Mr Wigmore said he had spoken to the ambassador about possible Russian investments in a banana farm in Belize and a port, owned by a bank belonging to former Conservative deputy-chairman and donor Lord Ashcroft. Mr Wigmore said the meeting with Mr Trump had not been planned and only came about because the US President's adviser Kellyanne Conway had asked if they ""wanted to go and see the boss"" when they were in Trump Tower, in New York. He claimed he gave the Trump transition team the phone number of Number 10 Downing Street, because the team had ""no relationship"" with the British government. Mr Banks - who was grilled by MPs for nearly three hours - refused to answer a final set of questions from Labour MP Ian Lucas, saying the session had overrun and he had a lunch appointment to go to. Mr Wigmore had kicked off the session by calling on Mr Collins to stand aside as chairman because he accepted hospitality from ""Putin's number one man in the United Kingdom"" and might be ""conflicted"". Mr Collins recorded a trip to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his register of member's interests. He called the suggestion a ""nice try"" adding ""you might have better intelligence than me... I didn't know that Roman Abramovich was Putin's number one man in London"". In a statement after the hearing, Mr Collins said: ""Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand. ""So it is difficult for the Committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high ranking Russian officials."" He said his inquiry would be writing to the pair to follow up some of the points they had made, adding: ""Our inquiry is about getting to the truth of these matters.""

"They did not eat this many Korean dishes For a man who likes well-done steaks with a side of tomato ketchup, it was quite a complicated menu. ""Green mango kerabu with honey lime dressing and fresh octopus""; ""Oiseon - Korean stuffed cucumber""; ""Daegu jorim - soy-braised cod fish with radish, Asian vegetables"". There were lots of words President Trump is likely to have been unfamiliar with. And the watching Twitterati were bemused. Sasa Petricic, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist,external, asked whether the two leaders would ""reach the HaagenDazs without a melt-down, or will things go sour by the crispy pork?"" Others pondered whether Trump would eat something like octopus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Oiseon - made up of cucumbers stuffed with beef, egg and carrot - is a traditional dish dating back to the Joseon Dynasty that ruled from 1392-1897. And it was also the kind of thing eaten by the royal family. Live updates from Singapore Trump and Kim make history with a handshake Who are Kim Jong-un's running bodyguards? So it's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII. No wonder young Koreans were scratching their heads. Some - understandably - mistook the dish for ""oisobagi"" - cucumber kimchi - something that people eat daily. ""I wonder what it tastes like?"" one South Korean pondered in a tweet. But another dish on the menu - the Daegu Jorim - was more familiar. Jorim involves boiling meat, fish or vegetables in a soy-based broth until most of the liquid is absorbed. It would commonly be eaten as one of the many small dishes that make up a typical Korean meal. So it's safe to say that while Pyongyang cold noodles (which Mr Kim gave to his South Korean counterpart when he crossed the border for the first time in April) weren't on the menu, the Singaporean hosts made a significant effort to make Mr Kim feel at home. And being wise and careful diplomats, they did not leave Mr Trump in the cold. In fact, it appears that the menu was crafted in such a way that he could enjoy a slap-up lunch that wouldn't look out of place in a brash 1980s New York restaurant. Allow Twitter content?

For starters, he could have picked the ""traditional prawn cocktail served with avocado salad"". For his main the ""beef short rib confit served with potato dauphinoise and steamed broccolini"". And for dessert ""the Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis"". And if there was any doubt beef short rib was designed for Mr Trump, here's the giveaway: it was served with red wine sauceon the side. Mr Trump is of course, famously, a teetotaller. Korean summit sparks cold noodle craze However the Singaporeans - who have splashed out $15m on the summit - didn't miss out on their chance to give the high-profile visitors a taste of their own food. The city state is known for its diversity and mix of Chinese, Indian and Malay dishes (the three main ethnic groups). Aside from the short rib confit, the other main was a ""combination of sweet and sour crispy pork and Yangzhou fried rice with home-made XO chili sauce"" - the kind of dish you would find at a Singaporean Chinese restaurant. XO sauce is seen as a premium ingredient and named after fine cognac (extra-old, hence the XO). It is made from dried scallops and prawns, garlic and chilli. But while some Singaporeans will claim it as their own, it is actually believed to have originated in Hong Kong in the 1980s.  And of course the Yangzhou fried rice is a more direct nod to China - a looming but unseen presence at these talks. It's worth noting though that this kind of fried rice is the typical one served at Chinese restaurants in the US. So perhaps this was a subtle message that the US and China had to agree a compromise on North Korea's future. Or perhaps we are reading too much into this. Yangzhou fried rice - a nod to China? The other ""local"" dish on the menu was a Malay ""green mango kerabu with honey lime dressing and fresh octopus"". Kerabu is a kind of salad, usually made with a dressing that has lime juice, sugar and chilli. So this no doubt carefully-constructed menu had nods to all the key players - the US and the West (is it a stretch to say the chocolate ganache was a wink to the European Union?), both of the Koreas, China, and of course the Singaporean hosts. Japan and Russia might be feeling a little left out - but this was diplomacy on a plate.

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods.

And like many royal families through the ages, it must sometimes kill to protect its position. On 12 February 2017, a group of friends gathered in a restaurant in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and all the evidence pointed towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang.  Why?

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said.

I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working.

But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said.

To get that America and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”, his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"If a woman decides not to breastfeed her baby it is her choice and must be respected, midwives are being told. The Royal College of Midwives' new position statement makes it explicitly clear that women should be supported if, after being given advice, information and support, they opt to bottle feed using formula milk. Although breast is best, often some women struggle to start or sustain breastfeeding, says the RCM. Informed choice must be promoted. TheNational Childbirth Trust,externalsays women can experience unacceptable levels of pressure however they feed their babies - from family and friends, as well as from people they hardly know. Mothers who breastfeed their babies often feel pressurised and constrained about whether, where, how often, and how long they breastfeed. Similarly, mothers who use formula milk often feel judged or guilty too, particularly - but not only - if they planned to breastfeed. Quarter of mums made 'uncomfortable breastfeeding in public Paying mothers to breastfeed Hospital's 'artificial feeding' letter to mothers criticised Are there downsides to 'breast is best'? Researchers at Liverpool University studied the experiences of more than 1,600 new mums in 2016. Among the 890 who did formula feeding, 67% reported feeling guilty, 68% felt stigmatised and 76% felt the need to defend their feeding choice. Similar emotions were less common but still present among the breastfeeding mums, particularly for those who supplemented breastfeeding with formula. Investigator Dr Victoria Fallon, from the university's school of psychology, said: ""We looked at a range of emotions and found that women who started exclusively breastfeeding but then stopped were most likely to feel guilty, while those who bottle-fed from birth often felt stigma."" Nicola Kay had a very difficult birth, but wanted to breastfeed her son Ethan. It took several days for her milk came through. ""He was crying and sleeping a lot because he wasn't getting the food he needed,"" she said. Nicola and Ethan ""Most of the midwives were insistent that I continue to breastfeed, but then in the middle of the night he wouldn't stop crying, and I couldn't feed him. ""A midwife came in and asked me if I wanted to give him some formula. I did and I felt a mixture of guilt and relief that he was eating."" The 32-year-old did begin expressing milk, but she had to feed her son from a bottle rather than a breast. ""I was given loads of advice, but in the end it just wasn't happening and I thought the best thing to do was feed with formula."" The scientist from North Wales said she did not receive the same support when she switched to formula, and added: ""It felt like I'd been abandoned. ""No-one said I'd made the wrong choice, but it was hinted that I made the wrong choice."" Tabby, 33 and from North London, wanted to breastfeed exclusively but was worried that her son, Arthur, was not putting on enough weight. Tabby and Arthur ""I tried for three weeks. It was incredibly stressful. You feel like you're not providing for your child. I felt like I was failing him."" Tabby spoke with her midwife who organised for a breastfeeding advisor to visit her and Arthur at home. ""That gave me the confidence to know what I had been doing was right. I was feeding properly, but Arthur still wasn't putting on enough weight. We ended up putting him on some formula as well as breast milk. They were concerned that he might have dairy intolerance so I also stopped drinking milk and eating any dairy. ""I'm so glad the midwife acted quickly. By giving some formula it helped me continue to breastfeed Arthur."" Keilly, from London, says she was given conflicting advice about how to feed her baby girl, Amelie. Amelie, aged six months in this photo with her mum, Keilly, is now 22 months and has recently stopped breastfeeding ""One health visitor told me I should top Amelie up with formula because she was underweight, but another one said I absolutely should not put her on a bottle. It was so confusing. ""I think it's hard for first-time mums to know what to do for the best. In the end, we gave Amelie one bottle a day and did the rest with breastfeeding. With hindsight, we probably didn't need to and could have stuck with exclusive breastfeeding instead, but it worked for us as a family."" The UK has one of the lowest rates of breastfeeding in Europe. Although most new mothers try it initially, less than half are still exclusively breastfeeding when their baby is six weeks old. This drops to about 1% at six months,figures suggest,external. Experts recommend, whenever possible, babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of their life, and breastfeeding should continue for up to two years or beyond alongside introducing solid foods. But, ultimately, it should be the woman's choice, says the RCM. Proportion of infants breastfed at 6-8 weeks in England Chief Executive Gill Walton said: ""The RCM believes that women should be at the centre of their own care and as with other areas of maternity care, midwives and maternity support workers should promote informed choice. ""If, after being given appropriate information, advice and support on breastfeeding, a woman chooses not to do so, or to give formula as well as breastfeeding, her choice must be respected. ""We recognise that some women cannot or do not wish to breastfeed and rely on formula milk. They must be given all the advice and support they need on safe preparation of bottles and responsive feeding to develop a close and loving bond with their baby."" Dr Fallon says the advice is a step in the right direction, but she is concerned that current breastfeeding promotional strategies are not ""mum-friendly"" enough and can foster negative emotional experiences. ""We can't dispute the health benefits of breastfeeding, but in the UK we have one of the world's worst breastfeeding rates even though lots of women do say they want to breastfeed. ""Breastfeeding promotion needs to be accompanied by practical and emotional support."" TheNHS Start4Life website,externalhas useful tips on breastfeeding and infant nutrition.

"Monaghan (right) was seen being led to a prison van at court in Lewes after he was jailed A British Airways pilot who turned up for work after drinking three double vodkas has been jailed. Julian Monaghan boarded a plane to Mauritius at Gatwick Airport but was led away in handcuffs after colleagues smelled alcohol and called police. He had 86mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system in January - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. Monaghan, 49, admitted being over the prescribed limit and was jailed for eight months at Lewes Crown Court. During sentencing Judge Janet Waddicor told Monaghan, who resigned from his British Airways job, ""you took a risk and it didn't pay off because you were caught"". ""You are in charge of a huge aircraft. The safety, if not the lives, indeed, of passengers and crew members are in the hands of the pilot. They are entitled to feel that they are safe."" Monaghan insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour ""bottle to throttle rule"" On arrest, Monaghan, from South Africa, told police he drank a glass of wine on his overnight flight as a passenger from Cape Town to Heathrow. He said he consumed ""a measure"" of vodka with diet Pepsi in his hotel room on an empty stomach and barely slept before he was due on board the long-haul flight to Mauritius. The court heard Monaghan had since remembered drinking three miniature bottles of vodka. He insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour ""bottle to throttle rule"", which forbids pilots from drinking for that amount of time before going on duty.

"Christian Louboutin has been battling to protect its red sole designs Europe's highest court has backed Christian Louboutin in its battle to protect its distinctive red soles. In 2012, Louboutin sued rival firm Van Haren for selling high heeled shoes with scarlet soles. Under EU law companies cannot trademark common shapes of products such as the soles of shoes. Van Haren argued that applying red to a shoe sole came under that law and, as a result, Louboutin did not have trademark protection. However, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that shape trademarks do not apply to Louboutin's red sole. Christian Louboutin first designed his trademark shoe in 1993, using an assistant's red nail polish. The luxury brand said it ""warmly welcomes"" the judgement. ""For 26 years, the red sole has enabled the public to attribute the origin of the shoe to its creator, Christian Louboutin,"" the brand said in a statement.

"Jack Renshaw admitted two charges on the first day of the trial An alleged member of a banned neo Nazi group has admitted planning to murder a Labour MP in an act of what he termed ""white jihad"", a jury has heard. Jack Renshaw, 23, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to preparing an act of terrorism by buying a machete to kill West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. He also admitted making a threat to kill police officer Victoria Henderson. Renshaw, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, is one of six men on trial who deny being in the group National Action. The other accused are: Christopher Lythgoe, 32, and Michal Trubini, 35, both from Warrington; Matthew Hankinson, 24, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside; Andrew Clarke, 33, from Prescot, Merseyside, and Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth, Merseyside. Mr Lythgoe also denies encouragement to murder by allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. Renshaw had previously denied the two charges, but changed his pleas at the start of his trial. Prosecutors said Renshaw wanted to take hostages to lure Det Con Henderson to the scene so he could kill her too. But the court heard the plan was foiled after a disenchanted former member of National Action reported the threat to Hope Not Hate, an organisation seeking to combat extreme right-wing political racism. Prosecutors told the jury that National Action had supported the murder of MP Jo Cox in June 2016. Duncan Atkinson QC, said the defendants were ""not being prosecuted for their racist or neo-Nazi beliefs, however repulsive they may be, but for their participation in a banned organisation that sought actively through fear, intimidation and the threat of violence rather than through free speech and democracy to shape society"". He said Renshaw was preparing a ""politically and racially motivated murder"", and had sought the ""blessing"" of Mr Lythgoe. Mr Lythgoe, the prosecutor added, was effectively the national leader of National Action and ""nothing significant"" happened without his approval. The six men deny membership of a proscribed organisation He said National Action had engaged in a ""campaign of virulent anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda"" since 2013. It was formally put on a government list of proscribed organisations in December 2016, but the defendants' active participation in the group did not stop with the ban, Mr Atkinson said. Jurors were told that Mr Lythgoe sent an email to others members just before the ban, saying: ""Long term we'll keep moving forward just as we have been"" - and the next day he wrote: ""We are just shedding one skin for another"". Mr Atkinson told the court that Robbie Mullen had been a member of National Action before the ban but became disillusioned with the group, particularly after the murder of Jo Cox. Jurors heard that, on 1 July last year, at a meeting attended by most of the defendants and Mr Mullen, Renshaw said that he planned to kill Rosie Cooper. The court heard Renshaw said he had already purchased a 19-inch (50 cm) long machete, and it was later found at his home. Rosie Cooper is the Labour MP for West Lancashire Mr Atkinson said Renshaw's ""objective was not simply to make a political point, as he put it to kill for National Action and white jihad, but to revenge himself on those he considered to be persecuting him"", namely Lancashire Police, and Det Con Henderson in particular. Renshaw told the meeting that after killing Ms Cooper, he would take hostages, and demand Det Con Henderson attend the scene, the prosecution claimed. ""His plan then would be to kill that officer who was, he said, his real target,"" Mr Atkinson told jurors."" The court heard Renshaw had been arrested in January 2017 on suspicion of stirring up racial hatred over two anti-Semitic speeches he had given. He was interviewed by Det Con Henderson and another officer and then for a second time after analysis of a seized mobile phone ""revealed what the police considered to be evidence of child sex offences or grooming"". Renshaw had talked about how police were trying to destroy his life and make it sound like he was a paedophile, prosecutor said. He said after he had killed the officer he would commit ""suicide by cop"" by pretending to be wearing a suicide vest and would also make a video to say the attack had been done on behalf of National Action. Jurors were told Mr Mullen believed Renshaw was serious and there was an imminent threat to life, and reported what had been said to his contacts at Hope not Hate. Hope not Hate director Nick Lowles alerted the MP Ruth Smeeth -  who once worked at the charity - and she in turn warned Ms Cooper, leading to the police inquiry, Mr Atkinson said. The trial was adjourned until Wednesday.

"Almost three-quarters of women in seven UK cities never ride a bike for local journeys, despite having a positive perception of cycling, says a survey. More than 7,700 residents of Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Greater Manchester were surveyed for Sustrans. ""Most of our cities are failing to design roads and streets for women to cycle,"" the charity said. It says more dedicated routes would encourage people to ride bikes. The cities surveyed are so-called Bike Life cities - part of a UK-wide assessment of cycling. Twice as many men as women cycle at least once a week in the cities, the report said. This is despite 72% saying things would be better if people in general cycled more often and more than two-thirds (68%) believing their city would be a better place to live and work if more people cycled. What is stopping women from cycling? Lorries and potholes put people off cycling How to get into cycling - BBC Get Inspired guide The research found that many women simply do not feel safe cycling. Just 27% thought cycling safety was good in their city. ""There should be investment in on-road dedicated cycle lanes, protected from motor traffic, that get people to where they want to go directly and efficiently,"" said cyclist Verity Leigh, from Edinburgh. ""I've always cycled with my children on my bike from the time that they were babies. It's a practical thing for us, it's just a choice that makes our lives easier,"" Cerys Furlong, who lives in Cardiff, said. The report pointed to the success of Cambridge - which has the UK's highest level of cycling - and attributed it to low speed limits, extensive cycle routes and expensive parking. ""Evidence from the UK and beyond shows that when dedicated space for riding a bike is provided, alongside engagement programmes, the gender gap in cycling can be eliminated,"" Sustrans chief executive Xavier Brice said. The charity recommends prioritising women's road safety through protected routes and providing training programmes to enable more women to use bikes. Dr Rachel Aldred, a transport academic at the University of Westminster, said women ""too often have limited mobility"". ""Enabling women to cycle can open up opportunities and help make our society more gender equal and inclusive,"" she said. Earlier this month, a survey by charity Cycling UK suggested the most common reason people were put off cycling wassharing the road with large lorries. What is stopping women from cycling?

"Monaghan (right) was seen being led to a prison van at court in Lewes after he was jailed A British Airways pilot who turned up for work after drinking three double vodkas has been jailed. Julian Monaghan boarded a plane to Mauritius at Gatwick Airport but was led away in handcuffs after colleagues smelled alcohol and called police. He had 86mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system in January - the legal limit for a pilot is 20mg. Monaghan, 49, admitted being over the prescribed limit and was jailed for eight months at Lewes Crown Court. During sentencing Judge Janet Waddicor told Monaghan, who resigned from his British Airways job, ""you took a risk and it didn't pay off because you were caught"". ""You are in charge of a huge aircraft. The safety, if not the lives, indeed, of passengers and crew members are in the hands of the pilot. They are entitled to feel that they are safe."" Monaghan insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour ""bottle to throttle rule"" On arrest, Monaghan, from South Africa, told police he drank a glass of wine on his overnight flight as a passenger from Cape Town to Heathrow. He said he consumed ""a measure"" of vodka with diet Pepsi in his hotel room on an empty stomach and barely slept before he was due on board the long-haul flight to Mauritius. The court heard Monaghan had since remembered drinking three miniature bottles of vodka. He insisted he obeyed the airline's eight-hour ""bottle to throttle rule"", which forbids pilots from drinking for that amount of time before going on duty. He had initially queried the results of tests but resigned two months after his arrest when further tests confirmed the samples were accurate.

"Violence in Central American nations spurs many to try to leave The US attorney general has ruled that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence should no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US. Jeff Sessions' ruling overturns a 2016 decision which granted asylum to a woman from El Salvador who had been raped and abused by her husband. Activists criticised the move, saying it will affect tens of thousands. Mr Sessions has said he has a ""zero tolerance"" stance toward illegal immigration on the country's border. ""Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum,""Mr Sessions wrote in his 31-page ruling released on Monday,external. ""The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes - such as domestic violence or gang violence - or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim."" The unnamed woman - known in court documents as A-B - entered the US illegally in 2014, and requested asylum on the basis her former spouse had repeatedly abused her ""emotionally, physically and sexually"". America's top law official has a ""zero tolerance"" policy on illegal migration US and international law currently say that people can seek asylum if they fear persecution at home on the basis of their race, political opinion, nationality, religion or because they belong to a particular social group. The US Board of Immigration Appeals found in 2016 that the woman qualified under the ""particular social group"" definition, but Mr Sessions overturned the finding on Monday. US federal prison for immigration detainees Immigrant detained after delivering pizza He wrote in his ruling that the category was currently ""inherently ambiguous"" and concluded it should not be used as ""'some omnibus catch-all' for solving every 'heart-rending situation""'. This video can not be played ""Why I joined Central America's brutal MS-13 gang"" ""The asylum statute does not provide redress for all misfortune,"" he said, adding that the woman was a victim of ""private criminal activity"" rather than state-sponsored persecution. ""Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day all over the world,"" the attorney general said in advance of his ruling. It is unclear how many cases are affected by the ruling, but activists say that at least 10,000 people per year are granted asylum in the US on the basis of domestic abuse and gang violence in their home countries. Pro-immigration groups say they plan to fight Mr Sessions' decision, which is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to place restrictions on immigration. Last week, Mr Sessions defended the department's policy of separating migrant children from their parents after they have crossed into the US. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown Activists say the ruling will especially resonate in Central America, where gang violence is rampant. Is US only country to separate migrant children? Migrants from that region frequently cite gang violence as the reason for seeking refuge in the US. Latin American countries also have some of the worst rates of violence against women in the world, according to the UN. The decision ""will no doubt result in sending countless mothers and children back to their abusers and criminal gangs,""said Beth Werlin of the American Immigration Council,external. ""Turning our backs on victims of violence and deporting them to grave danger should not be the legacy sought by any administration.""

An eyewitness said the front door ""blew off the house""in Llanbradach, Caerphilly, at about 17:30 BST on Monday. Police are not looking for anybody else in connection with the blast, which was not related to the mains gas network. The mother of one of those hurt said she was ""still in shock"". Jayne Muller said her 18-year-old daughter Beccy Edwards was visiting her boyfriend Jordan Ford at the home he shares with his parents in Dan Y Darren when the explosion happened. Investigations are under way into the cause of the explosion She said Beccy was in a different room to Jordan and two of his friends but she suffered a burn to her foot and singed hair. Jordan's mother Sonia, who was downstairs at the time, was also injured. ""I'm just thinking of the boys and the family and everyone who was hurt,"" Mrs Miller said. She said Jordan is now being treated in hospital in Birmingham after being transferred from the specialist burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Family members including his father Jason and grandmother have travelled to Birmingham to be at his bedside, she added. Four other casualties were taken to hospital after the blast and one has since been released. Five in hospital after house explosion South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said all five of the people injured in the fire ""self rescued"" and were helped by neighbours until help arrived. Gwent Police and the fire service said, in a joint statement, there was significant damage to the premises and a cordon was in place as a safety precaution. They are working together to to ""ensure the structural stability of the property"". Wales and West Utilities said its engineers had isolated the house's gas supply and that following tests, it could confirm that the explosion and fire were not related to the mains network. Some 25 fire fighters tackled the blaze and crews will now carry out a ""full and meaningful investigation to determine the actual cause of the incident."" Neighbour Brian Jenkins, 64, said two air ambulances were at the scene. Llanbradach councillor Colin Mann told BBC Radio Wales: ""It was an absolute shock what happened.

"After being defeated 15 times in the House of Lords, the Brexit bill - or EU Withdrawal Bill to give it its formal title - will return to the House of Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday. With so much to cram in, what potential flashpoints and challenges will the government have to face? The Bill is a very important piece of legislation that will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act (which took the UK into what was then known as the European Community) and copy all existing EU legislation into UK law in order to prevent chaos on the day we leave. It has also provided Parliament with an opportunity to shape the course Brexit will take. For instance, in December 2017, MPs voted to amend the Bill and ensure Parliament has a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. The Bill then went to the House of Lords where peers defeated the government another 15 times and voted for their own changes to the Bill. Now, in the final stage of the Withdrawal Bill's passage through Parliament, those changes will be considered by MPs in a rammed day of potentially dramatic votes on 12 June. Keir Starmer defends 'divided' Labour on Brexit EU Withdrawal bill suffers 15th defeat in Lords Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? Because if enough Tory MPs decide to vote with Labour and other opposition parties, the government could be defeated on several key votes. Theresa May's tiny working majority in the Commons is only 14 and that relies on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist party and their 10 MPs. Last December, 11 Conservative MPs voted with opposition parties to defeat the government by only four votes and the question is how many will do so next week. Number 10 has insisted it wants to overturn the Lords amendments, but it might struggle with two of them in particular that deal with Parliament's role at the end of the Brexit negotiations and the UK's future customs arrangements. Theresa May will attend the EU Summit on 28 June While the Cabinet has been trying - and struggling so far - to work out a proposal to put to the EU on the UK's future trading relationship, Parliament has been doing its own thinking. The House of Lords said ministers should take steps to negotiate a new customs union with the EU - something Number 10 has ruled out. Peers passed an amendment requiring the government to demonstrate to Parliament by October that it had tried to negotiate a customs union. This video can not be played The customs union explained in 45 seconds Remaining in such an arrangement after Brexit is now Labour's position and a number of Tory MPs (probably more than the 11 who rebelled in December) are sympathetic to the argument that a new customs union could be the best way of reducing border friction after Brexit. The question is whether they rebel against the government on Tuesday or wait until after the European Council summit later this month, when they could try to amend the Trade Bill instead. The government suffered 15 defeats in the House of Lords A defeat for Mrs May on this next week would certainly be a blow for the government but it would not bind its negotiating hand. The fuzziness of the amendment's wording might mean the government just accepts it and ducks the possibility of defeat. However, that would also amplify the sense there is currently a hole where the government's own customs plan should be. Please upgrade your browser Peers did vote to keep the UK in the European Economic Area (EEA) after Brexit, similar to Norway's arrangement with the EU - which is to be in the single market (and accept obligations like the free movement of people and paying towards the EU budget) but not in the EU's customs union. Again, this is a massive red line for the government which insists the UK will leave the single market. Ministers should be confident of overturning this in the Commons because the Labour leadership is opposed to EEA membership and accepting continued free movement of people. However, we are likely to see a number of MPs such as Labour's Chuka Umunna and the the Conservative Anna Soubry join forces to vote for this amendment. Tuesday will give a good sense of how effective cross-party co-operation is among Remain-supporting MPs who argue Parliament must keep the UK as close as possible to the EU after Brexit. The Labour leadership will hope its new amendment will limit the rebellion among its own ranks It has, calling on ministers to negotiate a new ""single-market deal"" to ensure ""full access"" to the EU's internal market. Labour hopes this will send a signal to voters that it would try to bind the UK much more closely to the single market than the government. But Labour's leadership also hopes this new amendment will limit the rebellion among its ranks on the Lords' European Economic Area (EEA) amendment. Labour will whip its MPs to abstain on that vote but we could still see dozens of Jeremy Corbyn's team back the ""Norway option"" of single market membership because they don't think their party's new amendment amounts to much. For a start, Conservative MPs would never vote for a proposal put forward by the Labour front bench. Secondly, they argue that participating in the EEA is the only way to gain membership of the single market and that anything else is merely posturing. Labour is navigating its own internal divisions over Brexit. Conservative chief whip Julian Smith wrote to MPs to inform them when the votes would take place The one that puts MPs in the driving seat if the House of Commons rejects the final Brexit divorce deal. We already know there will be a ""meaningful vote"" in the Commons when negotiations with the EU have wrapped up. The government says it will be a take it or leave it moment for Parliament to either accept or reject the deal on the table. But the Lords amendment states that MPs will have the power to ""direct the government in their actions"" if Parliament rejects the deal. It would open the possibility of MPs ordering ministers to carry on negotiating instead of leaving the EU without an agreement. The government and Tory Brexiteers are determined to kill this off. Number 10 has tabled its own amendment to the bill. It pledges that the government will deliver a statement setting out its next course of action within 28 days of a parliamentary vote rejecting the Brexit deal. It's a concession that may defuse a Tory rebellion. We'll know by mid-afternoon on Tuesday because this will be one of the first votes up. Defeat would be a big setback for Number 10 and proof that Parliament is taking greater control over Brexit. But Brexiteers would see the same result as threatening to weaken Mrs May's negotiating hand with Brussels ahead of the EU Summit.

"Wage growth unexpectedly slipped to 2.8% from 2.9% in the three months to April, despite unemployment falling by 38,000 to 1.42 million, official figures show. Economists had expected wage growth to remain steady at 2.9%. The slowdown is likely to dampen expectations of an interest rate rise in August. Wage growth is one of the key figures the Bank of England monitors to assess the health of the UK economy. Although it is above the current level of inflation of 2.4%, it remains well below inflation's five-year high of 3.1% seen in November. This consumer spending squeeze is one of the reasons many shops are currently struggling. Wage growth slows despite unemployment fall Economists said the latest figures reduce the chances of a near-term increase in interest rates. HSBC's UK economist, Elizabeth Martins, said: ""The market is pricing in just a 4% chance of a rate rise at the Bank of England's 21 June meeting, so any change to policy would be a big surprise... at this point, the market sees around a 50% chance of an August hike."" The Bank of England, however, is expecting wage growth to pick up. Last month it said it expected to see pay growth of 2.75% a year by the end of 2018, rising to 3.5% by the end of 2020. Analysis byBBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed Why aren't wages rising more quickly? There could be many reasons. Since the financial crisis, lack of investment in new machinery and technology to help firms perform better punched a hole in economic performance. The public sector pay freeze followed by the 1% pay cap has also weighed on the overall numbers. Some economists also argue that a lack of bargaining power - union membership has been in long term decline - is leading to fewer widespread agreements on earnings increases. Read more from Kamal here ""Employment has continued to rise, while the unemployment rate remained at its lowest for over 40 years. ""Wages, both including and excluding bonuses, are continuing to increase, and slightly faster than inflation,"" the ONS's statistician, David Freeman, said. The ONS also said the number of people in work reached a record high of 32.3 million. The ONS's latest figures received a mixed reception. The TUC's General Secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: ""Wage growth is stuck in the slow lane. At this rate pay packets won't recover to their pre-recession levels for years. ""We need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create."" And the British Chambers of Commerce's head of economics, Suren Thiru also took a dimmer view. He said the slowdown in earnings growth was ""a concern"" and was likely to make a rate rise this year less likely: ""The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy."" But Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""Another strong set of labour market figures in April suggests that firms remain positive about the outlook for demand despite the economy going through a soft patch at the start of the year.""

"This video can not be played Most of the 629 migrants are sub-Saharan Africans French President Emmanuel Macron has accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let a stranded rescue ship packed with migrants dock in Italy. A charity looking after the 629 migrants on the Aquarius, stranded off Malta, says two Italian ships will help take them to Spain's port of Valencia. Spain is some three days' sailing away. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hit back angrily at France, calling its stance on migrants ""hypocritical"". He criticised ""countries that have always preferred to turn their backs when it comes to immigration"". In the past five years Italy has taken in more than 640,000 mainly African migrants and says its EU partners must ease the burden. Most migrants who survive the perilous voyages from North Africa end up in overcrowded Italian camps. Among them are refugees fleeing war and persecution, who have a right to asylum. The Aquarius migrants, mainly sub-Saharan Africans, were picked up off Libya's coast at the weekend. They were found in inflatable boats and are now being looked after by Doctors without Borders (MSF) and the Franco-German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e aboard the Aquarius. Mr Macron's spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the French president recalled that ""in cases of distress, those with the nearest coastline have a responsibility to respond"". ""There is a degree of cynicism and irresponsibility in the Italian government's behaviour,"" he quoted President Macron as saying. Reality Check: Claims about migrants arriving in Italy Desperate migrants rescued from the sea UN sanctions for people traffickers in Libya The plan is for the Aquarius to be joined by an Italian coastguard ship and a warship, then for all three to head for Valencia. The coastguard ship Dattilo and the warship are expected to take migrants on board from the Aquarius in the coming hours. There are medics and UN Children's Fund (Unicef) workers on the Dattilo. SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e tweeted photos of fresh supplies arriving on board on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier the crew said the ship could not sail to Spain while it was overcrowded, and conditions at sea were deteriorating. Among the migrants are seven pregnant women, 11 young children and 123 unaccompanied minors. The minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges. Fifteen migrants have serious chemical burns and several suffered hypothermia, according to MSF. The Aquarius is operated by SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e and Doctors without Borders (MSF) Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio shrugged off the French criticism. ""I'm glad the French have discovered responsibility: if they want, we will help them,"" he said. ""Let them open their ports and we will transfer a few of the people to France."" Earlier, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini defended his refusal to let the ship dock, saying:  ""Saving lives is a duty, turning Italy into a huge refugee camp is not."" Instead he urged Malta to receive the migrants. His right-wing League party is in a new populist government which has pledged to stop the migrant influx to Italy and deport failed asylum seekers. However, the Italian coastguard ship Diciotti is currently taking 937 migrants to the Sicilian port of Catania. They were picked up not by charities but by the EU naval rescue mission off Libya. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who took office a week ago, said he would give ""safe harbour"" to the Aquarius, after Italy and Malta had refused. The nationalist authorities on the French island of Corsica also offered to receive the Aquarius, before the latest plan involving Italian ships was announced. Aid worker Aloys Vimard, also on board, told the BBC the migrants were afraid they would be returned to Libya. Rules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances. It says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable"". This video can not be played Former Aquarius volunteer: ""The whole deck will be full of people"" By Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, BBC News The EU wrote its rules about how migrants should be handled in the 1990s, when no-one could have imagined the collapse of Libya would create huge flows of desperate people heading across the Mediterranean from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The rules say migrants are the responsibility of the first member state where they land - an overwhelming problem in countries like Greece and Italy, where the election of a populist government is at least in part a response to the pressure. And when Matteo Salvini proclaims ""victory"", he's telling his voters that the promise of a tougher line on immigration is real. He is challenging the EU to find a proper solution too, based on forcing other member states to accept quotas of migrants - something it has failed to do so far. And he's incidentally created a big question for Spain. Will its offer to the Aquarius be extended to more ships in the future?

"Would it really undermine the UK's negotiating position? The EU has known full well for months that the government will have bumps getting their business through Parliament. Or would possible defeats in the Commons in the next few days simply undermine her? Theresa May tried to warn off her MPs from voting against ministers this week. She has, let's face it, not exactly been having the best of times recently. And with no majority, any knock to her authority sends SW1 into a frantic guessing game - could this be the moment her time is up? But her appeal now is because there will be a frenzy of voting in the Commons in the next couple of days on the draft laws that will take us out of the European union, after the House of Lords tweaked a lot of the plans. The government, as the process staggers on, wants to unpick those changes in the Commons this week. The trouble is, the Tory party is in a bad place, with the government having to do the splits to try to keep the Remainers and the Brexiteers and various factions on board at the same time. No 10 has had to back down on a vote on Wednesday - giving some ground to the Remain side about how customs should work after Brexit. The compromise amendment has bought off some of the potential rebels for the moment, although a big fight on the issue is still expected next month. But there is still a chance of a squeaky moment for the government, or having to rely on votes from some Labour MPs, on a move to give Parliament more power if MPs vote to reject the final Brexit deal. Sources tell me the numbers are still rather dicey for that so called 'meaningful vote' amendment. There are discussions ongoing among potential rebels about whether they should deploy their forces. Some of them believe, as they do on the customs issue, that they have the numbers to beat the government if they decide it's the right moment. Appeals for party unity in the last couple of days, and the compromise on customs seem to have had some sway. But we face another week in a hot and bothered Westminster, where Theresa May can't guarantee she's going to get her way. And nimble work over the Parliamentary numbers by the government whips don't make the bigger problems go away. They allow the government to do what one cabinet minister told me was the number one job right now, ""just getting through the day"". But at the heart of this tussle in Parliament, and inside the Tory party, is still there -  whose version of life after the EU is going to win.

"Wow. Super Tuesday just turned into messy Tuesday. You might never have heard of him, but Phillip Lee, a minister, has just resigned from his job in government in public over what he described as the government's ""detrimental"" Brexit policy. He said that sometimes government had to act to protect citizens from the decisions of the majority, outlining why he felt the government's chosen course on Brexit would be bad for the country and bad for his constituents. It has been clear for a while that the now ex-minister, one of the rising generation in the Tory party, has been frustrated for some time. But what's not clear is whether his decision is solely the result of one politician's frustrations, or the start of something bigger. Davis seeks to stave off Brexit bill defeat Minister quits government over Brexit Brexit: All you need to know He is categorically not the only Tory MP among the younger ranks who is upset and irritated by how the government is handling Brexit. Another in that group told me last week, ""the horses are circling the paddock - everyone is getting their websites ready"", the implication that leadership contests are not so far away. Another source said yesterday that the October conference this year would be the ""biggest beauty parade ever"", with it becoming increasingly clear in their view, that the day of Brexit will be the moment when pressure on Theresa May will become untenable. That is not a view that is universally shared of course. This ministerial resignation could be a one day drama, he could be replaced with little fuss. But Mr Lee's voice adds one more to the band of potential rebels against the government that could defeat them in Parliament. More than that, his decision might give other ministers in the middle ranks the courage to speak out too. This might, just might be, the start of something where a rising generation in the party makes it plain to the older, they need to shape up or ship out.

"Drug use is rejected by a clean-living generation of students Students are more likely to want universities to take a tougher line against drugs on campus, rather than a more liberal response, say researchers. The study - from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and the University of Buckingham - found 71% of students had not taken illegal drugs. But almost 40% thought their university had a ""problem"" with drug use. Hepi's director, Nick Hillman, said students were ""more hardworking and less hedonistic"" than was realised. The study, which surveyed more than a thousand undergraduate students, rejects the image of students being sympathetic to drug use, and suggests a more clean-living generation. It shows 62% wanting a ""stronger line"" from universities to stop the drugs trade on campus and 53% thinking that university authorities do not do enough to discourage drug use. Drugs did not seem to be prevalent enough to be a major worry - with more students concerned about excessive alcohol consumption than illegal drug use. Amy Watson says students are much less likely to be using drugs than the older generation think The negative view of drugs saw them as causing mental health problems and encouraging criminality. Last week an annual study of student attitudes from Hepi gave further evidence of a cultural shift towards a more hard-working approaching to student life. It showed thatstudents wanted to have more teaching hours, seeing a heavier workload as better value for money. Paying tuition fees and the pressure to get a good degree seem to have influenced what students expect from their years at university. Amy Watson, a first-year medicine student at the University of Southampton, thinks the previous generation was more likely to have taken drugs than current students. She thinks that the expectations of older people and media stereotypes of students have created a false perception. ""My parents probably think more people take drugs than really do,"" says Amy. ""People work a lot harder than I expected."" She says there is a ""stigma surrounding drug use"" and she would support the university taking a tougher line on targeting drug dealers. Sam Carmichael says she would support stronger efforts to stop drug dealing But despite the negativity towards illegal drugs, she says the misuse of alcohol is still common in universities. She also says the greatest stigma is now attached to smoking tobacco. Sam Carmichael, a 19-year-old student finishing her first year at the University of Buckingham, says the survey results reflect her own views. Students in her experience are a long way from any drugs culture. She would prefer universities to ""crack down"" on drugs, rather than adopt a more tolerant approach. But she says that there is still a persistent media image of students as drug takers. ""It's less than people think. It's not true,"" she says. She would prefer universities to make particular efforts to stop drug dealing. ""It makes us feel less safe,"" she says. But she also thinks there should be better ""monitoring"" of students who drink too much alcohol and ""get off their faces"". The results from this survey do not agree with another recent piece of research from the National Union of Students, which suggested that abouttwo in five students were drug users. Cannabis, ecstasy, nitrous oxide and cocaine were the most widely used, according to a study which suggested that drugs were much more pervasive than claimed by the Hepi and University of Buckingham report. The NUS says the approach of taking a tougher line on drug use could be counter-productive. ""Punitive approaches and taking a tougher stance on drugs can discourage people from seeking the help they need,"" said NUS officer, Jess Bradley. The differences in findings suggest how different individual experiences and peer groups can be. But Mr Hillman says the ""survey provides an important corrective to some of the wilder ideas about today's students"". Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham, says: ""With illegal drugs, we have been fiddling while Rome burns. ""Illegal drug-taking causes mental health problems, and is a symptom of them. Even students themselves think there needs to be a stronger lead on drug dealing.""

Jayne Muller said her 18-year-old daughter Beccy Edwards was visiting her boyfriend Jordan Ford at the home he shares with his parents in Dan Y Darren when the explosion happened. Investigations are under way into the cause of the explosion She said Beccy was in a different room to Jordan and two of his friends but she suffered a burn to her foot and singed hair. Jordan's mother Sonia, who was downstairs at the time, was also injured. ""I'm just thinking of the boys and the family and everyone who was hurt,"" Mrs Miller said. She said Jordan is now being treated in hospital in Birmingham after being transferred from the specialist burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Family members including his father Jason and grandmother have travelled to Birmingham to be at his bedside, she added. Four other casualties were taken to hospital after the blast and one has since been released. Five in hospital after house explosion South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said all five of the people injured in the fire ""self rescued"" and were helped by neighbours until help arrived. Gwent Police and the fire service said, in a joint statement, there was significant damage to the premises and a cordon was in place as a safety precaution. They are working together to to ""ensure the structural stability of the property"". Wales and West Utilities said its engineers had isolated the house's gas supply and that following tests, it could confirm that the explosion and fire were not related to the mains network. Some 25 fire fighters tackled the blaze and crews will now carry out a ""full and meaningful investigation to determine the actual cause of the incident."" Neighbour Brian Jenkins, 64, said two air ambulances were at the scene. Llanbradach councillor Colin Mann told BBC Radio Wales: ""It was an absolute shock what happened. It just shows you can be living a perfectly normal life one minute and the next you can be caught up in the middle of that."" Blaze engulfs house after explosion.

"US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have finally shaken hands. But nobody knew exactly how it would play out.  Here we break down the images from an extraordinary morning to explain how each moment unfolded. The last finishing touches were made to the red carpet at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island with North Korean and US flags seen as a bold backdrop. It's safe to say that there has rarely if ever been a time when the North Korean and American flags flew side-by-side quite like this. It's a symbolic win for Kim, showing both players come together on equal terms. What you don't see in the picture is the media swarm on the other side of the photo, poised for that historic handshake. Almost as if they had rehearsed this moment, Mr Trump entered from the right and Mr Kim from the left. Trump and Kim make history with a handshake North Korea crisis in 300 words The three things North Korea wants Even before the two leaders were anywhere near each other, you can already see Mr Trump stretching out his hand - ready perhaps, to execute that famous grip he's known for. ""Nice to meet you Mr President,"" were the words spoken by Mr Kim upon meeting Mr Trump. It was a firm handshake of equals pressed upon each other, but one that was significantly shorter than Mr Trump is used to, lasting only seconds instead of the uncomfortably long ones the US leader usually gives. On Mr Kim's part, the handshake is a lot less dramatic than the one the North Korean leader gave South Korean President Moon Jae-in just a month ago, where he gripped Mr Moon's hand and led him over to the North Korean side of the border. And then Mr Trump ushers Mr Kim off the red carpet. He's seen in many pictures physically guiding or moving Mr Kim along, projecting an image that he's in charge and in control. ""Donald Trump placing his hand on Kim's back...[this] shows a bit of dominance,"" Manoj Vasudevan, a body language expert told BBC World News. ""You can see Trump leads the way a lot."" The duo are seen here in a fireside chat setting before they made their way into their one-on-one meeting. The moment, as it played out, was slightly awkward, with Mr Kim seen staring at the ground and Mr Trump fidgeting with his hands. Unlike the South Korean summit there was no scheduled ritual, it was almost a series of staged tableaux. ""Here they are sitting together, [but they aren't] making much eye contact,"" says Mr Vasudevan. ""You can see Kim Jong-un changing his position a few times and Trump tapping his fingers, [a sign of being] uncomfortable. There's no outward appearance of close rapport."" The awkwardness is understandable. Here's Mr Trump and Mr Kim walking (with Mr Trump one step ahead) towards their one-on-one meeting which lasted for 40 minutes. For Mr Trump, he's likely to credit any success in these talks to his ""maximum pressure campaign"". For Mr Kim, gaining an audience with a sitting US leader could be seen as a victory in itself - something which neither his father or grandfather could achieve. More importantly, it's cemented his legitimacy as a world leader. How the outcast became popular 'Stop romanticising a dictator' Human rights: What Trump and Kim won't talk about Both at the end of the bilateral talks and when the leaders gave a joint statement to the press, they shook hands again - a number of times. Without a clear sense of what exactly they have agreed to, perhaps gestures of goodwill summed up the day best. Reporting by the BBC's Yvette Tan.

"This video can not be played Trump Kim: The moment they shook hands Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have become the first sitting US president and North Korean leader to meet, an unprecedented development after a year of exchanging threats. The pair shook hands at a luxury hotel on Singapore's Sentosa island before proceeding to talks. After the summit the leaders signed a ""comprehensive"" document, promising a new relationship between the nations. They had been discussing defusing tensions and nuclear disarmament. The document commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang. The US had demanded ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation"". LIVE: Follow the latest summit updates Handshake moment explained in pictures Diplomacy on a plate: What did they eat? Trump-Kim summit explained There was also a commitment to build ""a stable and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula. ""I think both sides will be very impressed with the result,"" Mr Trump said at a signing ceremony with Mr Kim. The US president said more details would be provided at a press conference due shortly. Mr Trump said his meeting with Mr Kim went ""better than anybody could have expected"" The pair signed a document pledging they would work towards new relations Mr Trump spoke of a ""special bond"" with the North Korean leader and said he was ""absolutely"" willing to invite him to the White House. ""We've decided to leave the past behind,"" Mr Kim said. ""The world will see major changes."" Still, analysts remain divided on what the summit will ultimately achieve. Some see it as a propaganda win for Mr Kim, others a potential path to peace. Analysis: Laura Bicker, BBC News, Singapore The agreement the two sides have signed is vague and lacking in detail. It only commits the US and North Korea to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. There is no mention that the process should be verifiable or irreversible - which is what the US has been pushing for. There is no timetable to disarm North Korea nor is there any invitation for weapons inspectors to be allowed in. The US has said it will provide security guarantees without specifying what that might mean - or if that could involve the removal of some American troops based in South Korea. The two sides have promised to hold follow up talks and work on efforts to build a lasting peace regime. This could eventually result in a treaty to end the near 70-year war. It is at least a start. Something to build on. The summit began with a striking image, unimaginable just months ago. The two men walked towards each other and firmly gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags. Mr Trump patted Mr Kim's arm as they stood on red carpet and exchanged a few words before turning to face the gathered press. ""I feel really great. We're going to have a great discussion and will be tremendously successful,"" the US president said. Sitting alongside each other, ahead of a one-on-one meeting, the pair appeared relaxed against the odds. This video can not be played Trump: 'It's my honour' ""It was not easy to get here,"" Mr Kim said. ""There were obstacles but we overcame them to be here,"" and his counterpart responded ""That's true."" North Korean crisis in 300 words 'Stop romanticising a dictator' Singapore's taxi drivers on the summit The two men, accompanied only by interpreters, spoke for a little under 40 minutes. They were then joined by small delegations of advisors for a working lunch. From Washington the group included US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and security adviser John Bolton, and on Pyongyang's side, Mr Kim's ""right-hand man"" and former spy chief Kim Yong-chol, and foreign minister Ri Yong-ho. Over lunch they shared  a mix of Western and Korean dishes, including stuffed cucumbers and Daegu jorim, a soy-braised fish dish. This video can not be played Trump-Kim summit: The view from South Koreans The unprecedented event carries great potential prestige for each leader - but also, in the long run, a possibly catastrophic loss of face. For the moment Mr Trump will credit any successful outcome of talks to his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on North Korea, that tightened economic sanctions and threatened military action. Many believe that no matter what is achieved this will be the narrative. For Mr Kim, securing a stage with the US leader is seen as a victory in itself, something which neither his father or grandfather could achieve. Such a meeting has long been seen as a prize in the eyes of North Korea for the legitimacy it would confer on its leader. The leaders walk together at the Capella hotel in Singapore For decades, North Korea has been a pariah state, and now its latest hereditary leader is being treated as a world statesman. Last year, it would have been a rare sight to see a North Korean flag flying anywhere in Asia. Now, Mr Kim - who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced-labour camps - is meeting and greeting dignitaries. Kim: The new kid on the diplomatic block North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis On the eve of the summit, Mr Kim toured Singapore's tourist sites, waving to excited crowds and snapped a selfie with the city state's foreign minister. Tuesday's front page of North Korea's official newspaper featured the extraordinary scenes on display in Singapore, offering many in the country an unprecedented glimpse of their leader in a setting utterly at odds with their daily life. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un toured the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore This is an outcome that seemed unimaginable less than a year ago - when Mr Trump and Mr Kim exchanged streams of fiery insults - and North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of the international community. Who's pulling the strings of the N Korea breakthrough? Who are Kim's running bodyguards? How well has Trump prepared for Singapore? Mr Trump famously vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" if Pyongyang kept threatening the US. Meanwhile,Mr Kim has called Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"". But earlier this year North Korea showed a new openness to diplomacy and held direct talks with Seoul. The rapid improvement in relations between the North and South Korea - technically still at war - culminated with ahistoric leaders' summit in April. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on During this warming of relations between the two Koreas, Mr Trump stunned the world by accepting an invitation to meet Mr Kim.

"This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? US President Donald Trump says his historic talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that ended in a joint agreement were ""tremendous"". The signed document includes a pledge from Mr Kim to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. But in an extraordinary media conference later, Mr Trump announced details not in the paper. He said he would halt US military exercises in South Korea, something widely seen as a concession. How the summit unfolded Handshake moment explained in pictures Kim is a 'funny guy' - analysing Trump's quotes The meeting was the first time a sitting US president has met North Korea's leader, and caps a remarkable turnaround for the two. Last year saw the pair sling various insults at each other, while North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of the international community. For both men the meeting brought much to gain as well as considerable risk. Analysts say the meeting is seen by North Korea as a way of bringing legitimacy to a nation long regarded as a pariah. Should Mr Trump resolve the North's nuclear threat, he would have achieved something none of his predecessors came close to. The summit centred on nuclear disarmament and reducing tensions. The agreement said the two countries would co-operate towards ""new relations"", while the US would provide ""security guarantees"" to North Korea. Full text of the signed statement Did the summit rhetoric match reality? The summit's oddest moments On nuclear weapons, Mr Kim ""reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"". Observers say the document lacks substance, in particular on how denuclearisation would be achieved. However, speaking to reporters after, Mr Trump said: The US would suspend ""provocative"" war games it holds with South Korea. Mr Trump said he wanted to see US troops withdraw from the South. A spokesperson for the US forces said they had yet to receive any new guidance On denuclearisation, he said that Mr Kim had agreed to it being ""verified"", a key US demand ahead of the meeting Mr Trump said Mr Kim had also agreed to destroy a ""major missile engine testing site"" But he said sanctions would remain in place for now and argued ""we haven't given up anything"". Several reporters asked whether Mr Trump had raised the issue of human rights with Mr Kim, who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced-labour camps. The US president said he had, and did not retract his description of Mr Kim as ""talented"". This video can not be played Trump: ""The past does not have to define our future"" ""Well, he is very talented,"" Mr Trump said. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough. I don't say he was nice."" In a post-summit interview with ABC News, the president said he was confident that the agreement meant full denuclearisation. ""Yeah, he's de-nuking, I mean he's de-nuking the whole place. It's going to start very quickly. I think he's going to start now,"" he said. ""I think he trusts me and I trust him,"" Mr Trump added. North Korea crisis in 300 words Diplomacy on a plate: What did they eat? Trump-Kim summit explained Largely positive. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who held his own meeting with Mr Kim earlier this year, said the ""two Koreas and US will write new history of peace and co-operation"". A spokesman, though, also said the ""exact meaning and intention"" of what Mr Trump had said ""needs to be assessed"". China, North Korea's only major diplomatic and economic ally, also said the meeting created a ""new history"". The foreign ministry said sanctions on North Korea could be eased if it stuck to UN resolutions. Missed chance to discuss human rights, says defector How many dead US soldiers in N Korea? Who was Trump's nuclear uncle? Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praised President Trump's ""leadership and effort"", saying he supported North Korea's pledge on denuclearisation as ""a step towards the comprehensive resolution of issues around North Korea"". But Russia warned that the ""devil is in the detail"" and Iran said North Korea should not trust the US. Mr Trump recently pulled the US out of a nuclear deal with Iran. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Two years ago Barack Obama travelled to Cuba - and was roundly denounced by conservatives for breaking bread with totalitarian leaders and praised by liberals for his statesmanship. Now, with Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un, the tables have been turned. Mostly. On conservative Fox News and among Mr Trump's core supporters, the president was lauded for a historic diplomatic breakthrough. Among Democrats, there was more than a fair amount of concern that the president was engaging in a glorified publicity stunt with little chance of success. Republicans in Congress have been more measured. There was plenty of talk of ""historic first steps"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words, but concern over how the yet-to-be negotiated verification details will turn out. A few other conservatives expressed dismay at seeing the US and North Korean flags side-by-side, and viewed Mr Trump's solicitous manner and warm words for Mr Kim as too much, given his nation's history of human rights violations. ""Needless to say, we would've wrecked Obama for doing this,"" tweeted conservative blogger Allahpundit. Tuesday was the latest reminder that in just 16 months, US - and international - politics have been turned upside down. The summit began with a striking image, unimaginable just months ago. The two men walked towards each other and firmly gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags.

"This video can not be played Arron Banks laughs off the idea he is an ""evil genius with a white cat controlling the whole of western democracy"" Arron Banks has told MPs probing ""fake news"" his Brexit campaign had sometimes ""led people up the garden path"". But he said politicians were also guilty of spin and claimed Parliament was the ""biggest source of fake news"". The tycoon, who spent more than Â£6m on Leave.EU, said he had faced ""absurd"" claims of Russian conspiracies. Media committee chairman Damian Collins said it was ""difficult to know"" whether to take his evidence - and that of colleague Andy Wigmore - seriously. Leave.EU donor 'must explain Russia link' Arron Banks refuses to appear before MPs Facebook: Russian Brexit meddling 'minimal' Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum. It ran a ""disruptive"" campaign instead, Mr Banks told the committee, adding: ""We were not above using alternative methods to punch home our message or lead people up the garden path if we had to."" Mr Wigmore, Leave.EU's director of communications, said ""the piece of advice that we got, right from the beginning, was remember referendums are not about facts, it's about emotion and you have got to tap into that emotion"". He said the campaign had aimed to ""make fun"" of journalists and his role in it had been that of an ""agent provocateur"". Asked what the difference was between provocation and lies, he said: ""If you are trying to sell something or put a good case over to somebody you will tell the best story. If that's provocation - or a lie, if you want to call it that, yeah."" Bristol-based insurance tycoon who was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms One of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU and UKIP Born in Cheshire, the twice married father-of-five was a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage A Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at working class voters angry about EU immigration Mr Banks used his appearance before the Commons media select committee to hit back at claims he was involved in a conspiracy with Russian officials, saying there was ""not one shred of evidence"" for it. He was ""not an evil genius with a white cat controlling... western democracy"", he told the committee, accusing its members of being ""Remainers"" with a ""vested interested in trying to discredit the Leave campaign"". He then went on to attack the credibility of Brittany Kaiser and Chris Wylie, whistleblowers who had previously given evidence to the committee about controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica. He dismissed Cambridge Analytica as an ""advertising agency"" that ""did a little bit of politics on the side"". ""We had two or three meetings with them and it became clear to me that - as is true in a lot of politics - there is a lot of sizzle and sometimes not a lot of substance,"" he said. He also addressed revelations at the weekend that he had had two more meetings with the Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko than he had previously disclosed in his book on the referendum battle, The Bad Boys of Brexit. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage spoke at a Trump campaign rally in August 2016 The last of these was in November 2016, three days after Mr Banks, Mr Wigmore and the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage met Mr Trump in New York following his presidential election victory. According to details of emails reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer, Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore also discussed potential business opportunities in Russia including a proposal involving six gold mines. Mr Banks attempted to laugh off suggestions of a conspiracy over his meetings with Mr Yakovenko, telling MPs: ""I was hoping for a good lunch and that is what I did gain from it."" He added: ""The only thing we gave in the second meeting was the telephone number of the (Trump) transition team because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team."" He said Leave.EU had ""briefed the American security services on everything that transpired"". Mr Collins and his committee is looking into fake news in elections Mr Banks denied he was in Moscow in February 2016, as claimed by the Sunday Times, and produced passports containing Russian visas which he said proved he had been in Moscow twice in recent years, in March 2015 and October 2014. Mr Wigmore said he had first sought a meeting with Russian officials at a UKIP conference in his role as a then diplomat for Belize, a small central American nation and former British colony. ""His (Mr Banks') wife is also Russian. We thought it would be nice,"" he told MPs. Mr Wigmore said he had spoken to the ambassador about possible Russian investments in a banana farm in Belize and a port, owned by a bank belonging to former Conservative deputy-chairman and donor Lord Ashcroft. Mr Wigmore said the meeting with Mr Trump had not been planned and only came about because the US President's adviser Kellyanne Conway had asked if they ""wanted to go and see the boss"" when they were in Trump Tower, in New York. He claimed he gave the Trump transition team the phone number of Number 10 Downing Street, because the team had ""no relationship"" with the British government. Mr Banks - who was grilled by MPs for nearly three hours - refused to answer a final set of questions from Labour MP Ian Lucas, saying the session had overrun and he had a lunch appointment to go to. Mr Wigmore had kicked off the session by calling on Mr Collins to stand aside as chairman because he accepted hospitality from ""Putin's number one man in the United Kingdom"" and might be ""conflicted"". Mr Collins recorded a trip to Chelsea Football Club, owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, on his register of member's interests. He called the suggestion a ""nice try"" adding ""you might have better intelligence than me... I didn't know that Roman Abramovich was Putin's number one man in London"". In a statement after the hearing, Mr Collins said: ""Mr Banks and Mr Wigmore themselves put on the record that they frequently lie, exaggerate, misspeak and misunderstand. ""So it is difficult for the Committee to know if we should take all of their answers seriously when it comes to data sharing and misuse, campaign spending, and their meetings with high ranking Russian officials."" He said his inquiry would be writing to the pair to follow up some of the points they had made, adding: ""Our inquiry is about getting to the truth of these matters.""

The moment, as it played out, was slightly awkward, with Mr Kim seen staring at the ground and Mr Trump fidgeting with his hands. Unlike the South Korean summit there was no scheduled ritual, it was almost a series of staged tableaux. ""Here they are sitting together, [but they aren't] making much eye contact,"" says Mr Vasudevan. ""You can see Kim Jong-un changing his position a few times and Trump tapping his fingers, [a sign of being] uncomfortable. There's no outward appearance of close rapport."" The awkwardness is understandable. Here's Mr Trump and Mr Kim walking (with Mr Trump one step ahead) towards their one-on-one meeting which lasted for 40 minutes. For Mr Trump, he's likely to credit any success in these talks to his ""maximum pressure campaign"". For Mr Kim, gaining an audience with a sitting US leader could be seen as a victory in itself - something which neither his father or grandfather could achieve. More importantly, it's cemented his legitimacy as a world leader.

"Are we witnessing the making of Kim Jong-un as a new international statesman? Kim Jong-un has suddenly become the new popular leader in the political class of 2018. After years in isolation, he has emerged as a powerful player. Leaders from China, Russia, Syria, South Korea and the US have all met or are due to meet Mr Kim this year. They are literally lining up. Vladimir Putin has just extended an invitation for him to come to Vladivostock in September andSyria's President Assad has said he would also like to visit Pyongyang. ""We are witnessing the making of 'Kim Jong-un, international statesman',"" said Jean Lee, the former Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang. ""This is such a different international debut than we saw in 2010, when Kim Jong-un stepped forward as the unknown, baby-faced heir apparent. ""Now, with a proven intercontinental ballistic missile under his belt, Kim is stepping out as the leader of a country that sees itself as a nuclear power on par with the world's other nuclear powers, including the United States. "" Both President Assad (L) and Putin (R) have expressed interest in meeting Mr Kim (C) This is of course the kind of prize he was looking for when he accelerated his missile testing programme in 2017, asKen Gause, the author of North Korean House of Cards, points out in a recent essay,external. ""Kim Jong-un most likely came to the conclusion that the only way to ensure success on the diplomatic front was to escalate to de-escalateâ¦ North Korea would have to force its way to the negotiating table from a position of strength. "" But little did Kim Jong-un know he was going to get THE prize. A summit with the US president. It gave him the diplomatic street cred he was hoping for. And it also offered him an opportunity to say North Korea was open for business. North Korea crisis in 300 words Human rights: What they won't talk about ""Kim has kept himself at arm's length with the outside world for such a long time that foreign officials do tend to jump at the chance to meet him, if only to gain insight into who he is and what he wants for his country,"" says Jean Lee. And jump they have. Two things helped Kim Jong-un's new diplomatic outreach. South Korea elected a liberal president who campaigned with the promise to engage with North Korea. This allowed him to establish a relationship with his neighbour. Then came the invitation to the US president. Previous commanders-in-chief had wanted some kind of guarantees in place before a summit. But not Donald Trump. The unpredictable US president who'd spent a year threatening Pyongyang with a pre-emptive strike made a snap decision to agree to face to face talks. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies When Mr Kim walks out to greet Donald Trump in Singapore, it's worth remembering that in just six months he has gone from complete international isolation to being one of two leaders at the centre of one the world's biggest geo-political dramas. Trump and Kim: An on/off bromance Analysing Trump's letter to Kim Jong-un The North Korean spies who want to go home The summit itself has given Kim Jong-un political leverage. This new diplomatic strategy does not just arise from a position of strength, but also out of necessity. Having declared that his weapons programme was complete, Mr Kim announced that his main focus would be on the economy. To do that he needed to forge alliances and rebuild old friendships. First stop was, of course, China, North Korea's main trading partner. President Xi Jinping helped enforce Donald Trump's maximum pressure strategy at the end of 2017, cutting off vital supplies much to the disgust of Pyongyang. The state even turned away a Chinese envoy when he tried to visit at the end of last year. Mr Kim and Mr Xi were pictured together in an intimate setting But now Kim Jong-un has caught the travel bug. Two visits to China in under two months. First to Beijing and then to Dalian in early May where he took a stroll along the beach with President Xi and apparently talked trade. It had echoes ofhis historic meeting in April at the Korean border with the South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Just friends taking a walk, talking about the future of their two countries. Kim Jong-un has looked willing to engage in a way his father and grandfather never were. Mr Moon and Mr Kim embraced as the world looked on It's worth noting the timing of his China trips. Each visit was made just days before Mr Kim met the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A cunning strategic move which may have allowed him to play one off against the other. China is in favour of a slower approach to denuclearisation and would prefer sanctions to be lifted to keep North Korea's economy stable. Mr Kim can turn around to the US and say - look who I've got in my corner. He made a similar move using Moscow as leverage just last week. Former North Korean spy chief Kim Yong-chol was on his way to the United States withhis leader's rather large letter, when Kim Jong-un decided now was the time to welcome the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Pyongyang. It was the first visit by a senior Russian diplomat in over a decade. It may of course have been a coincidence, but Donald Trump wasn't happy about it. Mr Lavrov's visit was the first by a senior Russian diplomat in over a decade ""I didn't like the Russian meeting. I said what's the purpose of the Russian meeting? If it's a positive meeting, I love it. If it's a negative meeting, I'm not happy,"" he told reporters. He may have good reason not to be happy. Russia views itself as an alternative moderator in any denuclearisation discussions. It shares a border with North Korea and key economic interests. So if Washington thought North Korea was trapped in a corner, Kim Jong-un was sending them a message and parading his other options. Adam Mount from the Federation of American Scientists told me: ""Each new relationship provides leverage against American efforts to pressure the regime. Outreach to Beijing has made sanctions relief a virtual certainty, especially given that the Trump team has positioned itself as the one endangering a peace process. ""Growing indications of an alignment with Moscow are particularly worrisome. If they continue to expand, they could afford Pyongyang a variety of ways to break out of containment in the future."" It wasn't too long ago that Mr Kim was testing nuclear missiles Syrian President Bashar-al Assad's relationship with Pyongyang is one that may also worry the US and the UN. The North's state-run media agency said that he plans to make a visit to Pyongyang. It is an old alliance. The North established diplomatic relations with Syria in 1966 and sent troops and weapons to the country during the Arab-Israeli war in October 1973. A UN report leaked in February accused the North of making 40 shipments to Syria between 2012 and 2017of materials including acid-resistant tiles, valves and pipes that could be used to make chemical weapons. The international community will be now watching this particular alliance even more carefully. But not everything has gone North Korea's way. Pyongyang's vice-foreign minister last month issued a harsh statement which criticised US Vice-President Mike Pence as ""stupid"" and warned the United States that it faced a nuclear showdown if diplomacy failed. Most on the Korean peninsula know this is typical North Korean rhetoric and the South Korean administration has been very careful not to react to similar swipes. It was also perhaps utterly predictable after Mr Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton both compared nuclear disarmament in North Korea to Libya. Kim Jong-un: The king of Pyongyang What Trump and Kim won't talk about Trump and North Korea talks: The political gamble of the 21st century But the words rattled the White House. It gave Donald Trump ammunition to walk away and cancel the summit. I heard so many analysts from Washington on that night as I reported from Seoul wondering if Pyongyang would go on the offensive, maybe even test another missile. They didn't. Instead they attempted to take the moral high ground. There was a hastily arranged meeting with President Moon at the border to smooth things over with the South. Kim Jong-un hugged his neighbour - a gesture designed perhaps to portray a gentler side. He then despatched his right hand man to New York to try to get things back on track and wrote President Trump that now famous letter. This video can not be played US-North Korea: Trump gets an unusually large letter Some may have felt there was a whiff of desperation from the North Korean leader. Perhaps he seemed a little too eager to save his prized summit which he saw slipping away. But luckily for him, it paled in comparison to the daily dramas of the White House. And many wondered if Donald Trump really knew what he was doing. As sociologist Aidan Foster Carter tweeted: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former US state department official Joel Wit, who also founded the North Korea analysis site 38North, told a press briefing: ""This isn't a 'charm offensive', this isn't a sort of tactical trick. There is enormous momentum in Pyongyang behind what they're doing. I personally don't think it's because of sanctions. ""That may have played a small role.  But it's something they decided internally and it has to do with the size of their nuclear arsenal, the missiles, the desire for modernization of their economy.  All of these different issues have sort of come together at this moment. ""And I think what you need to do is pay attention to what the North Koreans are saying. It's not just propaganda.

"Theresa May is facing a week of potential rebellions in the House of Commons Tory MPs have been urged to rally round Theresa May ahead of a series of crucial parliamentary votes on Brexit. Former home secretary Amber Rudd and ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith called for ""discipline"" and ""unity of purpose"". Writing in Sunday's Telegraph,external, they said the EU Withdrawal Bill was key to delivering Brexit and any defeats would help Labour ""frustrate"" the process. But ex-chancellor Ken Clarke said Theresa May was being ""undermined"" by her ministers and had to be ""rescued"". Labour are urging Tory rebels to side with them in the Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday as ministers try to overturn more than a dozen amendments made by the House of Lords. EU withdrawal bill: the flashpoints ahead Sturgeon urges 'proper debate' on bill If enough Tory MPs decide to vote with Labour and other opposition parties, the government could be defeated on several key votes, including on amendments intended to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU and to give Parliament a decisive say over the final Brexit deal. This video can not be played Dominic Raab, Housing Minister: 'I'm reasonably confident we will get the legislation through' Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr that while it would be difficult for Tory MPs to rebel, they had a ""real chance to change the course of the Brexit negotiations"". But in a show of unity, Ms Rudd - a leading Remain supporter in the 2016 referendum - and Mr Duncan Smith, a vocal Brexiteer, said Labour would be quick to exploit any government setback. ""Jeremy Corbyn will do everything he can to stop us,"" they wrote. ""That includes cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends."" This video can not be played Ken Clarke: MPs should vote for a 'softer, sensible Brexit' In the joint article, the pair say the withdrawal bill is ""not about competing visions of the future but about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure"". Urging colleagues ""to demonstrate discipline and unity of purpose"", they said ""we cannot allow ourselves to become divided and risk losing the precious chance to go on implementing policies that transform lives"". Please upgrade your browser Housing minister Dominic Raab said he was ""reasonably confident"" the government, which will have the support of a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs and the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs, would prevail. Passing the withdrawal bill would be a ""turning point"" in the Brexit process, he told the BBC's Sunday Politics, as it would be the basis for a ""smooth transition"" after the UK leaves. Potential rebels had to think ""very seriously"" before defying the government, he added. Are rebels prepared to strike? By Susana Mendonca, BBC political correspondent Appeals for unity from two Tory heavyweights betray the degree of nervousness in the party With its small Commons majority, just a few backbench Tories siding with the opposition could lead to defeats for the government this week. What isn't clear is whether those backbenchers unhappy with the government's approach on the EU Withdrawal Bill will go as far as to strike the kind of blow that could destabilise a prime minister who's already struggling to keep her Cabinet together after a week of threats of resignations. The fact that two such high-profile polar opposites on Brexit - Remainer Amber Rudd and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith - have joined forces to urge their colleagues to vote with the government is a sign of just how worried some on both sides on the Conservative Brexit debate are about the prospect of Theresa May being weakened in EU negotiations, or even toppled. ""Better the devil you know"" is a phrase that comes to mind - as neither side wants to end up with a PM who leans more towards the type of Brexit they don't want. There are Tory backbenchers like Ken Clarke who think the only way to tame the more vociferous Brexiteers on the frontbench is for backbenchers to inflict a blow that they cannot ignore. So there will some rebels this week despite the warnings to toe the line - but will there be enough of them? The prime minister, who will address all Tory MPs on Monday, has accused peers of going ""far beyond"" their role with their amendments to the withdrawal bill. But former Chancellor Ken Clarke rejected suggestions Mrs May could be forced out if she was defeated - saying she would comfortably win any vote of confidence among Conservative MPs. ""We need to rescue the prime minister from this terrible treatment she is getting from key members of her cabinet,"" he told Sunday Politics. He suggested Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who criticised the government's strategy last week, and Brexit Secretary David Davis, who reportedly came close to resigning, were using ""Donald Trump methods"" to undermine the prime minister. The veteran europhile said MPs must take ""control"" of the Brexit process and he would back efforts to strengthen the terms of the ""meaningful vote"" that Parliament has been promised on the final deal. ""I know we have got to back the prime minister but kicking the can down the road for another month is hopeless,"" he said. Speaking earlier to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington accepted the parliamentary arithmetic was ""difficult"" but urged MPs to ""get behind"" the PM. But confirming the SNP would vote against the government on all the amendments,Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid the EU Withdrawal Bill as it stood was ""unacceptable"".

"US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has suffered  what doctors say was a ""very mild"" heart attack. He is expected to make a full recovery, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. President Trump first tweeted the news before his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.,external Mr Kudlow, 70, recently accompanied the president to a G7 summit in Canada that ended in disarray. ""Larry is currently in good condition at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and his doctors expect he will make a full and speedy recovery,"" Ms Sanders said. Mr Kudlow's wife, Judith, told the Washington Post that her husband was ""doing fine."",external Mr Kudlow joined the Trump administration earlier this year and has taken a tough stance on trade. The US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico on 1 June, setting the scene for a tense G7 meeting hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the weekend. The summit ended with Mr Trudeau vowing to press ahead with retaliatory tariffs and Mr Trump retracting his endorsement of the joint statement and lashing out at his host. Mr Kudlow has defended the new tariffs and said his boss should not be blamed for trade tensions. After the summit, Mr Kudlow told CNN that the president and his team had gone to the summit ""in good faith"" but that Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back."" Mr Kudlow was born in New Jersey and studied at the University of Rochester and Princeton's school of public and international affairs. His career in economics started with a junior position at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve. He moved to work as an economist for Wall Street firms and for former President Ronald Reagan in Washington, where he helped to make the case for the first round of 1980s tax cuts. In 1994, Mr Kudlow spoke to the New York Times about battling drug and alcohol addiction, saying he hoped his story would help others in the position. The problem had led to his resignation as chief economist from the Bear Stearns investment bank. Mr Kudlow, who calls himself a ""long-run optimist"", subsequently re-invented himself as a media personality, hosting radio and television programmes, including for the business news channel CNBC, where he remains a contributor.

"Almost three-quarters of women in seven UK cities never ride a bike for local journeys, despite having a positive perception of cycling, says a survey. More than 7,700 residents of Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Greater Manchester were surveyed for Sustrans. ""Most of our cities are failing to design roads and streets for women to cycle,"" the charity said. It says more dedicated routes would encourage people to ride bikes. The cities surveyed are so-called Bike Life cities - part of a UK-wide assessment of cycling. Twice as many men as women cycle at least once a week in the cities, the report said. This is despite 72% saying things would be better if people in general cycled more often and more than two-thirds (68%) believing their city would be a better place to live and work if more people cycled. What is stopping women from cycling? Lorries and potholes put people off cycling How to get into cycling - BBC Get Inspired guide The research found that many women simply do not feel safe cycling. Just 27% thought cycling safety was good in their city. ""There should be investment in on-road dedicated cycle lanes, protected from motor traffic, that get people to where they want to go directly and efficiently,"" said cyclist Verity Leigh, from Edinburgh. ""I've always cycled with my children on my bike from the time that they were babies. It's a practical thing for us, it's just a choice that makes our lives easier,"" Cerys Furlong, who lives in Cardiff, said. The report pointed to the success of Cambridge - which has the UK's highest level of cycling - and attributed it to low speed limits, extensive cycle routes and expensive parking. ""Evidence from the UK and beyond shows that when dedicated space for riding a bike is provided, alongside engagement programmes, the gender gap in cycling can be eliminated,"" Sustrans chief executive Xavier Brice said. The charity recommends prioritising women's road safety through protected routes and providing training programmes to enable more women to use bikes. Dr Rachel Aldred, a transport academic at the University of Westminster, said women ""too often have limited mobility"". ""Enabling women to cycle can open up opportunities and help make our society more gender equal and inclusive,"" she said. Earlier this month, a survey by charity Cycling UK suggested the most common reason people were put off cycling wassharing the road with large lorries. What is stopping women from cycling?

"This video can not be played The founder of Poundworld has told BBC Radio 5 live he's looking at a rescue plan. Poundworld's founder has said he is considering buying back some of the discount retailer's stores after it fell into administration on Monday. Christopher Edwards, 67, who sold the business in 2015 for Â£150m to TPG Capital, said the chain could be saved with fresh management. But he said no deal had been finalised and the discounter would only survive another two weeks without a buyer, putting some 5,100 jobs at risk. Mr Edwards founded the firm in 1974. Poundworld collapses into administration What's eating the pound shops? Administrators Deloitte were called in after the indebted chain failed to strike a rescue deal with another potential buyer, R Capital. Like many retailers, Poundworld has been battered by falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. But Mr Edwards, who started out running a market stall in Wakefield in 1974, said the current management team were most at fault. He said the management at Poundworld had ""not adjusted"" to rising cost pressures, caused by the weaker pound, and had ""lost their profit margin"". He also said a decision to introduce multi-price products after 20 years of only selling goods for a pound had confused shoppers. ""B&M Bargains hasn't gone, Home Bargains hasn't gone, Wilko hasn't gone,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""So for every store that goes down others are still thriving. It's about management style, that is what makes the business work."" Poundworld, which has 335 stores across the UK, expanded rapidly after the 2007 recession by targeting price-conscious shoppers. However, footfall has slumped over the last few years along with its sales. Losses for the financial year 2016-17 were Â£17.1m, up from Â£5.4m the year before. Mr Edwards said he felt ""sad and emotional"" about the firm's troubles, and had been negotiating to buy stores for the past six weeks. But he admitted he could not afford to do so alone and was looking for outside investors to back him. If a deal is struck, he said, he will look to renegotiate Poundworld's debts but admitted that getting the business back on track would be a ""task and a half"". ""I will know within two weeks if I can save the business,"" he told Radio 5 Live. ""And if no buyer is found by then, the firm will go to the wall."" Administrators Deloitte stress the stores will continue to trade as normal with no redundancies at this time. Investment company TPG, which still owns Poundworld, also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords and creditors agreed a restructuring last month. Born into a ""fairground family"" Mr Edwards, 67, spent his early years travelling the UK Founded Poundworld in 1974 and in the 1980s expanded into nightclubs The retailer really took off ""when a friend introduced us to importing from the Far East"" In 2015, Poundworld was sold to TPG Capital for Â£150m In 2016, Mr Edwards was parachuted into Poundstretcher by owners Crown Crest to help revive the business.

"MPs should not ""undermine"" the UK's position when they vote on the EU bill, Brexit Secretary David Davis says. Opening two days of debate, Mr Davis said a bid to give Parliament more control would tie ministers' hands and lead to a bad deal for the UK. MPs then accused each other of trying to ""wreck"" Brexit and, from the other side, being ""zealots"" who wanted to sideline Parliament. Earlier the government was hit by its first resignation over Brexit. As voting began in the Commons, the government defeated the first three amendments, which focused on Parliamentary scrutiny. And a late concession - believed to include offering a new Parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers - may have avoided defeat on the key demand for a ""meaningful vote"". Live updates: MPs debate EU bill changes Minister quits government over Brexit How big a problem is Lee's resignation for May? The Brexit amendments MPs are voting on Earlier, starting the Commons debate, Mr Davis told MPs the bill's ""primary purpose"" was to ensure a ""functioning statute book"" on the day the UK leaves the EU, 29 March 2019. The most tightly-contested amendment is likely to be the call for Parliament to decide what happens next if MPs decide they do not like the UK-EU Brexit deal. This video can not be played Stand up for what you believe in - Tory MP Mr Davis said this would represent a ""profound constitutional shift"" and that the government, not Parliament, should be in charge of international negotiations. Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh agreed, saying the change would amount to a ""wrecking of the will of the people"", and Sir Bill Cash said it was ""just a cover for a reversal of the decision"" to leave the EU. But pro-EU Conservative veteran Ken Clarke criticised ""real zealots"" who were trying to ""stop this Parliament playing any part in the process"". The government's offer to make a statement if the Brexit deal was not approved by MPs would amount to saying ""Oh House of Commons, get lost"", he claimed. This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow tells MPs not to be intimidated Another likely Tory rebel, Anna Soubry, criticised some of her Conservative colleagues, saying their ""life's ambition"" was to take the UK ""over the cliff to the hard Brexit"". Ms Soubry also raised threats made to MPs over the issue, saying one of her colleagues needed six armed protection officers when attending a public event. As the debate continued, the government tried to convince potential rebels to back down, with Solicitor General Robert Buckland offering to hold talks with one of them, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, on Wednesday. Mr Lee has called for a referendum on the final Brexit deal Phillip Lee has been a junior justice minister since July 2016, having first been elected as the Bracknell MP in 2010. Explaining the reasons for his resignation, he cited the government's opposition to the ""meaningful vote"" amendment, saying this position ""breaches fundamental principles of human rights and Parliamentary sovereignty"". He also raised concerns about the economic impact of leaving the EU, saying Brexit had turned out to be much more complicated than first thought. The UK should ""pause, extend or revoke"" the Article 50 process which formally triggered its departure from the EU, he said, calling for another referendum once ministers' chosen path becomes clear. Pro-EU campaigners hailed his resignation as significant in their calls for a referendum on the UK and EU's final Brexit deal. Brexit-backing former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was surprised, adding: ""I didn't realise he felt this strongly."" Mr Duncan Smith said the amendment giving more power to Parliament would be ""disastrous"" and allow the House of Lords to ""block the whole passage of Brexit"". This video can not be played Brexit Secretary tells Today the EU referendum is ""irreversible"" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the numbers were still ""rather dicey"" for the so-called meaningful vote amendment. It would mean ministers ""must follow any direction"" set by a House of Commons motion if Parliament rejects the final Brexit deal or negotiations run out of time. The government says this would bind the UK's hands in the negotiations. Brexit: All you need to know Why is the customs union so important? Flashpoints ahead for the Brexit bill Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said a Parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal did not give ""the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum"". Asked what would happen if MPs rejected the deal, he said there would be no time to restart negotiations, with the UK leaving the EU in March 2019. ""If they throw it out, well they throw it out,"" he said. Rebels have dismissed the government's amendment, a commitment by ministers to make a statement within 28 days should MPs vote down the package negotiated by Mrs May. Pro and anti-Brexit protesters demonstrated outside Parliament ahead of the votes A showdown over customs seems to have been averted after a compromise amendment was accepted by the government - which means it has agreed to report to Parliament by October on efforts to negotiate a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU after Brexit. The fallback position has won the backing of a cross-section of leading Tory MPs on either side of the Brexit argument, avoiding for now a showdown over calls - backed by the House of Lords earlier this year - for the UK to remain in a fully-fledged customs union with the EU after it leaves. Mr Davis said a ""great deal of progress"" had been made in negotiations, saying he was expecting both a withdrawal agreement and the ""substance"" of the UK and EU's future relationship to be finalised in October. He also described as ""nonsense"" reports he threatened to resign over the wording of last week's ""backstop"" plan to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? The EU withdrawal bill is the legislation aimed at ensuring the UK has a smooth transition out of the EU, and will mean EU law is no longer supreme in the UK. To avoid a sudden ""cliff edge"" on Brexit day, 29 March 2019, it would also convert existing EU law into UK law so the government and Parliament can decide at a later date which bits they want to keep or change. The House of Lords has put forward 15 specific changes to the bill, but the government wants to kill off most of these changes. However, numbers in the House of Commons are finely balanced, with the Conservatives not having a majority and needing the help of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get their way. On Monday, Mrs May told her MPs they ""must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week"". ""I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible,"" she said. ""But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined."" Please upgrade your browser Labour, which is backing 14 out of the 15 amendments, is urging Tory rebels to seize the chance to ""decisively shape the course of the negotiations"". Jeremy Corbyn's party is also divided on Brexit, with several MPs unhappy Labour is not backing a bid to keep the UK part of the EU's single market, like Norway. There is still a chance of a squeaky moment for the government, or having to rely on votes from some Labour MPs, on a move to give Parliament more power if MPs vote to reject the final Brexit deal. Sources tell me the numbers are still rather dicey for that so called ""meaningful vote"" amendment that will take place tomorrow. There are discussions ongoing among potential rebels about whether they should deploy their forces. Some of them believe, as they do on the customs issue, that they have the numbers to beat the government if they decide it's the right moment. Appeals for party unity in the last couple of days, and the compromise on customs seem to have had some sway. Read Laura's full blog Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"US President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has suffered  what doctors say was a ""very mild"" heart attack. He is expected to make a full recovery, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. President Trump first tweeted the news before his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.,external Mr Kudlow, 70, recently accompanied the president to a G7 summit in Canada that ended in disarray. ""Larry is currently in good condition at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and his doctors expect he will make a full and speedy recovery,"" Ms Sanders said. Mr Kudlow's wife, Judith, told the Washington Post that her husband was ""doing fine."",external Mr Kudlow joined the Trump administration earlier this year and has taken a tough stance on trade. The US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico on 1 June, setting the scene for a tense G7 meeting hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the weekend. The summit ended with Mr Trudeau vowing to press ahead with retaliatory tariffs and Mr Trump retracting his endorsement of the joint statement and lashing out at his host. Mr Kudlow has defended the new tariffs and said his boss should not be blamed for trade tensions. After the summit, Mr Kudlow told CNN that the president and his team had gone to the summit ""in good faith"" but that Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back."" Mr Kudlow was born in New Jersey and studied at the University of Rochester and Princeton's school of public and international affairs. His career in economics started with a junior position at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve. He moved to work as an economist for Wall Street firms and for former President Ronald Reagan in Washington, where he helped to make the case for the first round of 1980s tax cuts. In 1994, Mr Kudlow spoke to the New York Times about battling drug and alcohol addiction, saying he hoped his story would help others in the position. The problem had led to his resignation as chief economist from the Bear Stearns investment bank. Mr Kudlow, who calls himself a ""long-run optimist"", subsequently re-invented himself as a media personality, hosting radio and television programmes, including for the business news channel CNBC, where he remains a contributor.

It seems the historic summit has boosted President Trump's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize - at least in the eyes of the bookmakers. They have slashed the odds on him winning following the summit. Ladbrokes cut the odds from 10/1 to 6/4, and William Hill offered the same odds for Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un to win it jointly in the next couple of years. But Mr Trump wouldn't be the first US president to bag the award. In 2009, only a year into his term of office,US President Barack Obama wonfor ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"".

an invitation to the White House, no concessions on human rights, and no clear
concessions on a timeline or a process for denuclearisation."" ""For this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, for it to be
anything more than a reality TV handshake summit, thereâs going to need to be a
lot of hard work in the months ahead and Iâm concerned that the Trump
Administration isnât prepared to do that hard work,"" Mr Coons said in an interview with MSNBC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them.

They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends?

Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"Andrew Kim had a spot at the table in May for Pompeo's talks with Kim A US team of negotiators has been talking to counterparts in North Korea ahead of the showdown talks between the two leaders in Singapore. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has played a leading role in a number of working sessions that concluded on Monday. Their aim was to hammer out the vital questions and areas to discuss later. TheWashington Post reports that the two leaders,externalwill meet one-on-one before the teams of experts join them. As well as Mr Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton are expected to be there - he has already infuriated the North Koreans with his tough line. So who else will there be on the US side? Korean-American Andrew Kim is the head of the CIA's Korea Mission Centre. Mr Kim was born and raised in South Korea under the name Kim Sung-hyun, the Washington Post reported. He attended the prestigious Seoul High School, which boasts South Korea's national security adviser and intelligence agency head as alumni, before moving to the US during college. Andrew Kim (circled) arrives in North Korea with Mike Pompeo in May He worked with the CIA for the majority of his career, serving in Moscow, Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul. Mr Kim had retired, but the CIA brought him back to lead the new Korea Mission Centre last May. In the lead up to the summit, he seems to have become Mr Pompeo's right-hand-man for all things North Korea related - including planning strikes, a South Korean presidential adviser said. He has been described by South Korean and Japanese media as a ""messenger from hell"" due to his hawkish stance on North Korea. Veteran diplomat Sung Kim is the current US ambassador to the Philippines. He served as the ambassador to South Korea between 2011-2014 and was a US special envoy in the Six-Party talks. Ambassador Kim at a ceremony in the Philippines Mr Kim was born in Seoul but grew up in Los Angeles. As a diplomat, he served in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. During his time in Washington, he was the special representative for North Korea policy in Washington, director of the Office of Korean Affairs and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs. He recently led the US delegation to meet North Korean officials at the border to discuss talks, Reuters reported. A South Korean official told Reuters Mr Kim was ""capable, level-headed, cautious"", with a ""solid grasp of the issues and [he] knows North Koreans well"". A top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, he has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for the upcoming summits, according to the White House. The former Navy intelligence officer and State Department diplomat now serves as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs, and has been holding talks with North Korean delegates at the DMZ for weeks. Randall Schriver is a top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis In June he travelled to Pyongyang with Mr Pompeo. From 1994-98 he worked for the Pentagon on day-to-day relations with the Chinese military and bilateral relations with Taiwan. He previously served as president and CEO of Project 2049, a think tank specialising in Asian security issues. The native of the US state of Oregon has run in four triathlons, according to Armitage International consulting firm, which he co-founded. She is a Korean peninsula specialist on the White House National Security Council, which she joined in 2014 under former President Barack Obama. She was formerly a member of the Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research where she was tasked with North Korean nuclear policy. Allison Hooker, right, with Vice-President Biden at a nuclear security summit in 2016 In 2017, she was chosen by the White House to be part of the US delegation to the closing ceremony of the Olympic games in PyeongChang. However, she reportedly did not meet with any North Korean officials during her time there. In 2014, under President Obama, she travelled to North Korea with then-director of National Intelligence James Clapper to negotiate the release of two American detainees. During the brief trip, she also met powerful Korean General Kim Yong-chol. Ivanka was at the heart of the Winter Games diplomacy The wild card on the US delegation is the US president's own daughter, and White House adviser, who led the US delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics. The games, which were attended by North Korea, paved the way for these peace talks. During her time there, she sat in the stands beside the North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong. At one point the two women shook hands as cameras documented the moment. The absence of US First Lady Melania Trump from Singapore has only added to the speculation that Ms Trump may make a surprise appearance.

" It was a bitterly cold day in Pyongyang - 28 December 2011. Snow was falling hard as a long black Lincoln Continental car drove slowly through the streets. On the roof, on a bed of white chrysanthemums, lay the coffin of North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il. Vast crowds dressed in black lined the streets. They had to be held back by soldiers as they wept uncontrollably, beating their chests and calling out “father, father”. Beside the car walked the dead dictator’s son and successor Kim Jong-un. Just 27, he looked overwhelmed. He broke down in tears several times during the ceremony. Directly behind Kim walked his uncle Chang Song-thaek, considered to be the second most powerful man in North Korea. On the other side walked army Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun. These were the old men who would now wield power in Pyongyang. Or so many thought. In the 1950s Kim Jong-un’s grandfather Kim Il-sung created something unique in the communist world - North Korea’s one-man hereditary leadership. For nearly two decades Kim groomed his eldest son Kim Jong-il to succeed him. Wherever he went, the crown prince was at his side. In 1994, when the old man died, Kim Jong-il immediately took charge. But when he then died suddenly in 2011 his own son had barely begun his apprenticeship to become North Korea’s third Supreme Leader. Many experts now predicted the collapse of one-man-rule. They were soon to be proved wrong. Within months Chief of Staff Ri Yong-ho and Defence Minister Kim Yong-chun had both been dismissed. Ri’s whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. Then in December 2013 Kim Jong-un made his most dramatic move. His own uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was hauled from a party meeting, accused of treason and executed, with some unconfirmed reports even suggesting an anti-aircraft gun had been used. Between 2012 and 2016 Kim carried out the biggest purge seen in North Korea since the days of his grandfather. South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy has reported the execution of 140 senior military officers and government officials. Another 200 have been removed or imprisoned. Kim has removed anybody who stood in his way, replacing them with a younger cadre loyal to him. They are led by his own sister Kim Yo-jong, who in 2017 was appointed to the Politburo at the age of 30. Today no-one is in doubt who pulls the levers of power in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader. It’s a warm April afternoon in 2018 and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a wooden bridge in a forest glade in the middle of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea. Six years have passed since that bitterly cold day in Pyongyang. Kim is sipping tea and listening intently to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. The meeting is being broadcast live around the world. No-one watching can hear a word they’re saying. For half an hour many around the world watch transfixed by this mute conversation, trying to read every gesture. Just months before Kim had been test-firing missiles over Japan and threatening to rain fire on  Seoul and the US. Now he is sitting, smiling, deep in conversation with his sworn enemy. How does one reconcile this image with that of a man who was prepared to have his own uncle killed? There are so many questions. What does Kim want? Is this a bluff, a charm offensive? Or is Kim Jong-un now determined to take a different path from the one set out by his grandfather Kim Il-sung, and handed on to him by his father Kim Jong-il? The year is 1992 and at a villa in Pyongyang a very special birthday party is being held for an eight-year-old boy. Among the presents one stands out. It is a general’s uniform. Not a toy, but the real thing - a miniature but otherwise totally authentic uniform of a general of the Korean People’s Army. It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person” Other, much older generals arrive at the party and bow before the eight-year-old boy. His name is Kim Jong-un. The story of how this eight-year-old became “General Kim” was recounted to the Washington Post in an interview with Kim’s aunt in 2016.  Nearly two decades earlier Ko Yong-suk and her husband had defected to the West. They now live in quiet seclusion outside New York. In the interview Ko said that birthday party convinced her Kim Jong-un was being anointed as successor to his father Kim Jong-il. “It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,” Ko said. A few years later Ko Yong-suk was assigned to accompany Kim Jong-un when his father sent him to private school in Switzerland. She described the teenage Kim as hot-tempered and arrogant. “He wasn’t a troublemaker, but he was short-tempered and had a lack of tolerance. When his mother tried to tell him off for playing too much and not studying enough, he wouldn’t talk back, but he would protest in other ways like going on hunger strike.” Tiny snippets like these are virtually all we know of Kim Jong-un’s childhood.  It’s not much on which to build a picture of who he is and why he was chosen to succeed his father over his older brother Kim Jong-chol, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam. The first to predict Kim Jong-un’s rise to power may have been a Japanese sushi chef who goes by the alias of Kenji Fujimoto. During the 1990s Fujimoto became an unlikely member of the Kims’ inner circle. He made Japanese food for Kim Jong-il, and claims he was the young Kim Jong-un’s “playmate”. In 2001 Fujimoto returned to Japan and published his inside story.  In it he described his first encounter with Kim Jong-un, and his older brother Kim Jong-chol. “The first time I met the two young princes, they were both wearing military uniforms.  They shook hands with each of the staff. But when it came to shaking my hand, Prince Kim Jong-un gave me an icy glare. It was like he wanted to say, ‘We hate Japanese like you’. I will never forget his sharp stare. He was seven years old.” Kenji Fujimoto's book about his life with Korea's first family In a second book in 2003 Fujimoto wrote: “Kim Jong-chol is regarded as the most likely successor. But I doubt that very much. Kim Jong-il used to say, ‘Jong-chol is no good, he is like a girl’. His favorite is his youngest son, the second prince. Jong-un is very much like his father. He is even built like his father. But his existence has not been revealed to the public.” It was a remarkable prediction. At the time Kim Jong-un had not been introduced to the North Korean people, let alone the outside world. Most of his childhood was still a complete secret. When Choi Min-jun was 14, he was selected to join the most elite unit in the North Korean military - the Supreme Guard Command. Today he is a defector living in South Korea under an assumed name. We recently got a glimpse of the secretive unit that protects North Korea’s royal dynasty. As Kim Jong-un arrived for the summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April a group of tall besuited bodyguards were filmed running alongside his Mercedes limousine. These men were from the inner rank of the Supreme Guard Command, the most elite of the elite. Choi Min-jun had no chance of entering that inner circle. He was not tall enough. But more importantly he had the wrong family background. “I was not born into the highest rank of society,” Choi tells me, “so, I could not serve in the Supreme Leader’s personal bodyguard. Instead I was assigned to his combat unit.” For all its protestations of being a socialist state, North Korea has an elaborate and rigid caste system that classifies every person from birth. It is called Songbun. The website NKNews describes Songbun thus: “It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determines whether one is allowed to live in the capital, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive.” Crucially Songbun status cannot be changed. If your grandfather fought against the Japanese during the occupation of Korea you are considered “loyal”. If he worked for the Japanese colonial rulers you are an “enemy” and always will be. Choi Min-jun, North Korean defector Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them. And so Choi was sent to a combat unit. At the time his “status” did nothing to blunt his loyalty. “In North Korea, you are brainwashed from a young age,” he says. “I was taught that the Kim family are gods. And I believed it. “When Kim Il-sung made his new year address and said this year we must mine more coal, I said: ‘I will go to the mines!’ That's how naive and loyal to the Kim family I was.” Choi rapidly discovered the Supreme Guard Command was not there to protect the Kims from foreign enemies, but from their own people. “For the Kim family, everyone is a potential enemy,” he tells me. “The North Korean military, the General Staff Department, the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces as well as the entire North Korean people, they are all potential enemies.” Choi was trained to trust no-one, not even his own parents. As the Kim family’s paranoia grew so did the size of this personal security force. “When the Kim family saw the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the fall of the Soviet Union they were shocked,” he says. “They drastically increased the size of the Supreme Guard Command. Now it numbers almost 120,000 soldiers.” Like a medieval royal house, the Kim regime is jealous of its power and sees enemies all around. And like many royal families through the ages, it sometimes kills to protect its position. Choi’s own family were peasant farmers - they had not served the Japanese, but nor had they opposed them.

And like many royal families through the ages, it must sometimes kill to protect its position. On 12 February 2017, a group of friends gathered in a restaurant in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. They had come to celebrate the 25th birthday of an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah. Video from one of her friends' phones shows her smiling and blowing out a candle and singing. According to Aisyah’s account of the night, she told her friends she had exciting news. She’d landed a job on a TV reality show. Finally, she could escape the sleazy Kuala Lumpur bathhouse where she worked. Her friends toasted her: “You are going to be a star!” The next morning at Kuala Lumpur airport Siti Aisyah spotted her target, a rotund balding man in blue T-shirt and sports jacket. As he approached the check-in she ran up to him and splashed a liquid in his face. “What are you doing?” he spluttered in broken English. “Sorry,” she said as she ran away. According to Aisyah’s version of what happened - which has not stopped her being charged with murder by the Malaysian authorities - it was all just a prank for the TV show. Siti Aisyah, pictured after her arrest for the murder of Kim Jong-nam Sitting in a café a few metres away were a group of alleged North Korean agents. Apparently satisfied their mission had been completed, CCTV footage shows them walking to the departure gate and boarding a flight to Dubai. The rotund man was now starting to feel unwell. His face was itchy and he was finding it harder to breathe. Within minutes he was slumped on a chair unconscious. Airport staff called an ambulance. As it sped towards Kuala Lumpur his lungs filled with fluid and he drowned. The man’s passport said he was a North Korean diplomat called Kim Chul. In fact, the dead man was Kim Jong-nam, the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent - VX. Inhaling a drop the size of a grain of sand is enough to kill. Kim’s was a brazen killing and - despite North Korea denying any involvement - all the evidence seemed to point towards his younger half-brother in Pyongyang. But what was the motive? Their father Kim Jong-il had a complicated love life. He had two official wives, and at least three mistresses, with whom he fathered five children. Kim Jong-nam was the child of his first mistress Song Hye-rim. Kim Jong-un was the younger son of his second mistress Ko Yong-hui, a former actress born in Japan. The old dictator kept his mistresses and their children secret. They lived in secluded villas, isolated from each other. Though they shared a father, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un never met. As the oldest son, Kim Jong-nam was long considered Kim Jong-il’s most likely successor. But in 2001 he was arrested as he attempted to enter Japan on a fake passport. He had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland. The crown prince of North Korea was filmed being marched to a plane and expelled. For his father in Pyongyang it was a humiliation he could never forgive. Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent into exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Kim Jong-nam had been poisoned with a powerful nerve agent, VX.

Kim Jong-nam was removed from the succession and sent in to exile in China. Or so the story goes. But that is not the whole story. Yoji Gomi is a Japanese journalist who got to know Kim Jong-nam better than any other outsider. In repeated meetings in Beijing and Macau, Gomi gleaned something of his life story. 1975: Kim Jong-nam with his maternal grandmother “Kim Jong-nam was excluded from the succession before the Tokyo Disneyland incident,” he tells me. Gomi says that the breakdown in relations began after Kim Jong-nam returned from boarding school in Switzerland in the late 1980s. The experience of living for nine years in Europe had deeply affected him. During the 1990s North Korea was hit by a severe famine, euphemistically called “the arduous march”. The collapse of economic support after the end of the Soviet Union, and a series of devastating floods, left the country extremely short of food. Over four years between one and three million people died from disease and malnutrition. According to Gomi, Kim Jong-nam wanted his father to change North Korea’s economic system. He wanted Chinese-style reforms, allowing some private property and market reforms. 1981: Kim Jong Nam (seated, right) with his family “Kim Jong-il got very angry at him,” Gomi says. “He told Kim Jong-nam he must change his mind or he must go outside of Pyongyang.” Journalist Bradley K Martin agrees. He wrote the definitive biography of the Kim dynasty, a huge tome called Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. “Kim Jong-nam wasn’t rejected because he went to Disneyland,” he says. “The whole family goes around under false pretences. I don’t think his father was embarrassed. I think Kim Jong-nam said things about policy and the need to change policy and his father didn’t like it.” Kim Jong-nam was sent into exile in Beijing. [Kim Jong-un] was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons” The next in line should have been Kim Jong-il’s middle son Kim Jong-chol. But it appears he was never seriously considered. Instead he chose his youngest son Kim-Jong-un. According to Martin: “He was chosen by his father because he was the meanest and nastiest of the sons.” In other words, he had the best chance of surviving a brutal succession struggle and keeping the family business alive. He has certainly shown his ruthlessness. According to Gomi, once Kim Jong-il was dead, and Kim Jong-un took over, his half-brother began to get nervous. “After Kim Jong-il died Kim Jong-nam suddenly felt unsafe. The last time we communicated was in January 2012. At that time, Kim Jong-nam said to me, ‘My brother and the Kim dynasty will do something dangerous to me’.” Martin believes Kim Jong-un had his own brother killed. He has his own theory why. “It fits with the killing of [his uncle] Chang Song-thaek,” he says. “Chang was charged with planning a coup d’état. We [the Western media] ignored that. Then Kim Jong-un went after the brother. We have these reports that Chang went to China and said, ‘Let’s get rid of Kim Jong-un and put Kim Jong-nam in’. Kim thinks: ‘My uncle and my older brother are plotting against me and are in cahoots with the Chinese.’ It makes a certain amount of sense.” That is just a theory, but his further conclusion seems irrefutable. “There are now no further threats to his rule.  His internal challengers are gone.” Kim Jong-un now rules supreme. But what does he want for his small impoverished country? Statue at the base of the Juche Tower, Pyongyang In the summer of 1998, Kim Jong-un was back in North Korea, on holiday from school in Switzerland. He’d been out to the family’s huge summer compound beside the sea near Wonsan. Now he was on a train heading back to the capital, Pyongyang. Sitting with him looking out at the villages and rice paddies was Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto. In his 2003 book Fujimoto says Kim Jong-un told him: “Fujimoto, our country is behind in industrial technologies even compared with other Asian countries. We still have power cuts.” He says Kim then compared North Korea’s situation to China. “I heard that China has been successful in many ways. We have a population of 23 million people. China has a population of over a billion. How do they manage to supply power? It must be difficult to produce enough food for a billion people. We need to follow the example set by them.” If Fujimoto’s story is true then the young Kim Jong-un was expressing sacrilegious thoughts. Since 1955 the guiding ideology of North Korea has been Juche. The word is often translated  as “self-reliance”. It is Kim Il-sung’s “great contribution” to Marxist-Leninist thought. There is a vast memorial dedicated to Juche on the south bank of the Daedong River in Pyongyang. Making fun of it is not advised. But Juche is a myth. North Korea is not self-reliant and never has been. For its first 40 years the country was almost entirely dependent on Moscow for economic support. When the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea’s state-run economy fell apart and its people starved. In the midst of the famine North Korea’s people began to trade. Out of the chaos and collapse of the 1990s a new economy emerged. Unregulated and officially unrecognised, it nevertheless keeps North Korea’s people alive. The extent of this “black” economy became clear to me while interviewing a young defector in Seoul in 2012. South Korean President Park Geun-hye had just ordered the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Zone - just across the DMZ in North Korea. “When I heard the news, I called my father and told him to go to China and buy Choco Pies,” the young defector told me. This left me confused. “Sorry,” I said, “where is your father?” “In North Korea,” he said. “How do you call him?” I asked. His father, it turns out, has a Chinese sim card for his mobile phone. This is illegal and dangerous, but also common. Once a week he travels to the Chinese border, connects to a Chinese mobile network, and his son can call him. “And what about the Choco Pies?” I asked. South Korean companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial zone had been paying their North Korean workers, in part, with South Korean products. One of the most popular was Choco Pies. They were so popular they had become a kind of black-market currency in the North. Now that the Kaesong zone had shut, the black-market price for Choco Pies would sky rocket. So, he told his father to go to China and bring back as many boxes as he could carry, the profits would be good. At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back?"" I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.” “What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said. The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town. This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled: “The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear programme. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know. It doesn’t fit with what we know about him. He’s had years to do so if he wanted to. He has done showmanship like his father and his grandfather. ‘Let’s build monuments.’ Each has done the same thing. “I have seen no evidence the economy has really been reformed except for tacitly admitting that there is another economy – which it had to. Everyone would have died if it hadn’t been for the  ‘other economy’.” If Kim Jong-un is now intent on developing his country he needs sanctions lifted. He needs trade and massive investment. To get that, the US and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”,  his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? At a church on the outskirts of Seoul I met a very different defector. He was short with wide muscular shoulders, missing teeth, and a heavy accent my South Korean translator struggled to understand. “I was a smuggler,” he said. He described how his gang bribed North Korea border guards to leave a section of the border unguarded at night. They would then cross in to China carrying scrap metal and valuable minerals. “What did you smuggle back? I asked “All sort of things, food, clothes, DVDs, drugs, pornography,” he said. “Drugs and pornography are dangerous.”“What’s the most dangerous thing to smuggle out of North Korea?” I asked “If you take scrap metal from a Kim statue, that can get you shot,” he said The goods imported and smuggled from China are traded at large markets that have sprouted up in every city and town.This informal economy is working. A new class of monied entrepreneurs is reported to be buying property in Pyongyang. North Korea’s economy is growing. But there has been no ideological shift, nothing to indicate a fundamental change from the top. Then on 20 April this year, at a plenary session of the Worker’s Party of Korea, Kim Jong-un made a speech entitled:“The further acceleration of socialist construction as required by a fresh high stage of the developing revolution.” In it Kim declared a freeze on all further testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and a “new strategic line” that would focus on building North Korea’s economy. This speech has been taken by some observers as a signal that Kim Jong-un is ready to fulfil that promise he made on the train - to follow China’s example. One is John Delury from Yonsei University in Seoul. “The new strategy is economics first - 100% on the economy,” he says. “Kim is saying, ‘I'm really going to improve the economy. You're not going to have to tighten your belts again.’ “For the last five or six years it has been modest improvement but nothing breakthrough. Instead he's obviously been focused on the nuclear program. And so we're now seeing a pivot.” Others, like Bradley K Martin, are far less certain. “Is he seriously thinking he can transform this country? I don’t know.

To get that America and its allies will demand he give up his “treasured sword”, his nuclear weapons. Is that what he now intends? Early on the morning of 4 July 2017 a US spy satellite flying high above North Korea spotted activity at an airfield in North Pyongan Province. A huge 16-wheel “transporter erector launcher” (TEL) drove on to the airfield. It had a large missile on its back. Over the next hour US intelligence officers watched as the missile was erected and fuelled for launch.  During the operation they could clearly see a man strolling around the missile, smoking a cigarette. This story was told by Ankit Panda, the editor of The Diplomat magazine, who says it was leaked to him by an intelligence source. The man with the cigarette, so close to a rocket full of inflammable fuel, could only have been Kim Jong-un. Shortly after dawn the missile’s main engine fired and it roared skywards, flying nearly 3000km into space before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. Kim Jong-un was jubilant. Photos released later showed him smiling and hugging senior military officers. And there in his hand was the tell-tale cigarette. Pyongyang claimed the rocket was a new intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the US and that the launch was a 4 July gift to President Donald Trump. North Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons programme doggedly, at great economic cost and in the face of intense international pressure to desist. After coming to power in 2011 Kim Jong-un dramatically accelerated the North’s nuclear and missile programme, conducting many more ballistic missile tests over a shorter period of time than his father had. On 29 November last year it culminated with the launch of an enormous new missile, the Hwasong-15.  North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said the new missile was capable of carrying a “superheavyweight warhead” and striking the whole of the mainland US. The KCNA report said Kim Jong-un “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power”. Many outside experts agreed - Kim could now hit the US. It was just over a month between that declaration and Kim Jong-un’s 2018 New Year message in which he offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. That message was read by many in the outside world as a dramatic switch by Kim to engagement. But some very important questions remain: Why was Kim so determined to develop long range weapons capable of hitting the US? What is his nuclear missile arsenal for? How you answer these questions will determine whether you believe Kim wants “peaceful coexistence” with South Korea, and is prepared to negotiate an end to his nuclear programme, or not. At his recent summit with President Moon, Kim Jong-un called for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, and promised to halt all further tests and dismantle his nuclear testing facilities. But according to nuclear weapons expert Duyeon Kim,  of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, that does not mean Kim Jong-un is ready to unilaterally disarm - far from it. “He actually declared that it [North Korea] is a nuclear power,” she says. “That's what advanced responsible nuclear powers say. They don't have to test any more after about six nuclear tests. So Kim Jong-un is gearing up his persona, walking into these summits to be perceived as the leader of a normal powerful country on equal footing with the US.” There is a widely held view that North Korea’s nuclear weapons are defensive - that the Kim dynasty watched the fall of Saddam Hussein and then Colonel Gaddafi and decided that nukes are the only sure way of preventing US-led “regime change”. Critics of that view say neither Kim Jong-un, nor his father, ever needed ICBMs to protect themselves.  One is Prof Brian Myers of Dongseo University in Busan. In a recent speech to the Royal Asiatic Society, he said: “Our inability to stop this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons shows they were never vital to its security. If a North Korea without them were as vulnerable as Libya without them, it would have been bombed by 1998 at the latest.” The reason that didn’t happen is South Korea’s extreme vulnerability to counter-attack. The capital, Seoul, lies only 50km from the DMZ, well within North Korean artillery range. So if you were to accept Kim’s nuclear missiles aren’t needed for defence, what are they for? The answer according to Duyeon Kim is to achieve so-called decoupling - stopping the US from coming to South Korea’s aid if and when Pyongyang decides it’s time to “reunify”. “Based on the North's public statements and their actions and their private comments, it appears that the nuclear weapons are for both deterrence and for potential use in forceful unification. That's something that they've talked about openly and in private.” Myers agrees Kim’s nuclear weapons are about unification, but not necessarily by force. “North Korea needs the capability to strike the US with nuclear weapons in order to pressure both adversaries into signing peace treaties. This is the only grand bargain it has ever wanted. “The treaty with Washington would require the withdrawal of US troops from the peninsula. The next step, as Pyongyang has often explained, would be some form of the North–South confederation it has advocated since 1960. One would have to be very naive not to know what would happen next.” The idea that poor, backward North Korea could impose unification on a modern, wealthy and militarily more advanced South appears preposterous, and maybe it is. But Bradley K Martin says, however unlikely, it remains Pyongyang’s objective. “I have always believed reunification is their number one goal,” he says. “Many people say they gave up on it long ago - they know they can’t do it. Those people underestimate the confidence you can build if you have the attention of a whole people. If you are running the propaganda system in a one-man dictatorship you can convince people they can do anything.” I should be halfway to Beijing. Instead I am sitting in a drab room at a Pyongyang hotel. On the far wall portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il stare down. Right now, their expressions appear particularly malevolent. I feel dazed, shell-shocked. Across the table a slender man with a face lined by years of smoking is looking at me with an expression of calm menace. “This can all be over very quickly and you can go home,” he says, rotating an unlit cigarette in his right hand. “If you confess your crimes and apologise this will all be over. If you refuse, things will get much worse.” An hour before, I had been at Pyongyang airport preparing to board a flight to Beijing. Now I am facing hours, possibly days, of interrogation. My crime, according to my crinkle-faced interrogator, is “insulting Marshal Kim Jong-un”. The pit of my stomach turns cold. This is a serious offence. I’m not sure how I’ve done this. Nor, it becomes clear, is my interrogator. It doesn’t matter. My guilt has been decided elsewhere. Now he must get my confession. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes detained in Pyongyang As the night wears on the team changes and the threats become more frightening. A new interrogator stares at me with cold, malevolent eyes. “I am the one who investigated Kenneth Bae,” he says. “I think you know what that means.” I do. Kenneth Bae is a Korean-American pastor who was sentenced to 15 years hard labour by North Korea. He served 735 days before a deal was done for his release. Paik Hak-soon My interrogation was terrifying, but also surreal. I had been invited to Pyongyang to cover a visit by three Nobel laureates. Then I was detained and  threatened with prison because the regime didn’t like what I’d written. To me this seemed counter-productive. But I had fundamentally failed to understand my assigned role - to uncritically present North Korea’s version of the truth to the outside world. I had transgressed, I had become an enemy. Weeks later in Seoul a senior North Korean defector explains. “Your crime was not just to criticise Kim Jong-un, but where you did it,” he says. “In his own capital.” He is certain the only person who could have approved my detention, and release, was Kim Jong-un. “You were very lucky to get out,” he says. Prof Paik Hak-soon is the director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. He also thinks I was lucky to get away with “only” being expelled. “Kim’s identity is that of a king,” he says. “His sense of self-esteem does not allow any criticism or opposition from others. Any person or country that challenges or opposes him, faces retaliation without fail.” North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners for minor transgressions. Kim Jong-un has a particular penchant for it. Since 2011, 12 foreign nationals and four South Koreans have been held by Pyongyang. Three months before my detention in 2016, a young American tourist, Otto Warmbier, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour for stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel wall. His punishment seemed out of all proportion to his alleged crime. US citizen Otto Warmbier, pictured under arrest in North Korea Warmbier was eventually returned to the US with severe brain damage, and died a few days later. Most observers think his case is unusual. American captives are rarely physically abused - they are too valuable. For Pyongyang, US detainees are pawns in a cynical diplomatic game. They force the US government to enter into long negotiations, and finally to send a high-profile envoy to seal the release in person. Former US President Jimmy Carter was one. In 2009 former President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to bring back two detained US journalists. David Straub is a retired US diplomat who accompanied Bill Clinton on that trip. ""The North Koreans basically demanded Bill Clinton come and that was the only way that they would return the two journalists,"" he says. “It was clear that North Korea just wanted to have a photograph of Kim Jong-il with Bill Clinton, so they could show their people and the world and feel good about having forced the US to bend to their will."" But what Kim Jong-un really wants isn’t an ex-US president. He has always wanted the real thing - face-to-face negotiations with a sitting US president. On 9 May, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang, his second trip in a little over a month. He met with Kim Jong-un, and was handed three US citizens held in North Korean custody. The longest held was Kim Dong-chul, a 65-year-old Korean-American businessman who’d been in North Korean custody for 952 days. President Trump had asked for the three to be freed as a condition for holding a summit with Kim Jong-un. As he greeted the freed detainees at Andrews Airforce Base the US president declared: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Such hyperbole showed how eager Trump was for a first ever summit with the North Korean leader.

"Andrew Kim had a spot at the table in May for Pompeo's talks with Kim A US team of negotiators has been talking to counterparts in North Korea ahead of the showdown talks between the two leaders in Singapore. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has played a leading role in a number of working sessions that concluded on Monday. Their aim was to hammer out the vital questions and areas to discuss later. TheWashington Post reports that the two leaders,externalwill meet one-on-one before the teams of experts join them. As well as Mr Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton are expected to be there - he has already infuriated the North Koreans with his tough line. So who else will there be on the US side? Korean-American Andrew Kim is the head of the CIA's Korea Mission Centre. Mr Kim was born and raised in South Korea under the name Kim Sung-hyun, the Washington Post reported. He attended the prestigious Seoul High School, which boasts South Korea's national security adviser and intelligence agency head as alumni, before moving to the US during college. Andrew Kim (circled) arrives in North Korea with Mike Pompeo in May He worked with the CIA for the majority of his career, serving in Moscow, Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul. Mr Kim had retired, but the CIA brought him back to lead the new Korea Mission Centre last May. In the lead up to the summit, he seems to have become Mr Pompeo's right-hand-man for all things North Korea related - including planning strikes, a South Korean presidential adviser said. He has been described by South Korean and Japanese media as a ""messenger from hell"" due to his hawkish stance on North Korea. Veteran diplomat Sung Kim is the current US ambassador to the Philippines. He served as the ambassador to South Korea between 2011-2014 and was a US special envoy in the Six-Party talks. Ambassador Kim at a ceremony in the Philippines Mr Kim was born in Seoul but grew up in Los Angeles. As a diplomat, he served in Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. During his time in Washington, he was the special representative for North Korea policy in Washington, director of the Office of Korean Affairs and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs. He recently led the US delegation to meet North Korean officials at the border to discuss talks, Reuters reported. A South Korean official told Reuters Mr Kim was ""capable, level-headed, cautious"", with a ""solid grasp of the issues and [he] knows North Koreans well"". A top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, he has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for the upcoming summits, according to the White House. The former Navy intelligence officer and State Department diplomat now serves as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs, and has been holding talks with North Korean delegates at the DMZ for weeks. Randall Schriver is a top aide to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis In June he travelled to Pyongyang with Mr Pompeo. From 1994-98 he worked for the Pentagon on day-to-day relations with the Chinese military and bilateral relations with Taiwan. He previously served as president and CEO of Project 2049, a think tank specialising in Asian security issues. The native of the US state of Oregon has run in four triathlons, according to Armitage International consulting firm, which he co-founded. She is a Korean peninsula specialist on the White House National Security Council, which she joined in 2014 under former President Barack Obama. She was formerly a member of the Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research where she was tasked with North Korean nuclear policy. Allison Hooker, right, with Vice-President Biden at a nuclear security summit in 2016 In 2017, she was chosen by the White House to be part of the US delegation to the closing ceremony of the Olympic games in PyeongChang. However, she reportedly did not meet with any North Korean officials during her time there. In 2014, under President Obama, she travelled to North Korea with then-director of National Intelligence James Clapper to negotiate the release of two American detainees. During the brief trip, she also met powerful Korean General Kim Yong-chol. Ivanka was at the heart of the Winter Games diplomacy The wild card on the US delegation is the US president's own daughter, and White House adviser, who led the US delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics. The games, which were attended by North Korea, paved the way for these peace talks. During her time there, she sat in the stands beside the North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo Jong. At one point the two women shook hands as cameras documented the moment. The absence of US First Lady Melania Trump from Singapore has only added to the speculation that Ms Trump may make a surprise appearance.

"This video can not be played Trump Kim: The moment they shook hands Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have become the first sitting US president and North Korean leader to meet, an unprecedented development after a year of exchanging threats. The pair shook hands at a luxury hotel on Singapore's Sentosa island before proceeding to talks. After the summit the leaders signed a ""comprehensive"" document, promising a new relationship between the nations. They had been discussing defusing tensions and nuclear disarmament. The document commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang. The US had demanded ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation"". LIVE: Follow the latest summit updates Handshake moment explained in pictures Diplomacy on a plate: What did they eat? Trump-Kim summit explained There was also a commitment to build ""a stable and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula. ""I think both sides will be very impressed with the result,"" Mr Trump said at a signing ceremony with Mr Kim. The US president said more details would be provided at a press conference due shortly. Mr Trump said his meeting with Mr Kim went ""better than anybody could have expected"" The pair signed a document pledging they would work towards new relations Mr Trump spoke of a ""special bond"" with the North Korean leader and said he was ""absolutely"" willing to invite him to the White House. ""We've decided to leave the past behind,"" Mr Kim said. ""The world will see major changes."" Still, analysts remain divided on what the summit will ultimately achieve. Some see it as a propaganda win for Mr Kim, others a potential path to peace. Analysis: Laura Bicker, BBC News, Singapore The agreement the two sides have signed is vague and lacking in detail. It only commits the US and North Korea to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. There is no mention that the process should be verifiable or irreversible - which is what the US has been pushing for. There is no timetable to disarm North Korea nor is there any invitation for weapons inspectors to be allowed in. The US has said it will provide security guarantees without specifying what that might mean - or if that could involve the removal of some American troops based in South Korea. The two sides have promised to hold follow up talks and work on efforts to build a lasting peace regime. This could eventually result in a treaty to end the near 70-year war. It is at least a start. Something to build on. The summit began with a striking image, unimaginable just months ago. The two men walked towards each other and firmly gripped each other's hands in front of US and North Korean flags. Mr Trump patted Mr Kim's arm as they stood on red carpet and exchanged a few words before turning to face the gathered press. ""I feel really great. We're going to have a great discussion and will be tremendously successful,"" the US president said. Sitting alongside each other, ahead of a one-on-one meeting, the pair appeared relaxed against the odds. This video can not be played Trump: 'It's my honour' ""It was not easy to get here,"" Mr Kim said. ""There were obstacles but we overcame them to be here,"" and his counterpart responded ""That's true."" North Korean crisis in 300 words 'Stop romanticising a dictator' Singapore's taxi drivers on the summit The two men, accompanied only by interpreters, spoke for a little under 40 minutes. They were then joined by small delegations of advisors for a working lunch. From Washington the group included US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and security adviser John Bolton, and on Pyongyang's side, Mr Kim's ""right-hand man"" and former spy chief Kim Yong-chol, and foreign minister Ri Yong-ho. Over lunch they shared  a mix of Western and Korean dishes, including stuffed cucumbers and Daegu jorim, a soy-braised fish dish. This video can not be played Trump-Kim summit: The view from South Koreans The unprecedented event carries great potential prestige for each leader - but also, in the long run, a possibly catastrophic loss of face. For the moment Mr Trump will credit any successful outcome of talks to his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on North Korea, that tightened economic sanctions and threatened military action. Many believe that no matter what is achieved this will be the narrative. For Mr Kim, securing a stage with the US leader is seen as a victory in itself, something which neither his father or grandfather could achieve. Such a meeting has long been seen as a prize in the eyes of North Korea for the legitimacy it would confer on its leader. The leaders walk together at the Capella hotel in Singapore For decades, North Korea has been a pariah state, and now its latest hereditary leader is being treated as a world statesman. Last year, it would have been a rare sight to see a North Korean flag flying anywhere in Asia. Now, Mr Kim - who runs a totalitarian regime with extreme censorship and forced-labour camps - is meeting and greeting dignitaries. Kim: The new kid on the diplomatic block North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis On the eve of the summit, Mr Kim toured Singapore's tourist sites, waving to excited crowds and snapped a selfie with the city state's foreign minister. Tuesday's front page of North Korea's official newspaper featured the extraordinary scenes on display in Singapore, offering many in the country an unprecedented glimpse of their leader in a setting utterly at odds with their daily life. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un toured the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore This is an outcome that seemed unimaginable less than a year ago - when Mr Trump and Mr Kim exchanged streams of fiery insults - and North Korea conducted several ballistic missile tests in defiance of the international community. Who's pulling the strings of the N Korea breakthrough? Who are Kim's running bodyguards? How well has Trump prepared for Singapore? Mr Trump famously vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" if Pyongyang kept threatening the US. Meanwhile,Mr Kim has called Mr Trump ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"". But earlier this year North Korea showed a new openness to diplomacy and held direct talks with Seoul. The rapid improvement in relations between the North and South Korea - technically still at war - culminated with ahistoric leaders' summit in April.

"This video can not be played Footage of the scene following the explosion Five people have been taken to hospital after an explosion and fire at a house in Caerphilly county. Emergency services were called to Dan-Y-Darren in Llanbradach at about 17:30 BST. An eyewitness said the front door ""blew off the house"". One casualty has been flown to hospital in Birmingham while paramedics took three people to Morriston Hospital in Swansea and one to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. All five suffered burns, but the extent of their injuries is not yet known. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service group manager Jason Evans said 25 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze. ""On arrival, crews were faced with a well developed fire and a number of casualties being assisted by neighbours at the scene,"" he said. ""Crews have worked hard to ensure the fire has been contained to the property of origin but additional support is being provided to neighbouring residents. ""Fire investigators from Gwent Police and South Wales Fire and Rescue Service are working together with local building control officers to ensure the structural stability of the property, and to carry out a full and meaningful investigation to determine the actual cause of the incident."" A spokesman for Wales and West Utilities gas network added: ""We are supporting the emergency services and working with them to investigate the cause of the explosion."" Neighbour Ken Lloyd, 66, said he came out onto the street after hearing a bang. ""Then there were a couple more explosions. It was frightening because we didn't know what was causing it,"" he added. Another neighbour, Brian Jenkins, 64, said: ""I was out in my back garden and we saw black smoke going up and then it turned white. We also heard popping."" Mr Jenkins, who lives nearly 200m (650ft) away, also said two air ambulances were at the scene.

"United Airlines said flight UA971 had been diverted due to a ""potential security concern"" A transatlantic flight has been diverted to Shannon Airport in Ireland, after what is understood to be a bomb threat was found inside the plane. United Airlines said flight UA971, from Rome to Chicago, had been diverted due to a ""potential security concern"". Irish police have confirmed a message was found inside the plane. There are reports in Irish media that it was found in a toilet and handwriting samples have been gathered from passengers. The 207 passengers and 11 crew members disembarked the Boeing 767-330 at Shannon in County Clare at about 14:15 local time.

"US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sign an agreement in Singapore North Korea ""commits to work towards the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" but analysts say it has not made specific commitments Mr Trump later defends what he has achieved and stuns observers by saying the US will stop war games with South Korea that infuriate the North He says Mr Kim agreed to destroy a ""major missile engine testing site"" and that sanctions won't be lifted until progress is made on denuclearisation The summit is the first time a sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader Anna Jones, Andreas Illmer, Yvette Tan, Heather Chen, Minji Lee, Helier Cheung, Tom Spender, Kevin Ponniah, Max Matza and Gareth Evans We are closing our live coverage of the historic talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Both leaders have signed an agreement following the summit in Singapore. Here's what we know: You can read our full story here. China's foreign ministry announced the US would be suspending military exercises with South Korea before President Trump's press briefing, the BBC's Paul Danahar says.

It seems the historic summit has boosted President Trump's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize - at least in the eyes of the bookmakers. They have slashed the odds on him winning following the summit. Ladbrokes cut the odds from 10/1 to 6/4, and William Hill offered the same odds for Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un to win it jointly in the next couple of years. But Mr Trump wouldn't be the first US president to bag the award. In 2009, only a year into his term of office,US President Barack Obama wonfor ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". The US ambassador to Nato, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has told BBC Newsnight that ""there has to be verification"" on denuclearisation, following the joint agreement. But she praised the two leaders' first meeting, calling it ""very strong"". This video can not be played 'Verification is key' says US ambassador President Trump's translator, longtime state department employee Lee Yun-hyang, was at times the only woman in the room during the negotiations between the US and North Korea. According to reports in Korean media, she has worked for the US full time since 2009 and has translated for George W Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. She also was at Mr Trump's side whenhe met with the South Korean president,externalin May and when he greeted the US citizens who were released from North Korea last month, Quartz reports. The 61-year-old's counterpart, North Korean Kim Ju-song, had previously met Mr Trump when he accompanied general Kim Yong-chol on his visit to the US in preparation for the summit. The handshake between President Trump and Kim Jong-un was viewed by millions and represented the summit's major set piece. We've looked back on some of history's most significant handshakes and why they mattered. This video can not be played Ten handshakes that shook the world The Air China aircraft that Kim Jong-un arrived in has departed Singapore, according to a flight tracking website. A second plane, likely carrying North Korean officials, has also left. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The path that led to this historic summit has been complicated and unpredictable, as has the relationship between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. We've distilled the complex saga into 300 words.  Kim Jong Un watches the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who serves on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, argues that ""Kim Jong-un walked away from Singapore with exactly
what he wanted â the pomp, circumstance and prestige of a meeting with the
President of the United States â while making no specific commitments in
return"". Delaware senator Chris Coons added: ""This was a dream outcome for Kim Jong-un... legitimacy on the world stage,
an invitation to the White House, no concessions on human rights, and no clear
concessions on a timeline or a process for denuclearisation."" ""For this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, for it to be
anything more than a reality TV handshake summit, thereâs going to need to be a
lot of hard work in the months ahead and Iâm concerned that the Trump
Administration isnât prepared to do that hard work,"" Mr Coons said in an interview with MSNBC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

the stability of a region vital to global economic growth and home to thousands

It's still only 08:00 local time in California, and Americans are still waking to learn of the historic meeting in Singapore. In LA's Koreatown neighbourhood, a colourful mural depicting a possible visit of Kim to the US has gone up. At the Santa Monica pier, a pair of impersonators have been attracting loads of attention in recent days, as anticipation of the talks built up. Koreatown residents watch the talks at a noodle restaurant A man skates by a mural in LA's Koreatown neighbourhood Impersonators at the Santa Monica pier The Republican Chairman for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, just sent us this statement. ""Protecting America from North Koreaâs nuclear threats is an urgent
priority, and Iâm glad the president is seeking peace through diplomacy. Kim
Jong-Un has gained much from step one, including an apparent promise from the
president regarding important US-South Korea defensive military drills."" The California congressman adds that he is looking forward to a ""detailed briefing"" on the talks, and that ""congress has an important oversight role in this process"". ""Kim Jong-Un should not receive a dime of relief until he fully and
verifiably denuclearises,"" he concludes.  ""Resolving this 65-year old
international challenge will take a great deal of hard work,"" Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said minutes ago on the floor of the US Senate. He says that he supports the goals, as outlined in the joint statement, but adds that ""if North Korea does not prove
willing to follow through, we and our allies must be prepared to restore the
policy of maximum pressure."" ""Today, I
congratulate the president on this major step, and share his hope that it will
begin a process that leads to an historic peace."" Trump tells Voice of America, the US government-sponsored news network, that Kim ""liked"" him. ""I think he liked me and I like him. And I understand the past and, you know, nobody has to tell me - heâs a rough guy. He has to be a rough guy or he has been a rough person."" The interviewer, Greta Van Susteren, says: ""But he's starved them. He's been brutal to them. He still loves his people?"" ""Look, heâs doing what heâs seen done, if you look at it,"" says Trump. ""But, I really have to go by today and by yesterday and by a couple of weeks ago because thatâs really when this whole thing started."" Allow Twitter content?

Asked what his message is for the North Korean people directly, Trump says: ""Well, I think you have somebody that has a great feeling for them. ""He wants to do right by them and we got along really well. We had a great chemistry - you understand how I feel about chemistry. Itâs very important."" ""I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry, no matter what you do you just donât have it. We had it right from the beginning, I talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.""

Did Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un strike a win-win deal at their summit, or was it just a Kim win? There is further reaction from Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who takes issue with President Trump's description of Kim Jong-un as ""talented"". ""Well, he is very talented,"" Mr Trump said. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough. I don't say he was nice.""

"China is Pyongyang's only ally, and Washington's most powerful rival As the US and North Korea prepare for their historic summit, China is the elephant in the room. Beijing is Pyongyang's only significant, long-standing ally, as well as Washington's most powerful, long-term strategic rival. That gives it a huge role in determining whether or not any agreement reached between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un can be turned into success. As those two leaders hog the limelight, here are three key questions about the powerful player lurking off stage. In a word, stability. Answered the other way round, what China most definitely doesn't want is any more nuclear brinkmanship on its border. It knows only too well Pyongyang's paranoia. It mistrusts Washington's wildcard president. And it genuinely fears another war of words leading to military miscalculation and escalation. The meeting the world's been waiting for How outcast Kim became popular Human rights: The issue they won't talk about With that in mind, a return to diplomacy and dialogue has sometimes seemed like an end in itself for Beijing. But while China's patience with North Korea has been seen to be wearing thin in recent years, it is still an old ally, and America is still a common strategic rival. It is likely to be far more pragmatic about the possibility of Kim Jong-un unilaterally negotiating away his hard-won nuclear deterrent. And if Mr Kim is able to win any concessions from Mr Trump - any shift in the US military posture on or around the Korean peninsula for example - China will see an advantage for itself of course. Some. China accounts for up to 90% of North Korea's trade with the outside world. But China has not forced North Korea to the negotiating table. This video can not be played Barbed wire and smuggled crabs: Watching North Korea from China Beijing may have signed up for the toughest sanctions ever against its neighbour, but it did so arguing, with some logic, that the more economically isolated Pyongyang becomes, the more the regime is incentivised to pursue its strategy of nuclear deterrence. Kim Jong-un is off to Singapore on his own terms and for his own strategic reasons. Instead, China's sanctions enforcement serves mainly Chinese purposes. The goodwill generated can be traded in its wider, geopolitical contest with America. And it has the limited, but still useful effect of reminding North Korea that it can't ignore Chinese interests entirely. The effect is limited, of course, because North Korea knows that China fears an economic collapse on its border much more than it fears the nuclear status quo. It's is a classic case of the tail wagging the dog. Remarkably, President Xi and Chairman Kim met for the first time just three months ago,and they've met again since. Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un have now met twice The two meetings came only after the Trump-Kim summit was announced. Was this flurry of diplomacy, some analysts wondered, a sign that China was desperate not to be sidelined? There are suggestions that the sanctions are suddenly easing a bit. And Donald Trump has also hinted that China has begun meddling. ""I will say I'm a little disappointed"", he said, ""because when Kim Jong-un had the meeting with President Xi... I think there was a little change in attitude from Kim Jong-un. So I don't like that."" For China, success will be anything - a treaty, a roadmap, a warm handshake and a vague plan - that keeps the dialogue going. From its perspective, the most significant thing about the young North Korean leader is not any ambiguous talk of denuclearisation, but his fledgling, domestic economic reforms. Last month, according to the Chinese foreign ministry, a senior North Korean delegation visited Beijing ""to learn about the achievements of China's domestic economic development"". This has always been China's preferred model. Could the recent demolition of North Korea's nuclear test indicate that the country is moving away from its status as a isolated pariah state? It would not be a disaster, perhaps, from China's point of view to see North Korea (with its limited nuclear stockpile) locked into a never-ending set of disarmament negotiations while Chinese businesses get on with the job of building infrastructure and expanding trade. It's the ""Chinese dream"" made for export; stability through prosperity, with of course a good measure of lasting authoritarianism thrown in. Zhao Tong is a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre in Beijing. ""Regardless of how much nuclear progress is made during the summit, China has a more important long term strategic goal,"" he told me. ""Which is to help North Korea grow its economy and transform itself from isolated pariah state into a more normal and more open country."" But if the summit runs off the rails, if there's a return to the US talk of limited military strikes, China may push on with its plan anyway. North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea has its bomb and is now clearly in statesman mode. Displays of North Korean ""restraint"" would not be lost on China and if talks collapse, it would be likely to point a finger of blame not at Mr Kim, but at Mr Trump. ""If the United States walks out of the summit and goes back to the maximum pressure campaign, China would blame the United States for the failure of diplomacy,"" says Mr Zhao from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre. ""And if the US shows any willingness to launch a military strike to disarm North Korea it's possible I think China would try to mobilise its own forces to send a signal of deterrence against Washington."" China is waiting in the wings. The Singapore summit, one way or another, is likely to increase its influence. How Kim the outcast became popular What crosses the China-North Korea border?
