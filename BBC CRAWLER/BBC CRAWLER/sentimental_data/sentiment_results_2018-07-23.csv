"More than 950,000 antidepressants have been prescribed to children since April 2015 The number of antidepressants prescribed to children in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland has risen over the past three years, figures obtained by BBC's File on 4 reveal. In England, there was a 15% rise. Scotland saw a 10% increase. And in Northern Ireland the number rose by 6%. In total, there were 950,000 prescriptions issued between April 2015 and March 2018. Experts have linked the rise to waits for specialist mental health services. Antidepressants should prescribed to children onlyunder close supervision,external. NHS England, NHS Scotland and the Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland all say they are committed to improving child mental health services. NHS Wales was unable to provide prescription figures because it does not hold the data requested. The figures were obtained by Freedom of Information requests and relate to a group of powerful antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The total number of prescriptions rose from 290,393 in 2015-16 to 330,616 in 2017-18. The steepest increase was seen in the youngest patients, those aged 12 and under, where the number of prescriptions rose on average by 24%, from 14,500 to almost 18,000. Mental health charity Young Minds links increases in antidepressant prescriptions to the length of Camhs waiting times Dr Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said:  ""Currently only one in four children and young people are treated for their mental health problems. ""The fact that prescriptions for antidepressants are rising could reflect a slow but steady move towards treating everyone who is unwell. ""But the importance of giving children access to psychological therapies cannot be overstated. ""What we don't know from today's data is why these antidepressants are being prescribed, and how. ""It is vital that they are being used judiciously, monitored carefully, and the risks and benefits of taking them are assessed in each individual case."" The mental health charity Young Minds says waiting times for specialist child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) have been increasing too, making it difficult for families to get support. Marc Bush, chief policy advisor at Young Minds, said: ""The government recently suggested that the average waiting time for general access to Camhs is around 12 weeks, which is a long time to be in distress. ""And that is why front-line professionals are turning to prescription pads, because they're thinking, 'I'm seeing someone in front of me in crisis with a level of distress I don't want to leave them with - how do I offer them some kind of alleviation from that?'"" In rare cases, antidepressants can trigger thoughts of suicide and self-harm in children. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) hasclear guidelines,external: Prescriptions should be written by a child psychiatrist within Camhs, not GPs Antidepressants should be offered only concurrently with psychological therapies The patient must be monitored to check for adverse reactions However, File on 4 has heard concerns these guidelines are not always followed. Reece Burrowes, 17, killed himself soon after being prescribed the antidepressant Sertraline Reece Burrowes, 17, was found dead in a park in south-east London on 6 December 2015, days after being prescribed an antidepressant called Sertraline by his GPs. Although the inquest into Reece's death recorded a verdict of death by suicide and no blame was assigned to Reece's doctors or Sertraline, File on 4 has been told several of the NICE prescribing guidelines were not followed by doctors. Reece's stepfather, Simon Banks, said: ""There are NICE guidelines, which you know in theory they should follow, but I know one of the concerns is that their thinking, 'If I do refer them to Camhs, there's potentially a waiting list.' ""From what we've gone through, our view would be don't give the medication, and wait. ""But I can imagine it's a very difficult call for the doctor to make."" Dr Shruti Garg, a Camhs consultant at the Manchester Foundation NHS Trust, said problems with young people transitioning out of Camhs services could also be leading to increases in prescription rates. ""Camhs services across most parts of the country cover only up to the age of 16 - adult mental health services start at 18, so there is a gap for the provision of services across these services."" The Department of Health in England told the BBC it had pledged Â£1.7bn to transform Camhs. This, it said, would help to provide greater access to a wider range of therapies, although there would still be patients who would benefit from antidepressants. In Scotland, Minister for Mental Health Clare Haughey said young people's mental health was a priority and Â£5m has been invested to create a taskforce to improve Camhs services. The Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland said the vast majority of referrals accepted into Camhs were seen within nine weeks and it was currently planning to spend an extra Â£1m on Camhs projects.

"Millions of ""just about managing"" families are no better off today than those in 2003, new research from the Resolution Foundation indicates. The remarkable income stagnation for so many reveals that the economy has been failing to generate income for people over many years despite record levels of people in work. In 2003, households on the lower half of incomes typically earnt Â£14,900. In 2016/17 that figure had fallen to Â£14,800, the research shows. Both figures are adjusted for inflation and housing costs. There are over eight million low and middle income households, just under half of which have children. And it is not just poorer households which have been facing a pay squeeze. On average, incomes for all households in 2017/18 increased by just 0.9%, the lowest rise for four years and less than half the average between 1994 and 2007, just before the financial crisis. For the poorest third of households, incomes actually fell by up to Â£150 in the last year. The Resolution Foundation report said that surveys revealed that over 40% of low to middle income families feel they would be unable to save Â£10 a month and over 35% would be unable to afford a holiday for one week with their children. ""We appear to have a picture of generalised stagnation for many, with lower income households actually going backwards,"" the Resolution Foundation's Living Standards Audit says. ""The apparent falling away of the bottom from the middle in 2017/18 represents a disturbing new development. ""This pattern has clear implications for poverty - captured by the number of people living in households with incomes below 60% of the median [the middle figure of a set of income figures ranked from high to low]. ""There are good odds that 2017/18 delivered a notable increase [in poverty]. ""Relative child poverty may have risen to its highest rate in at least 15 years, despite high levels of employment."" ""Child poverty"" is calculated by the number of under-16s living in a household that earns less than 60% of the average income. The big questions are why the income stagnation has happened and what can be done about it. On the ""why"", research by the Foundation - which was set up to look at the problem of low incomes - reveals that the economy has struggled to create wealth for people in work. Although employment rates are high, which is good for those in work, many of the jobs are lower paid. That's because people who are moving from unemployment into employment, such as single parents, tend to take jobs towards the lower end of income levels. Once in jobs there is also a lack of ""progression"" into higher paid jobs. Productivity levels for the whole economy - the ability to create more value for every hour somebody works - have also been poor since the financial crisis. Rather than investing in new innovations - such as computer technology or robots which could increase the amount people produce - firms have been holding onto cash to get them through the tougher economic conditions. What are called ""non-wage costs"" have also increased. This video can not be played The former prime minister says there's a 'real risk' of a rise in child poverty in the UK. Businesses now have to pay more into employees' pensions and, for larger firms, have to pay costs such as the apprenticeship levy to encourage better standards of training. Managers have also been criticised for being too conservative about taking on new ways of working. Benefit cuts since 2010 also affect lower income households far more than those on higher incomes. Put those factors alongside the poor economic growth the UK has been experiencing, along with many other developed Western economies, since 2008 and the reasons behind the living standards problem become clearer. Improving productivity is key to helping people out of poverty When it comes to solutions, the key is productivity. Economists argue that once in work, people should be encouraged to apply for promotions, increasing their skill levels and their pay. Firms should be encouraged to invest in innovations to make their firms more efficient and better able to create wealth for every hour worked. Better economic growth, which leads to higher incomes, is reliant on a number of factors - certainty about the future (in relatively low supply at present because of the Brexit process); global growth (Britain is an exporting nation so the better growth is elsewhere, the better for the UK); and investment in better and higher-value skilled jobs (which means focusing on education and skills and making managers better at exploiting opportunities that are available). Without a firm focus on such issues, the Resolution Foundation report reveals that, over the next decade, it is likely that ""just about managing"" families are likely to remain just that.

"Colin Brazier's wife of 20 years, Jo, died from breast cancer Sky News presenter Colin Brazier has asked people not to wear bright colours at his wife's funeral, telling mourners to ""leave their Hawaiian shirts at home"" and wear black. Writing a piece inthe Spectator,,externalhe said he was ""ill at ease"" with some of the modern conventions surrounding funerals. The father of six said making a funeral a colourful celebration was ""unfair on children"". His wife, Jo, died earlier this month. The rise of the happy funeral More choose budget funerals, says Dignity Basic burial costs rise 77% in eight years In his article, published on Saturday, Mr Brazier said he does not plan to deliver a eulogy at his wife's funeral and has ""politely asked"" friends and former colleagues to wear ""black please, if you don't mind"". He wrote: ""It's unfair on children to insist that a funeral should mean rejoicing in a life now passed. ""Maybe grown-ups can handle the cognitive dissonance required in 'celebrating' a life rather than, you know, being all morbid. But I seriously doubt children can."" He added that wearing black gives people a ""licence"" to get upset, and to ""treat a funeral like Ascot's Ladies Day"" not only trivialises death but moves the spotlight of consolation away from the family. He said there is ""nothing funky about turning death into a fashion parade and a free-for-all of self-realisation"", adding it can ""inhibit the necessary catharsis of the grieving process"". ""The old stuff - the black and the solemn - works because it distils the wisdom of ages,"" said Mr Brazier, who is a practising Catholic. Jo Brazier, Mr Brazier's wife of 20 years, died from breast cancer aged 55 on 6 July. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He had previously asked for prayers for her on Twitter and also thanked a group of singers who had visited her hospice. Her funeral is to be held next month. People sent their condolences to the Sky News journalist on social media, with many thanking him for his ""moving"" article and offering ""another perspective"". According toa YouGov poll published in 2016,,externalwearing black is now only seen as a requirement at funerals by 22% of people. Among those polled, 45% think wearing other colours are fine as long as they are dark and sombre, while 29% believe any colour is appropriate to wear for a funeral. Anda survey of 2,000 people by ICM in 2015suggest 54% wanted their funeral to be a ""celebration of life"". Professor Douglas Davies, director of Durham University's Centre for Death and Life Studies, said it is not known whether wearing black rather than colourful clothing can help the grieving process. But he said having a ""cultural agreement"" on the emotion at an event would be expected to help mourners. ""There would be a sense of togetherness, the togetherness in the shared grief symbolised in the uniformity of dressing,"" he said. Professor Davies, one of the leading experts in the history, theology and sociology of death, said the trend towards less-traditional funeral dress has emerged in the last 15 years. He said it has developed alongside the motif of a funeral as a ""celebration of life"", which he suggests is associated with the drop in people believing in life after death. Funerals are now less a discussion of heaven and more of a retrospective look at the person's identity, he explained. The tradition of wearing black to mourn became familiar by the mid-19th century. When Queen Victoria wore black for the rest of her life after the death of Prince Albert, she ""set the royal seal on black"", said Professor Davies. Nowadays, according toDebrett's,external, black is still the usual colour of mourning, but dark colours like grey or navy blue are acceptable. Debretts also suggests that dressing modestly and smartly is more important than unbroken black.

"This video can not be played ""The flames were chasing us into the water"" - survivor At least 74 people have died in wildfires in the Attica region around Athens, in Greece's worst fire disaster in more than a decade. Flames fanned by strong winds devastated the seaside village of Mati, devouring homes and cars. The coastguard said it and other ships rescued almost 700 people who had fled to the coast, and pulled 19 survivors and four bodies from the sea. A local mayor told the BBC there are fears the death toll could rise to 100. Mati is located in the Rafina region which is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Rescuers there found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, trapped just metres from the sea. Rafina's Mayor Evangalos Bournos told the BBC the village had ""disappeared"". He said more than 1,000 buildings had been destroyed or damaged - his own home among them. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts How wildfires start and how to stop them Hundreds of firefighters have been battling the blazes and the authorities are seeking international assistance. A fire brigade official confirmed the latest death toll. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of national mourning. Smoke over a suburb of Athens By Kostas Koukoumakas, Mati What is happening here in eastern Attica is a black hell. After I passed by hundreds of burning cars and houses earlier today, I reached the yard where police said so many people had been found dead. I could see some of them lying on the ground as fog covered the place and a toxic smell spread through the atmosphere. Most of them were tourists who had tried to find refuge but did not make it. ""I am calling my cousin but he does not respond,"" said Spiros Hatziandreou, who visited the spot. I could see flames in the trees and on the electricity poles all around. After that, police blocked access to everyone except rescuers. Fire swept through the village 40km (25 miles) north-east of Athens on Monday and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday. Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Your global guide to coping with heatwaves Desperate families trying to reach the safety of the sea were trapped by walls of smoke and flame. Others died in buildings or cars. After the 26 bodies were found in an open space, Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said: ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced."" Dimitri Piros, director of medical services for Ekav, Greece's nationwide ambulance service, told the BBC people had suffered horrific injuries because of the speed of the fire. The blaze struck like a flamethrower, he said, causing both smoke inhalation and skin burns. Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who did manage to reach harbours or beaches. ""Thankfully the sea was there and we went into the sea, because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water,"" said one survivor, Kostas Laganos. ""It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'"" George Vokas, whose family escaped by sea but whose house and cars were burnt, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. ""We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,"" he said. This woman in Mati was trying to find her dog on Tuesday Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. Greece country profile Prime Minister Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services had been mobilised. A spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Georgia Trismpioti, told the BBC some people had lost everything. ""The death toll rises every hour, many people lost their loved ones, many people lost their houses, lost everything, and they will need long-term support in order to recover,"" she said. Greece has asked other European countries for helicopters and additional firefighters to help tackle the fires. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, and Spain and Cyprus have offered Greece assistance, but with temperatures set to soar again, they are in a race against time to get the fires under control.

"This video can not be played Nukes, Trump Towers and human rights - what might peace look like between the US and North Korea? North Korea appears to have begun dismantling part of a key rocket launch site in the country's north-west. Satellite images of the Sohae station seen by US-based monitoring group 38 North suggest Pyongyang is complying with a promise made to the US in June. US President Donald Trump said North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un had vowed to destroy an engine test site, but did not specify which one. Pyongyang has maintained that Sohae is a satellite launch site. But US officials suspect that it has been used to test ballistic missiles. The satellite imagery appears to show the dismantling of facilities at North Korea's Sohae site During a landmark meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last month, the two leaders signed a deal to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"".

It follows comments from the US president last week that there was""no time limit"" for North Korea to denucleariseand no need to rush the process. But according to recent reports based on US intelligence leaks, North Korea might secretly still be continuing its weapons programme. Those reports indicate that North Korea's only official nuclear enrichment site at Yongbyon is being upgraded, and that the country was stepping up enrichment at other secret sites. The reports cannot be independently verified, but have been deemed accurate by respected North Korea watchers. North Korea has carried out a total of six nuclear tests, the most recent of which took place in September last year. The North has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear programme, and claims that it has developed an intercontinental ballistic missile that is able to reach as far as the continental US.

"This video can not be played Fires have spread easily in hot, dry weather Forest fires raging across Sweden as far north as the Arctic Circle have prompted authorities to ask for international assistance. On Wednesday afternoon, 44 fires were burning from Lapland in the far north to the southern island of Gotland. Hot weather and persistent drought are the main causes, and the national weather service has issued fire warnings for almost the entire country. Italy and Norway have both dispatched firefighting aircraft to help. Sweden said Italy had sent 13 people in two Canadair CL-415 ""waterbombers"", each of which can carry 6,000 litres of water at a time. Norway's national broadcaster NRK, meanwhile, reported that 10 helicopters had been despatched to aid its neighbour - six on Tuesday and another four on Wednesday - despite the risk of similar fire outbreaks in Norway itself. The wildfires have raged in parts for days and without a break in the hot dry weather they have shown little sign of stopping. Many people have been evacuated from their homes in Sweden, while others have been told to shut off all ventilation to keep smoke outside. Fire chief Britta Ramberg told Swedish media the fire in JÃ¤mtland was ""the largest and spreading the fastest"". Official advisories said that this blaze grew from 1,600 hectares to 3,000 on Tuesday alone, and that firefighters had been unable to contain it. Many firefighters were being recalled from holiday to join the operation. Above Karbole, where fires have burned since the weekend, smoke blotted out the sun Nine important public warnings have also been issued - a record number - as temperatures have hovered near or exceeded 30C for an extended period. ""The last time we saw wildfires of this calibre was 12 years ago,"" a rescue officer in the popular winter tourist town of Jokkmokk told AFP. Sos Alarm, the emergency number operator in Sweden, said its services were stretched because of the fires. It said it was also getting higher numbers of calls from people enjoying the long sunny spell who had run into trouble while swimming, boating or biking. Stockholm Fire Department shared this picture, showing the location of each of the fires across the country as of 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Wednesday: Allow Facebook content?

"Firefighters battle fires in Spain The UK, Greece, Spain, France and the US. Just some of the places around the world battling wildfires in recent days and weeks. Firefighters have been grappling with flames that can claim lives and destroy homes. Thousands are trying to evacuate and reach safety. Over the years, wildfires have become more frequent, widespread and intense, and 2022 has seen some countries -including the UK- record their highest temperatures in decades. Experts believe this is due to the long-termimpact of climate change. Is Europe set for its worst wildfire season? Then and now: The burning issue of wildfires Are wildfires getting worse? A fire needs three things: fuel, oxygen and heat. Firefighters often talk about the fire triangle when they're trying to put out a blaze. Flames in France ravage the forest On a hot summer's day when drought conditions peak, something as small as a spark from a train wheel can ignite a raging wildfire. Sometimes, fires occur naturally, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, most wildfires are caused by human carelessness. Arson, campfires, discarding lit cigarettes, not burning debris properly, and playing with matches or fireworks are often blamed. Devastating fires have blazed in California Once it's started, a wildfire can spread due to the wind, being on a slope or because of fuel. A view of the devastation of fires in the UK ""Where a slope is going upwards at a 10% gradient that would double the speed of the fire, if it's 20% it would quadruple the speed of the fire,"" Rob Gazzard, technical advisor to the Forestry Commission tells Newsbeat. ""That's because it's pre-heating the fuel above it. So if a fire is going up a mountain it will go very fast."" Firefighters gestures as they work to extinguish a wild fire Fuel includes everything from trees, underbrush and dry grassy fields to homes. The more fuel there is, the more violently the fire will burn. Plus if it's really dry - like it has been in most of those countries - the fire it creates is much more difficult to control. Quite a lot, actually. Low rainfall causing a drought, searing hot temperatures and wind all make the perfect recipe for a wildfire. A wildfire in Slovenia burned for days Remember the heat in the fire triangle? The sticks, trees and underbrush on the ground get hot from the sun, then very dry. As it gets even hotter those ""fuels"" can ignite and that's why wildfires tend to rage in the afternoon, when temperatures are at their highest. It's all about removing the fuel because you can't control the weather. Aircraft dropped water on wildfires in Italy Fire experts use wildfire prediction tools which look at the wind speeds, slopes, the fire's direction and fuel to work out how to put out the blaze. ""You go hours or days ahead of the fire and remove anything that can fuel it using bulldozers, tree harvesters, hand tools,"" says Rob. ""You then create a fuel break [basically a big trench] around the whole of the fire. Then you can win and suppress it really effectively."" People had to flee wildfires that raged in Greece We tend to get them in England and Wales, as well as parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland near urban and rural areas. Fires here are generally smaller than those around the world because our temperatures aren't as extreme as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada or United States. But they can still bedamaging and hard to tackle. A wildfire recently broke out on Dartford Marshes ""According to the government's climate change risk assessment, wildfires are predicted to increase in the United Kingdom by 30-50% by 2080,"" says Rob. According to amajor report by the UN, the effects of climate change are even more severe than previously thought. The report warned that increasingly severe weather patterns that could fuel wildfires, and heatwaves and droughts will become more common if action is not taken soon. In the UK, there is even a practice guide on preventing wildfires. This involves choosing to plant less flammable trees in places where they're less likely to set on fire and harvesting them regularly. A version of this article was previously published in 2021.

"Now that the dust has settled on the Trump-Kim summit, it is worth taking a moment to assess what, if anything, was achieved. President Trump certainly does diplomacy differently. This was his event - in his view, his success - and as far as he is concerned, the North Korean nuclear problem is well on the way to resolution. But few of the best analysts of US policy towards the Koreas - or, indeed, of US security policy more generally - believe that Mr Trump emerged the winner. The prevailing view is that it was the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un who departed with more tangible gains. The real beneficiaries of the Singapore Summit may be Pyongyang and Beijing. Earlier this week, I caught up with Dr Sue Mi Terry, Senior Fellow for Korea at the Washington DC think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Speaking at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, she had come to give her verdict on the summit outcome. She said that she had been left with ""no answers, only questions"". She began by talking about her efforts to put aside her own prejudices and scepticism. On frequent visits to South Korea before the summit, she kept on hearing optimistic predictions. Experts and officials insisted that Mr Kim was ""different""; that he had an interest in the West; that he was set to rule for a long period of time and thus, once having completed his nuclear programme, might indeed be willing to take his country in a different direction. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: Win-win, or a Kim win? Dr Terry said she remained sceptical but was prepared to give this argument a chance, pending the outcome of the Kim-Trump meeting. But even set against her own ""low expectations"", she says she was ""floored"" by what actually emerged. She could not believe that after two visits by the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang and all the negotiations surrounding the on, off, on again' summit, the Trump team was able to emerge with quite so little. Did the summit rhetoric match reality? US lays out terms for N Korea sanctions relief Six odd moments from the Trump Kim summit Indeed, she says that she thought that North Korea would give more, if for no other reason than to silence the sceptics and convince them that the 'Kim is different' narrative really held water. She was singularly unimpressed by the wording of the joint statement. ""Working towards denuclearisation"" is a weaker formula, she noted, than earlier disarmament commitments made by previous North Korean regimes. Dr Terry says that the North Korea leader emerged from this summit with his standing enhanced. Since January, Mr Kim has met the Chinese president twice; the South Korean president; the leadership of Singapore and, finally, the US president. To a large extent, she says, ""he has normalised himself"" and difficult issues like North Korea's extraordinarily bad human rights record have been set to one side. This video can not be played Why North Koreans were last to learn of the Trump-Kim summit As well as bringing his country in from the diplomatic cold,Mr Kim received a free giveaway from President Trump, who unilaterally announced a halt to US-South Korean military exercises. Mr Trump described them not just as too costly, but as ""provocative"" - the very term that is used by Pyongyang. North Korea crisis in 300 words What are the US-South Korea war games? Reality Check: How many dead US soldiers in North Korea? The net result of all this, according to Dr Terry, is that despite Mr Trump's insistence that economic sanctions will not be relaxed soon, the political will to implement tough sanctions has been weakened. The thrust behind the ""maximum pressure"" approach has been dulled considerably. And whatever happens, it is hard to imagine President Trump going back to talk about preventive military strikes. Dr Terry believes that whatever Pyongyang may agree to it will avoid complete and verifiable nuclear disarmament. That of course does not mean that the process has no value. She notes - despite Mr Trump's assertions to the contrary - that it will take considerable time to be able to say that any deal is working. North Korea, in her view is playing for time, hoping to see out the Trump administration. Ultimately, North Korea wants to gain international acceptance of its status as a nuclear weapons state, Dr Terry believes. In her view, there should have been a clearer declaration from Pyongyang that it is committed to denuclearisation; it should have agreed to provide a full inventory of its weaponry and facilities; and it should have accepted that any deal would be fully verifiable. There should also have been, she says, a clear timeline signed up to by both parties. Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? North Korean media celebrate Trump-Kim summit Imagine a North Korean family... President Trump's decision to halt exercises with the South Korean military and to raise questions about the future of the US military presence there is another win for both Pyongyang and China. Dr Terry's fear is that Mr Trump just does not see a US troop presence in the South as that valuable. And if this is the case what of the US presence in Japan? Kori Schake, another former senior US official who is now the deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that this tendency to devalue overseas US troop deployments has been a consistent theme of the president, even on the campaign trail. This video can not be played Trump Kim summit: What happens now? Dr Schake stresses that in terms of the US debate, he is an outlier. She says the prevailing view in Washington remains that the US is better able to shape the international system in its own interests by having a set of relations with countries that share its values. Indeed, US bases and security guarantees can enable host governments to make ""braver"" decisions and she points to South Korea's record of political reform, she argues. South Korea's president pushed for the summit Talking of South Korea, its president, Moon Jae-in was in many ways the midwife for this summit. So how has the outcome played out there? Dr Terry says that Seoul has really been driving this process, terrified by the Trump administration's talk of ""bloody nose"" or decapitating strikes against the North. South Korea she says will be alarmed by the unilateral suspension of joint exercises on which they were clearly never consulted. But she believes that their main goal is to keep the process moving forward and in any case they are likely to continue their own dialogue with the North. For all the summit's shortcomings though, most analysts clearly accept that the atmosphere has changed. Washington and Pyongyang have moved away from the rhetoric that appeared to be leading them inexorably towards war. For all intents and purposes Pyongyang's nuclear and missile testing seems to have been halted and joint US-South Korean exercises are suspended for the time being, again removing a source of tension that could spark renewed crisis. But is North Korea really on the path to change? Is it really willing to give up its nuclear weapons? This summit actually offered no answers either way. All of the hard work is still to be done. And North Korea's intentions remain as uncertain as ever. US lays out terms for NK sanctions relief Imagine a North Korean family...

"North Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests so far and each one has taken it closer to what decades of international talks have tried to prevent - a nuclear weapon in the hands of one of the world's most unpredictable states. 9 October 2006 - a weapon for 'peace' Years of posturing - and attempts at negotiation by foreign powers - culminated in October 2006 with anannouncement by Pyongyang,externalthat it had carried out its first nuclear explosion. Like all tests that would follow, it took place underground, in tunnels dug into a remote mountainous site called Punggye-ri, in the north-east. All of the tests have been conducted underground at the Punggye-ri site in the north-east The device is assumed to have used plutonium, sourced from the North'snuclear facility at Yongbyon. International observers estimated the blast had an energy discharge of about a kilotonne, less than a tenth of the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. Many believed this indicated a nuclear ""fizzle"" rather than a fully effective blast. But the North said it hadjoined the nuclear club,external, and that its bomb would contribute to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. The second test was bigger, with an estimated yield of between two and eight kilotonnes. North Korea said it had achieved a ""higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology"". The second test, here applauded by Party officials, was seen as an attempt by the North to prove it could still conduct a test despite political uncertainty The nuclear tests are initially detected by the seismic waves they generate While the international consensus was that a nuclear test had happened, no radiation was detected. The ability to contain a nuclear test would in itself be abig advance for the North.,external It also followed hard on the heels of a rocket launch which put a satellite in space, but which was seen as a cover for a missile test. Both were seen as an attempt by ailing leader Kim Jong-il to prove the North's nuclear capacity before he died. In the early hours of 12 February 2013, unusual seismic activity was again detected around Punggye-ri. The North said it had tested ""a miniaturised and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously"". Satellite images in days before the blast had indicated a test was about to take place The reference to ""miniaturised"" stoked fears that Pyongyang was closer to producing a device small enough to fit on a long-range missile. Speculation was rife that the testinvolved a uranium device, though this hasnever been confirmed beyond doubt.,external A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North'splutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile. Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy. The first indication was again a report of an ""artificial quake"" in North Korea, registering about magnitude 5.1, close to Punggye-ri. North Korea later announced it had conducted itsfirst successful test of a hydrogen bomb. H-bombs, also known as thermonuclear warheads, are massively more powerful than atomic bombs, using fusion - the merging of atoms - rather than fission to unleash enormous amounts of energy. Though again it has never been confirmed, that claimalarmed the international community. Observations from afar suggested the blast detected was not large enough to have been a full thermonuclear device, but may have involved some nuclear fusion. Again, North Korea said the device had been miniaturised. A few months later, on 9 March, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea scientists had been able to do what had long been feared, and make a nuclear warheadsmall enough to fit on a warhead. It came after days of threats to carry out ""indiscriminate"" attacks on the US and South Korea. But analysts at the time said it was impossible to confirm. North Korea announced its fifth nuclear test in 2016 in September. Estimates of the explosive yield have varied. South Korea's military said it was about 10 kilotonnes butother expertssay initial indications suggest 20 kilotons or more. The bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of about 15 kilotonnes. South Koreans react to the latest test Nearly a year later, on 8 August 2017,information leaked to the Washington Post,externalindicated US intelligence officials believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. The new assessment comes only weeks after North Korea tested what intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), it says were capable ofreaching the US mainland. North Korea claimed it has successfully tested what the world has worried about - a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile. Hours before state media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb Seismic readings of 6.3 indicated the test was bigger than any other that has been conducted. Some early estimates said that the test came in at about 100-150 kilotonnes, potentially 10 times larger than last time. North Korean state media called it a ""perfect success"" and a ""very meaningful step in completing the national nuclear weapons programme"".

"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces The UK's opposition to the death penalty has not changed, the security minister has said - after a government letter about two IS suspects emerged. Ben Wallace said the message from Home Secretary Sajid Javid to the US attorney general - that the UK would not ""require assurances"" over the death penalty - was a ""rare decision"". But Labour said the UK was abandoning a ""principled opposition"". The IS suspects were captured in Syria and could be sent to the US for trial. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheik, from London, are accused of being the last two members ofan IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"", which killed Western hostages. After the pair were caught in January by US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters they complained they would not get a fair trial becausethe UK government had stripped them of their British citizenship. Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Families of IS victims say 'Beatles' pair 'should face trial' Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? The UK could provide intelligence as part of the men's prosecution in the US. For years, Britain sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. But, in a letterleaked to the Telegraph,external, Mr Javid said he would seek no assurances about Kotey and Elsheik's sentences. Asking an urgent question in the Commons, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it was not possible to be a ""little bit in favour"" of the death penalty. Describing the UK stance as ""abhorrent and shameful"", she called on ministers ""even at this late stage to reverse this decision"". This video can not be played Wallace and Abbott clash over death penalty and IS case But Mr Wallace maintained ministers had complied with the European Convention on Human Rights and international law in relation to the cases. He said: ""The crimes that we are talking about involve the beheading and videoing of those beheadings of dozens of innocent people by one of the most abhorrent organisations walking this Earth. ""And simply to say if we were unable to prosecute them in this country, that we should simply let them free to roam around the United Kingdom... is simply bizarre and not justice to the victims."" Mr Wallace was challenged by MPs from all parties to explain the decision. Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said it represented a ""major departure from normal policy"" and the ""issue is going to continue to haunt the government"". Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the home secretary had ""unilaterally ripped up"" the UK's principles, adding: ""What the minister [Mr Wallace] has said today is a contradiction of the longstanding abolition of the death penalty strategy."" By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Why might Mr Javid take this decision, in apparent breach of long-standing British policy? Perhaps the real motivation is the government's desperation to avoid having to try these two men in Britain. Cases like these are extremely difficult to prosecute because of the difficulty in obtaining evidence, finding witnesses, and establishing what crimes have been committed in which jurisdiction. And in his letter, Mr Javid argues that a more successful prosecution is more likely in the US where laws are different to the UK. What ministers and MPs believe is that Mr Javid is attempting to smooth the way for the Americans to take the cases by letting them know that the UK will not, for once, kick up a fuss about the death penalty. In other words, this is all part of a deal. Read more from James Normally, Britain seeks assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used when the UK provided information or extradited suspects. Number 10 said it was ""a long-standing position of the government to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle"". But it added that - in the case of ""the Beatles"" - it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"". The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official says this was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used - although they did not go into details. But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where some suspects have been detained for years without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence. Amnesty International said the UK was ""leaving the door wide open to charges of hypocrisy and double standards"". Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheik were members of an IS cell known as the Beatles, because of their British accents. The group - which  included two others from west London, Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis - were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria. US officials believe they beheaded more than 27 Western hostages and tortured many more. Each was known to their hostages by their respective Beatles moniker - Paul, Ringo, John and George. Left to right: Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded,was killed by a drone strike in 2015. Davis was convicted of being a senior IS member andwas jailed in Turkey last year. UK-born Kotey is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background, while Sudan-born Elsheikh came to London as a child and later became a British citizen.

The level 3 or amber alert,externalis in place until 09:00 BST Friday for much of the east and south-east of England. The hottest day of the year has been recorded at Santon Downham in Suffolk, which reached33.3 C on Monday (92F),external. The National Farmers' Union has warned of crops ""parched to the bone"" and livestock farmers using winter rations. The level 3 warning is issued when temperatures are predicted to hit 30C during the day, and 15C at night, for at least two consecutive days. In the affected areas there is a 90% probability of heatwave conditions, the Met Office said.

The public were urged to take the usual precautions in the sun, including covering up, wearing sun screen, keeping your house cool and drinking plenty of water. By David Shukman, BBC science editor Heatwaves are nothing new for the UK. I was struggling through my A-level exams during the blazing weather of 1976 when for 15 days running temperatures were above 32C somewhere in the UK. This year has not matched that. So far, at least. But since those overheated schooldays the planet has changed. The average temperature has risen. And scientists are convinced that we are starting to feel the effects of humanity's greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. They point to the multiple heatwaves under way in different parts of the globe at the same time. While parts of the UK are sweltering, there's stunning warmth in Scandinavia even inside the usually chilly Arctic Circle and in Japan dozens of peoplehave reportedly died from record temperatures. The latest research into the future of the climate does not say that we will get heatwaves every year. The next few summers may well be cool. But studies do suggest that heatwaves will become more frequent, and that when they happen they will last longer than they do now. So children currently enjoying the holiday sunshine may well grow up into a world where heatwaves seem almost normal. The warning follows weeks of dry, hot weather, which has already causeda hosepipe ban,closed canalsand revealedancient hidden landscapes. In 1976, there were 15 days running where somewhere in the UKwas over 32C,external. That record has not been matched by the 2018 heatwave yet In 1969, there were 70 days in one part of Suffolk with less than a millimetre of rain in total. Two places in west London have so far gone 54 days with the same low rainfall The Met Office said the first half of summer has been the driest since 1961. Several parts of the country have had 54 consecutive dry days, meaning less than 1mm of rain fell. The longest run with no rain at all has been 48 days at Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds. The Met Office said most of its weather stations in East Anglia have had no rain at all since 21 June.

""Spring crops that farmers sowed in April barely knowing what rain is,"" he told the BBC. ""As you travel west... a little bit more rain but even here the grass has stopped growing and that's a problem for livestock farmers because they need to have that grass growth to sustain their sheep and cows through to the winter. ""We're hearing that livestock farmers are now having to feed winter rations to their stock and that's going to cause problems later on."" Mr Smith said vegetable farmers also face problems as their reservoirs - used for irrigation - begin to run dry. ""If this weather continues... we will see impacts on vegetable production. The signs are ominous."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Clockwise from top left: Michael Hayden, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, John Brennan, James Clapper, and Susan Rice. President Donald Trump is said to be considering revoking security clearance for ex-CIA boss John Brennan and other Obama-era critics of him. The White House named six former intelligence, law enforcement and national security chiefs. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said they had ""politicised and in some cases monetised their public service"" to make ""baseless accusations"" about Mr Trump. But at least two of them no longer have security clearance. In Monday's scheduled news conference, Mrs Sanders also cited: James Comey, former FBI director Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence Susan Rice, former National Security Adviser Michael Hayden, former National Security Agency director This video can not be played Ex-US director of National Intelligence James Clapper: ""Watergate pales really in my view compared to what we're confronting now"" She denied a reporter's suggestion that the president wanted to punish the former officials - most of whom have served under both Democratic and Republican presidents - for exercising their right to free speech. The press secretary said Mr Trump ""doesn't like the fact that people are politicising agencies and departments that are specifically meant to not be political and to be monetised off security clearances"". She said security clearance ""provides inappropriate legitimacy to accusations with zero evidence"". Mr Clapper told CNN the plan was ""a very, very petty thing to do"". He said it would be ""a terrible precedent and a very sad commentary. And it's an abuse of the system."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump's brawl with members of the intelligence community continues apace. The threat to revoke security clearances of a handful of former government officials who have been outspoken critics of the president is only the latest jab. Never mind that some of those named insist they have no access to revoke. And never mind that even if the White House goes through with its threat, it will do little to silence their various condemnations of the president. Former top intelligence officers like Michael Hayden and John Brennan are sought-after as public speakers and television talking heads because of their experience and expertise, not their current access levels. Instead, the move gives the White House a chance to stoke the us-against-them drama that Mr Trump's supporters love and cast doubt on the authority and morality of highly visible Trump detractors. It also offers the media a new topic to chew on, instead of the latest twists in the Russia story or recorded conversations about former Playboy models. Of course, any action could someday be cited by a Democratic president to revoke Trump-era security clearances - as yet another government tradition is consumed in partisan flames. Mrs Sanders said that ""accusing the president of the United States of treasonous activity... when you have the nation's deepest, most sacred secrets at your hands"" was something that made Mr Trump ""very concerned"". Mr Hayden said on Twitter after the announcement that even if the president decided to take away his clearance, it would not change anything he says or writes. Allow Twitter content?

A friend of Mr Comey tweeted that the fired FBI chief no longer possesses a security clearance.

"A record number of primary school children are leaving school severely obese, according to new figures from Public Health England. Data for 2016/17 shows one in 25 10 to 11 year olds were severely obese. That's more than 22,000 children, and the highest level since records began. Levels of childhood obesity have remained fairly stable in recent years, but the new analysis shows that severe obesity has been on an upward trend over the last decade. The data from the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) for children for the year 2016/17 has detailed the trends in severe obesity for the first time. The programme found: More deprived areas have a much higher rate of overweight and obese children, compared to the most well-off areas. This disparity is happening at a faster rate in school leavers in year 6, than in reception age. The figures did however show a downward trend of reception age boys being overweight and obese. When records began in 2006/07, one in 32 primary school leavers were severely obese. Severe obesityis BMI on or above the 99.6th percentile for a child's age and sex. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said the trends were ""extremely worrying and have been decades in the making - reversing them will not happen overnight."" She said ""bold measures are needed to tackle this threat to our children's health"". The Department of Health recently announced thesecond phase of its childhood obesity planto help halve childhood obesity by 2030. As part of that, sweets and high-fat snacks will be banned from supermarket checkouts, and there will be tighter restrictions on junk food ads on TV. Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the government's obesity plans need to be ""fully and swiftly implemented"". ""It's very concerning that the number of children with a weight that is classified as severely obese is now at an all-time high. Children with obesity are five times more likely to have obesity as adults, putting them at risk of diseases including Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart and liver disease, as well as associated mental health conditions."" Dr Max Davie, Officer for Health Promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said although the new data was ""shocking"" it was ""not surprising"". ""The Government's childhood obesity plan is encouraging but if the policies within it are not quickly enacted, more children are going to face a life that's limited in quality and expectancy"" he said. ""Obesity is entirely preventable, so this new data should be the springboard the government needs in order to put these policies in place and begin turning around lives.""

"Shagufta Khan was the director of Best Meet and Greet Ltd A woman has admitted misleading Gatwick holidaymakers who paid for their cars to be stored securely, when instead they were left in fields and public car parks. Shagufta Khan, 42, was the director of Best Meet and Greet Ltd, which West Sussex County Council's Trading Standards team investigated after complaints. At Hove Crown Court Mrs Khan admitted engaging in unfair and misleading commercial practice. She will be sentenced on Friday. Cars were kept in fields, not in a secure place as advertised The court heard the company's website contained cheap short-term offers which pushed customers to book quickly, and it had false testimonies from ""satisfied"" customers. Mrs Khan, of Stace Way, Crawley, also ""misled customers on the characteristics of their car parking"", by claiming vehicles would be securely guarded at all times, when actually they were stored in public car parks and muddy fields. The court heard it was ""not likely"" Mrs Khan was the person with ultimate control over the company, and there was a strong chance other people were involved. Cars were brought back filthy after being kept with Best Meet and Greet Ltd Best Meet and Greet is one of various firms which has been investigated by Trading Standards for similar reasons, includingGatwick First ParkingandLondon Parking Gatwick. Karen Aldous used the service, and when she returned from her holiday Best Meet and Greet were unable to find the vehicle. After four-and-a-half hours it was returned, but it was dented and covered in mud. She said: ""The repairs have been estimated at around Â£700, and I think Best Meet and Greet should cover the cost of those repairs."" The company website claimed the facility was manned and guarded 24/7 After the conviction Richard Sargeant, Trading Standards team manager, said: ""We think this is very serious; customers are being defrauded. ""This company was making statements on their website and they were false. Consumers paid good money for their cars to be securely parked, but they weren't - they were parked unprofessionally in a field."" A Gatwick spokesperson said: ""Gatwick Airport strongly recommends passengers use official on-airport parking, or companies registered with Gatwick's approved off-airport parking operators scheme. ""While we sympathise with all affected passengers, it is important to stress that Gatwick has no relationship with the parking operator involved in this trial.""

"I Admit sees the singer confess to relationship ""mistakes"" but fiercely deny illegal sexual acts. R Kelly has responded to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him by releasing a 19-minute song I Admit. The track, posted on the R&B star's SoundCloud page on Monday, admits to infidelity butdenies allegations of paedophilia and non-consensual sex. The response follows aBBC Three investigationthat sparked the #MuteRKelly campaign to limit his business dealings and air-play. Kelly denies all the allegations. I Admit sees the singer confess to relationship ""mistakes"" but fiercely deny illegal sexual acts. ""How they gon' say I don't respect these women, when all I've done is represent? ""Take my career and turn it upside down, 'cause you mad I've got some girlfriends."" He then sings that he thinks it's ""crazy"" to call his behaviour...""paedophile"". The 51-year-old says he has been unfaithful, singing: ""I admit I'm sorry for my sins."" He also alludes to alcohol abuse and struggles with fame. Kelly has been dogged for years by allegations of sexual abuse, with claims of underage sex, and allegations that he trapped several women in a ""sex cult"" - all of which he denies. These claims resurfaced in a BBC Three documentary which featured numerous fresh allegations from Kelly's former girlfriends. One partner, 19-year-old Faith Rodgers, subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging the singer ""knowingly"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease, while subjecting her to mental, physical and verbal abuse. R Kelly has seen his reputation tarnished in recent months A representative for the singer""categorically"" denied all the claims and allegationsat the time. And I Admit sees Kelly offer a second rebuttal. ""Said I'm abusing these women... that's... absurd. ""They're brainwashed, really? Kidnapped, really? Can't eat, really? Real talk, that... sound silly."" One of the women at the centre of the ""sex cult"" allegations is Jocelyn Savage. Shetold the TMZ website last year,externalthat she was not in a cult and was not being brainwashed, but was ""in a happy place in my life"". After the song came out, the lawyer representing the 23-year-old's parentstold the Hip Hop Enquirer,external: ""This is R Kelly's attempt to shift the narrative and make himself out to be the victim. Gerald Griggs continued: ""Stop making admissions in the form of songs that could be detrimental to his position in this case. ""If he wants ourâ¦ case to end, reunite the daughter with her family, stop making music, stop tweeting, stop instagramming. Put her on a plane. Or make her available in person. It's very simple."" The history of allegations against R Kelly Later in his new song, Kelly addresses his accusers directly - taking explicit aim at the #MuteRKelly movementfor a second time. The campaign discourages people from listening to Kelly's music as a result of the allegations against him and has asked his record label, concert promoters, ticket sellers and streaming services to withdraw their support. Spotify and Apple Musicremoved the singer from their playlists in response. ""You may have your opinions, entitled to your opinions/But really am I supposed to go to jail or lose my career because of your opinion?"" the song continues. This video can not be played Why people are calling to #MuteRKelly... again ""Yeah, go ahead and stone me, point your finger at me. Turn the world against me, but only god can mute me,"" he says. The track also sees Kelly reflect, and acknowledge that, as a child, he was himself a victim of sexual abuse. He also sings: ""I never thought it would come to this, to be the most disrespected artist. ""So I had to write a song about this, 'cause they always take my words and twist it.""

"Armed police were guarding the scene outside the hotel Six people have been arrested after a woman had her neck slashed in a hotel. Police said the victim managed to flag down officers outside Beetham Tower on Deansgate, Manchester, at about 11:10 BST. Four men, a woman and a teenage girl have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The victim was taken to hospital with lacerations to her neck but later discharged, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. Cordons are in place outside the Hilton, where three marked police cars remain. Det Insp Patrick Goodrich said: ""Thankfully the woman's injuries were less serious than first thought, but we could easily have been dealing with her death - the thought is terrifying."" GMP also said the attack is not believed to be related to terrorism or thought to be a random act. Armed officers are no longer at the scene. The hotel is located in the Beetham Tower The four arrested men are aged 20, 24, 26 and 26, the woman is 20 and the teenage girl is 17. They are all in custody for questioning and inquiries are ongoing, police said. A section of pavement opposite the hotel outside the 340 Deansgate office building has also been blocked off.

"Ian Stanton has defended his decision to allow his son to hang his head over the railway platform edge The father of a boy photographed with his head over the edge of a railway station platform says his son was never in danger. Ian Stanton, 46, saida picture posted online which has since gone viraldid not portray the incident in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, accurately. Tim Brown, who took the photo, described it as ""absolutely unbelievable"". Mr Stanton is due to talk to British Transport Police. He said he did not agree with the many hundreds of comments on social media criticising his decision to let his six-year-old son Devon peer at the track from the platform edge on Saturday. 'Inquisitive kid' ""We were on our way to the Bath Carnival and our train was delayed,"" he said. ""Devon is an inquisitive kid and wanted to pick up a stone or piece of wood from the track as treasure. ""I told him it wasn't a good idea and then he asked if he could have a quick look."" This video can not be played Trowbridge platform edge child not in danger, says dad Mr Stanton said he was ""standing right by"" his son and ""could see the direction the trains were coming from and the information board"". He said: ""I knew the man who took the photo wasn't happy but it is just a snapshot - Devon was there for all of 30 seconds - and all the people who have commented weren't there. ""Anybody who knows me and knows my kids would realise he wasn't in danger."" Mr Stanton added that high speed trains which pass through the station are always announced via the station intercom.

"A graphic novel has made it onto the Man Booker longlist for the first time. Sabrina by Nick Drnaso tells the story of a girl who goes missing, leaving behind a videotape with clues about her disappearance. Chicago-born Drnaso, who is 29, won an LA Times book prize with his first collection Beverly. ""Given the changing shape of fiction, it was only a matter of time before a graphic novel was included,"" the judges said. This year's Man Booker Prize longlist consists of six writers from the UK, three from the US, two from Ireland and two from Canada. The eligibility rules were changed in 2013 to allow international authors to be nominated, as long as their book was written in English and published in the UK. The longlist for the Â£50,000 prize will be whittled down to six in September before the final winner is announced on Tuesday 16 October.

"This video can not be played 'It just seemed very surreal' Canadian officials have identified the suspect in Sunday's deadly shooting in Toronto as Faisal Hussain, 29. The Ontario Special Investigations Unit (SIU) said it was releasing his name due ""to the exceptional circumstances of this tragic incident"". A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city. Thirteen others were injured in the rampage in Canada's largest city. The SIU, which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, said a post-mortem examination on the suspected shooter is scheduled for Tuesday. According to the SIU, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street during the shooting, which happened on Sunday evening shortly after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday). ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. In a statement released to various media outlets, Hussain's family expressed their ""deepest condolences"" to the victims and their families for what they called ""our son's horrific actions"". â They said their son suffered from serious mental health challenges and had struggled with untreatable psychosis and depression most of his life. ""Our hearts are in pieces for the victims and for our city as we all come to grips with this terrible tragedy,"" they said. The first victim to be identified was Reese Fallon, 18. Reese Fallon Local member of Parliament, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, confirmed that she was one of the two killed in the shooting. Mr Erskine Smith told media that the family was ""devastated"" and was asking for privacy at this time. ""She was a local young Liberal, smart, passionate and full of energy,"" the Liberal MP told the BBC in a statement. ""It is a huge loss."" Reese Fallon ""was highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends"" Ms Fallon was a recent high school graduate and, in a statement, the Toronto District School Board said they were ""heartbroken"" by the news. The school board said she ""was highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends"". According to her Facebook profile, she was about to begin studying at McMaster University. Julianna Kozis was the second victim to be named On Tuesday, police released the identity of the 10-year-old victim: Julianna Kozis of Markham. Emergency services were called out just after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday) to the Greektown district of Toronto, a busy avenue known for its restaurants and summertime patios. Witnesses described hearing volleys of shots as people tried to run from the gunfire. Police say eight women and seven men were shot, ranging in age from 10 to 59. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Bethany Haines said the men should face justice for her father's murder They were allegedly members of an Islamic State cell notorious for killing Western hostages and putting their deaths on camera. Western media dubbed them ""the Beatles"" because of their British accents. Today one is dead, killed by a US drone, a second is in prison in Turkey for terrorism, andthe last two are in the custody of US allies in war-torn Syria. The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who are holding them say they have yet to receive a request from any country to hand them over. Victims' families want Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh to face justice, but the question of where justice might best be served is complex. US journalist James Foley was beheaded by IS in 2014- a crime ""beyond imagination"", his mother Diane told BBC News. British fighters Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces She said she would like to see the captured fighters tried in the US. ""But as long as they're brought to fair trial and detained and justice is served, I would be most grateful,"" she added. Two other American hostages, journalist Steve Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig (also known as Abdul-Rahman Kassig), were killed by IS too. Islamic State 'beheads US hostage Steven Sotloff' US hostage Peter Kassig 'killed by IS' The US defence department said it was ""still considering options"" but a spokesman added: ""Our intention is to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed."" Guantanamo Bay prison remains open The US Congress has been deeply opposed to terror suspects being held on US soil. So one option could be to send the suspects to Guantanamo Bay, the US detention camp in Cuba that was set up to hold jihadists captured in the ""war on terror"". President Donald Trump said during the 2016 election campaign he wanted to ""load it up with some bad dudes"". Last month,Mr Trump signed an order keeping the camp open. Human rights groups argue the very existence of Guantanamo and internment without trial play into the hands of jihadist recruiters, who portray it as an example of US injustice. British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines, who had gone to Syria for humanitarian reasons, were both killed by IS. Mr Haines's daughter Bethany told BBC Scotland she hoped his killers died a ""slow, painful death"" and said she would want to look Kotey and Elsheikh in the eye if they stood trial. French journalist Nicolas Henin was held hostage by IS for 10 months and believes ""the Beatles"" were among those holding him. He told BBC News he wanted Kotey and Elsheikh returned to the UK to face justice. ""I would like to see them brought back to Britain, just like I would like to see all other European jihadis brought back to their home countries, to be judged fairly in their home country,"" he said. ""Because the worst thing we can do with a terrorist is to deprive him from his right because then you make the terrorist a victim."" However, the BBC understands Kotey and Elsheikh, who grew up in west London, have both been stripped of their British citizenship. IS Beatles 'should die slow, painful death' Briton Alan Henning 'killed by IS' A British defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has called for Kotey and Elsheikh to be tried in an international criminal court. It is important that ""terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held to account for their actions"", he said. The International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, can prosecute suspects for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. However, barring a UN Security Council request, it will prosecute cases only when states are unwilling or unable to do so, and is not intended to replace national criminal systems. It has been accused of focusing too much on war crimes in Africa, such as in Darfur and Democratic Republic of Congo. Judges consider Afghan war crimes inquiry What is the International Criminal Court? The prospect of an international criminal tribunal being set up for Syria, modelled on those for the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda, seems remote. The conflict drags on and deep divisions, most notably between the US and Russia, continue to beset  the UN Security Council. Another country with a potential claim on prosecuting Kotey and Elsheikh is Japan. IS beheaded two of its citizens, Haruna Yukawa and journalist Kenji Goto. Japan PM outrage at 'hostage Haruna Yukawa death' Japan outrage at hostage Kenji Goto 'beheading' The captured IS fighters could just remain in Syria, of course. However, the situation there is fluid as the SDF battles IS remnants, forces loyal to the Syrian government and, increasingly, Turkey. US forces repel attack on Syrian allies Turkey 'will take fight as far as Iraq' This video can not be played The group known as ""The Beatles"" beheaded IS hostages Last year, Turkey jailed the third living member of ""the Beatles"", Aine Davis, for seven-and-a-half years for membership of a terrorist organisation. Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa, who was subjected to mock executions, told BBC News at the time it did not matter where Davis was tried. ""He should face justice wherever it is,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter if it's in England or Turkey or wherever. He should be in jail forever."" The fourth and most infamous ""Beatle"",Mohammed Emwazi, who appeared in beheading videos, was killed by a drone strike on his carin the IS stronghold of Raqqa in 2016.

"I Admit sees the singer confess to relationship ""mistakes"" but fiercely deny illegal sexual acts. R Kelly has responded to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him by releasing a 19-minute song I Admit. The track, posted on the R&B star's SoundCloud page on Monday, admits to infidelity butdenies allegations of paedophilia and non-consensual sex. The response follows aBBC Three investigationthat sparked the #MuteRKelly campaign to limit his business dealings and air-play. Kelly denies all the allegations. I Admit sees the singer confess to relationship ""mistakes"" but fiercely deny illegal sexual acts. ""How they gon' say I don't respect these women, when all I've done is represent? ""Take my career and turn it upside down, 'cause you mad I've got some girlfriends."" He then sings that he thinks it's ""crazy"" to call his behaviour...""paedophile"". The 51-year-old says he has been unfaithful, singing: ""I admit I'm sorry for my sins."" He also alludes to alcohol abuse and struggles with fame. Kelly has been dogged for years by allegations of sexual abuse, with claims of underage sex, and allegations that he trapped several women in a ""sex cult"" - all of which he denies. These claims resurfaced in a BBC Three documentary which featured numerous fresh allegations from Kelly's former girlfriends. One partner, 19-year-old Faith Rodgers, subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging the singer ""knowingly"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease, while subjecting her to mental, physical and verbal abuse. R Kelly has seen his reputation tarnished in recent months A representative for the singer""categorically"" denied all the claims and allegationsat the time. And I Admit sees Kelly offer a second rebuttal. ""Said I'm abusing these women... that's... absurd. ""They're brainwashed, really? Kidnapped, really? Can't eat, really? Real talk, that... sound silly."" One of the women at the centre of the ""sex cult"" allegations is Jocelyn Savage. Shetold the TMZ website last year,externalthat she was not in a cult and was not being brainwashed, but was ""in a happy place in my life"". After the song came out, the lawyer representing the 23-year-old's parentstold the Hip Hop Enquirer,external: ""This is R Kelly's attempt to shift the narrative and make himself out to be the victim. Gerald Griggs continued: ""Stop making admissions in the form of songs that could be detrimental to his position in this case. ""If he wants ourâ¦ case to end, reunite the daughter with her family, stop making music, stop tweeting, stop instagramming. Put her on a plane. Or make her available in person. It's very simple."" The history of allegations against R Kelly Later in his new song, Kelly addresses his accusers directly - taking explicit aim at the #MuteRKelly movementfor a second time. The campaign discourages people from listening to Kelly's music as a result of the allegations against him and has asked his record label, concert promoters, ticket sellers and streaming services to withdraw their support. Spotify and Apple Musicremoved the singer from their playlists in response. ""You may have your opinions, entitled to your opinions/But really am I supposed to go to jail or lose my career because of your opinion?"" the song continues. This video can not be played Why people are calling to #MuteRKelly... again ""Yeah, go ahead and stone me, point your finger at me. Turn the world against me, but only god can mute me,"" he says. The track also sees Kelly reflect, and acknowledge that, as a child, he was himself a victim of sexual abuse. He also sings: ""I never thought it would come to this, to be the most disrespected artist. ""So I had to write a song about this, 'cause they always take my words and twist it.""

"The prosecution said Lee Savage was a ""violent sexual predator"" A ""sexual sadist"" has been jailed for raping three women he met through the internet dating website Plenty of Fish. Lee Savage attacked females from Cumbria, South Tyneside and Dumfries and Galloway between 2015 and earlier this year. The 25-year-old, of Skiddaw View, Penrith, originally denied a total of 10 offences of rape and sexual assault but then changed his plea to guilty. He was given a life sentence and must serve a minimum of 11 years in jail. Prosecutor Tim Evans told Carlisle Crown Court earlier that Savage was a ""persuasive and manipulative man as well as a violent sexual predator"" who had carried out a ""planned and persistent rape campaign"". In a statement, one of his victims said he had ""violated my whole life"". The court heard the first rape, in January of 2015, was committed less than four months after Savage was given a community order for sending explicit images to a 13-year-old girl he had befriended on Facebook. Sentencing him for his latest crimes, Judge James Adkin told him: ""You are, in my judgement, a sexual sadist."" Savage initially claimed each of the women had consented to sex, but he changed his plea after facing ""overwhelming evidence"", Isla Chilton, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said. He must also sign the sex offenders register for life.

The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work afterwards.

Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? Prime Minister Theresa May will meet the Austrian chancellor and Czech and Estonian prime ministers this week, saying both sides know ""the clock is ticking"" on negotiations. The EU and the UK want a deal in place by October. This video can not be played Theresa May is asked how she unwinds Speaking to workers at a factory in Newcastle, Mrs May said she was working to get a deal that MPs would support when it comes before Parliament - but was also ""stepping up"" government preparations for no deal being reached. She was asked about Treasury forecasts of an economic hit to the North East of England after Brexit - in response she said the government wanted ""frictionless"" trade at borders and also promised investment in transport infrastructure and skills. And asked how she unwinds from the ""world's most stressful job"", she said she enjoyed walking, cooking and watching US crime TV series NCIS. This video can not be played Three politicians give their view on a Brexit ""no deal"" The government's plan has been set out in a White Paper which proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement of people and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise, which would leave the UK governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. The plan sparked two cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. After Parliament rises for the summer recess on Tuesday, Downing Street said the UK negotiating team would be travelling to Brussels while the foreign secretary, chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office will meet counterparts across Europe. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. He questioned whether the plans could work without causing extra bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected. New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said a deal could be done by October - but also that making ""no deal"" preparations such as hiring extra border staff was part of being a ""responsible government"". The Times has reported that the head of Amazon in the UK, Doug Gurr,warned of potential ""civil unrest"",externalin the event of ""no deal"" at a meeting with Mr Raab on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it seemed the government's priority was preparing for no deal, which would be bad for industry.

"Shagufta Khan was the director of Best Meet and Greet Ltd A woman has admitted misleading Gatwick holidaymakers who paid for their cars to be stored securely, when instead they were left in fields and public car parks. Shagufta Khan, 42, was the director of Best Meet and Greet Ltd, which West Sussex County Council's Trading Standards team investigated after complaints. At Hove Crown Court Mrs Khan admitted engaging in unfair and misleading commercial practice. She will be sentenced on Friday. Cars were kept in fields, not in a secure place as advertised The court heard the company's website contained cheap short-term offers which pushed customers to book quickly, and it had false testimonies from ""satisfied"" customers. Mrs Khan, of Stace Way, Crawley, also ""misled customers on the characteristics of their car parking"", by claiming vehicles would be securely guarded at all times, when actually they were stored in public car parks and muddy fields. The court heard it was ""not likely"" Mrs Khan was the person with ultimate control over the company, and there was a strong chance other people were involved. Cars were brought back filthy after being kept with Best Meet and Greet Ltd Best Meet and Greet is one of various firms which has been investigated by Trading Standards for similar reasons, includingGatwick First ParkingandLondon Parking Gatwick. Karen Aldous used the service, and when she returned from her holiday Best Meet and Greet were unable to find the vehicle. After four-and-a-half hours it was returned, but it was dented and covered in mud. She said: ""The repairs have been estimated at around Â£700, and I think Best Meet and Greet should cover the cost of those repairs."" The company website claimed the facility was manned and guarded 24/7 After the conviction Richard Sargeant, Trading Standards team manager, said: ""We think this is very serious; customers are being defrauded. ""This company was making statements on their website and they were false. Consumers paid good money for their cars to be securely parked, but they weren't - they were parked unprofessionally in a field."" A Gatwick spokesperson said: ""Gatwick Airport strongly recommends passengers use official on-airport parking, or companies registered with Gatwick's approved off-airport parking operators scheme. ""While we sympathise with all affected passengers, it is important to stress that Gatwick has no relationship with the parking operator involved in this trial.""

"A trial of new scanners at Heathrow Airport could mean passengers will not have to remove liquids from their hand luggage. The machines take a 3D X-ray, allowing security staff to check items without requiring them to be removed from bags, and can detect explosives. The worldwide rules began in 2006 after a terror plot was stopped by UK police. The Department for Transport said a ""small number"" of trials was set to last between six and 12 months.

"Bob Higgins denied all the charges involving 24 complainants, most of whom were Southampton and Peterborough Utd trainees A former Southampton football club youth coach has been found guilty of indecently assaulting a young trainee. Bob Higgins, 65, was found not guilty of another count of the same offence. The jury at Winchester Crown Court did not reach verdicts on 48 other counts of the same charge and was dismissed. The prosecution said it would seek a retrial. Higgins denied all the charges involving 24 complainants, most of whom were Southampton and Peterborough trainees. The allegations related to a period between 1971 and 1996 when Mr Higgins coached at Southampton and later at Peterborough United. The jury was discharged after deliberating for a total of 25 hours and 25 minutes, at the conclusion of a trial which lasted eight weeks. Higgins was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two of indecently assaulting one teenage boy in a car in the 1980s. He was found not guilty of indecently assaulting another teenage boy. Neither youngster can be named. A retrial on the remaining charges would be likely to be be held next year. Higgins showed no emotion as the jury returned its verdicts. He was granted bail on condition he surrenders his passport. The judge rejected a defence application for reporting restrictions to be imposed in advance of a retrial.

Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, she said that when she found out Labour had, despite criticism, adopted the new guidelines: ""I blew my top.

"The prosecution said Lee Savage was a ""violent sexual predator"" A ""sexual sadist"" has been jailed for raping three women he met through the internet dating website Plenty of Fish. Lee Savage attacked females from Cumbria, South Tyneside and Dumfries and Galloway between 2015 and earlier this year. The 25-year-old, of Skiddaw View, Penrith, originally denied a total of 10 offences of rape and sexual assault but then changed his plea to guilty. He was given a life sentence and must serve a minimum of 11 years in jail. Prosecutor Tim Evans told Carlisle Crown Court earlier that Savage was a ""persuasive and manipulative man as well as a violent sexual predator"" who had carried out a ""planned and persistent rape campaign"". In a statement, one of his victims said he had ""violated my whole life"". The court heard the first rape, in January of 2015, was committed less than four months after Savage was given a community order for sending explicit images to a 13-year-old girl he had befriended on Facebook. Sentencing him for his latest crimes, Judge James Adkin told him: ""You are, in my judgement, a sexual sadist."" Savage initially claimed each of the women had consented to sex, but he changed his plea after facing ""overwhelming evidence"", Isla Chilton, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said. He must also sign the sex offenders register for life.

"This video can not be played 'It just seemed very surreal' A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman have died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city, police say. Thirteen other people, ranging in age between 10 and 59, were injured in the attack in the Greektown district of Toronto, police chief Mark Saunders told reporters. The suspect, 29, had an exchange of gunfire with police officers before being found dead nearby. The motive for the shooting is unknown. Police have not identified the suspect, who was from Toronto, and it is unclear if he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. The attack happened on Sunday evening. In a video clip shared by Canadian media, a white man wearing a dark cap and dark clothing and carrying a shoulder bag can be seen stopping on a pavement and pulling out a handgun before firing shots. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent his sympathies to the victims and the city in a tweet, while Toronto Mayor John Tory condemned the ""despicable"" attack on ""people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening"".

Hours after the attack on Monday morning, a man allegedly tried to stab a member of the Ceremonial Guard on Parliament Hill, according to Ottawa police. The man was apprehended and arrested, Department of National Defence official Daniel Le Bouthillietold the Otawa Citizen,external. Emergency services were called out just after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday). The site of the attack is a piazza with a fountain that is popular with local people and was busy at the time, the Toronto Globe and Mail writes. A number of people were reportedly hurt in a cafe called the Demetres, while others were hit in the street. Det Sgt Terry Browne, who is leading the investigation into the shootings, told reporters on Monday that ""some individuals have what may be described as life-changing injuries"" following the attack. According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street, a short distance from the cafe. ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. Andrew Mantzios had been drinking coffee with friends by the fountain when he heard shots and turned around to see the gunman coming towards his group. ""He had this horrible expression on his face,"" Mr Mantzios was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail. The gunman fired at a crowd of people waiting to cross the street, he said. ""And then a lady tried to run and she fell down. He turned around and shot her point blank, two or three times."" By Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto The Danforth - usually a busy strip for commuters - was quiet and empty on Monday morning. Police tape cordoned off multiple blocks of the main commercial stretch as detectives continued their search for evidence. ""It's really terrible and unprecedented,"" says Anita Nador, who lives just blocks away from where the shooting took place.

"This video can not be played 'It just seemed very surreal' A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman have died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city, police say. Thirteen other people, ranging in age between 10 and 59, were injured in the attack in the Greektown district of Toronto, police chief Mark Saunders told reporters. The suspect, 29, had an exchange of gunfire with police officers before being found dead nearby. The motive for the shooting is unknown. Police have not identified the suspect, who was from Toronto, and it is unclear if he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. The attack happened on Sunday evening. In a video clip shared by Canadian media, a white man wearing a dark cap and dark clothing and carrying a shoulder bag can be seen stopping on a pavement and pulling out a handgun before firing shots. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent his sympathies to the victims and the city in a tweet, while Toronto Mayor John Tory condemned the ""despicable"" attack on ""people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening"".

Hours after the attack on Monday morning, a man allegedly tried to stab a member of the Ceremonial Guard on Parliament Hill, according to Ottawa police. The man was apprehended and arrested, Department of National Defence official Daniel Le Bouthillietold the Otawa Citizen,external. Emergency services were called out just after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday). The site of the attack is a piazza with a fountain that is popular with local people and was busy at the time, the Toronto Globe and Mail writes. A number of people were reportedly hurt in a cafe called the Demetres, while others were hit in the street. Det Sgt Terry Browne, who is leading the investigation into the shootings, told reporters on Monday that ""some individuals have what may be described as life-changing injuries"" following the attack. According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street, a short distance from the cafe. ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. Andrew Mantzios had been drinking coffee with friends by the fountain when he heard shots and turned around to see the gunman coming towards his group. ""He had this horrible expression on his face,"" Mr Mantzios was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail. The gunman fired at a crowd of people waiting to cross the street, he said. ""And then a lady tried to run and she fell down. He turned around and shot her point blank, two or three times.""

"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces The UK would not oppose the use of the death penalty if two alleged Islamic state members were extradited to the US, the home secretary says. In a letterleaked to the Telegraph,external, Sajid Javid said he would seek no assurances about the sentences. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, from west London, were captured in Syria in January. Labour said the UK had ""unilaterally abandoned"" its opposition to the death penalty. For years Britain sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. Number 10 said it was ""a long-standing position of the government to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle"". But it added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"". The PM was aware of the letter and discussions with the US on this issue were continuing, Number 10 said. The two men are accused of being the last two members ofan IS foursome dubbed ""The Beatles""because of their British accents. Earlier this year, in an interview with Associated Press, they complained that they would not get a fair trial becausethe UK government had stripped them of their British citizenship. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official told him that this case was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used. But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence. ""It's got a lot: the Metropolitan Police has spent four years gathering intelligence on them,"" he said. Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Families of IS victims say 'Beatles' pair 'should face trial' Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? In the letter to Jeff Sessions, dated 22 June 2018, Mr Javid wrote that the UK would not seek ""assurances"" over the death penalty in this particular case, but said it did not mark a change in UK policy. ""I am of the view that there are strong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case, so no such assurances will be sought,"" he said. But the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile, described the letter as ""extraordinary"". ""We do not extradite people to countries where there is a death penalty unless there is an assurance the death penalty will not be carried out,"" he told the BBC. ""This a unilateral change of policy without any consultation and I would be amazed if this had been approved explicitly by the prime minister."" By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Four years on from the summer when IS jihadists in Syria uploaded their gruesome beheading videos the ramifications of those actions continue. Hostages who survived captivity in the hands of IS have spoken of a gang of four western jihadists nicknamed the Beatles. None of them brought any military skills to the battlefield yet they were said to have been particularly sadistic in their treatment of western prisoners. The US and Britain believe that the remaining two members of the gang are Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheik,. After reportedly being stripped of their UK nationality by the Home Office, they have been in a legal limbo since being captured by Syrian Kurdish forces in January. Relatives of former hostages are extremely keen to see them face trial for their alleged crimes. Shami Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, said Mr Javid had ""secretly and unilaterally abandoned Britain's opposition to the death penalty"" and appeared to be encouraging ""this grave human rights abuse"". Left to right: Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the IS cell in Syria in 2014 - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was ""very against"" the death penalty for the pair. ""I think that will just make them martyrs in their twisted ideology,"" she said. ""I would like them held accountable by sending them to prison for the rest of their lives."" And Amnesty International called Mr Javid's decision a ""deeply worrying development"". Former home secretary and Labour peer Lord Blunkett warned that Mr Javid could be setting a precedent. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme: ""Once you have made an exception, then where do you go? The home secretary making individual decisions on individual cases is a very, very bad principle."" A spokeswoman for Theresa May said: ""The decision was taken by the home secretary and the former foreign secretary following the advice of lawyers and officials. The PM was made aware of the decision."" Asked several times whether the prime minister ""approved of"" the decision, the spokeswoman repeated that Mrs May ""was aware"" of it and said: ""We are continuing to engage with the US on this issue."" Kotey and Elsheikh were members of the IS cell with two others from west London - Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis. The group were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria, where they became infamous for their executions of Western hostages. Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded,was killed by a drone strike in 2015. Davis was convicted of being a senior IS member andwas jailed in Turkey last year. Kotey and Elsheikh were captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in January.

"This video can not be played A student activist filmed a woman and a man being beaten on 1 May France's interior minister has been grilled by MPs over his handling of a policing scandal in which a presidential security aide was filmed assaulting a demonstrator on 1 May. GÃ©rard Collomb said he learned of the video on 2 May and did not report it to prosecutors because it was a matter for President Emmanuel Macron's staff. Mr Macron fired the aide, Alexandre Benalla, on Friday, but MPs want to know why he did not act sooner. Mr Benalla, 26, faces several charges. He is accused of assault with an accomplice, interfering in police work, impersonating a police officer and illegally receiving surveillance footage. On Monday Mr Benalla, who was Mr Macron's top bodyguard during last year's election campaign, defended his actions, claiming that he was ""lending a hand"" to the riot officers at the scene after he was ""invited to observe"" their operations. He added that he believed his behaviour was being exploited for ""media and political ends"", his lawyers said. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla pictured together on Bastille Day this month Vincent Crase, a security agent for Mr Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party, has also been charged. Three police officers were charged and questioned on Saturdayfor allegedly passing surveillance footage to Mr Benalla to try to prove his innocence. Mr Collomb told MPs: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of Mr Benalla."" He said his staff had informed Mr Macron's administration about the incident and ""it was up to them to respond"". ""I did not pursue this matter any further."" Besides the MPs' inquiry, the police disciplinary body, IGPN, is also investigating the assault. Interior Minister Collomb (R) said he had assumed Mr Benalla was a regular policeman The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris writes: There is no private militia at the ElysÃ©e Palace. People can sense that the real culprit is Alexandre Benalla himself, who for a self-declared security officer showed himself disgracefully lacking in self-control. But it is also true that President Macron will not emerge unscathed. His silence has come across as a sort of majestic insouciance, which irritates. Read Hugh's analysis in full here. The French presidency has been accused of trying to cover up the assault and failing to act swiftly against Mr Benalla. Mr Macron is already under scrutiny over what some see as an elitist presidential style: there have been controversies overhis expensive new dinner serviceandplans for a private swimming pool. Public outrage has been stoked by additional footage that appears to show several police officers watching the Benalla incident without intervening. The video shows Mr Benalla dragging away a woman and then beating a man during May Day protests in Paris. Read related stories on this topic: Paris police hold 109 May Day rioters State sector reforms spark French strike Macron's meteoric rise - in depth Mr Macron has ordered a staff shake-up. Under growing pressure, he met several ministers on Sunday to discuss the row. An official said Mr Macron had described the incident as ""unacceptable"" and promised there would be ""no impunity"". But Mr Macron has not yet spoken publicly about it. Senior presidential official Alexis Kohler is to look into reorganising Mr Macron's private office so as to prevent a repeat of the incident, officials say. The video was posted on social media in May, but the case only became a political scandal after Le Monde newspaper revealed on 18 July that the attacker was Mr Benalla. He was hired as an aide to the president's chief of staff after last year's election. He was then given an apartment in an upmarket Paris district and a chauffeur-driven car, French media say. He also had the highest security clearance to parliament. In May, a few days after the incident, he was suspended for two weeks but nothing was reported to prosecutors. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot in Paris' Latin Quarter, whereabout 100 people had gathered during demonstrations against Mr Macron's public sector labour reforms- in particular the cutting of public sector workers and the introduction of merit-based pay. Police later said that about 1,200 masked and hooded individuals attended the 1 May demonstration by labour unions before clashes erupted with officers policing the event. Allow Twitter content?

In the original video of the assault, footage shows a man wearing a police helmet, but no uniform, joining CRS riot police as they tried to control the crowds. He grabs a woman by the neck, dragging her down the street, before both disappear off camera. Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking a male protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground.

"Tesco is planning to open a number of stores in a mystery new format. The store chain, the country's biggest food retailer, would not comment, but there are strong hints the new-look stores will be aimed at challenging discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl. A whole range of jobs are on offer at new-format stores in Wandsworth, London, Chatteris, Cambridgeshire and Immingham, Lincolnshire. Reports suggest it could be called Jack's, after Tesco founder Jack Cohen. The job adverts, which are headed ""Tesco - New Store Format"" all contain a line saying: ""The new retail format will be operated separately from the core Tesco business and as such benefits offered will be different from those offered at Tesco."" Tesco's move comes as retailers face an increasingly competitive environment. Since their entry into the UK, discount chains Aldi and Lidl have steadily increased their share of the market and now account for 14% of grocery sales. How UK shoppers fell in love with own brands Iceland tops shopper satisfaction list Tesco trials till-free stores On top of that, internet behemoth Amazon has edged slowly but steadily into food retailing. Last year, Amazon bought upmarket grocer Whole Foods. In the UK, Amazon offers food sales through its Amazon Fresh service, although currently that is still focused on Greater London and parts of the South East. Aldi is one of the discount chains to have made great inroads into the UK's grocery sector The established supermarkets have been trying to stay in the game Earlier this month,Tesco announced it was planning a buying partnership with France's Carrefour- a ""strategic alliance"" whereby the two will try to use their joint buying power to cut costs and offer lower prices to customers. This came after Tesco took over the wholesale giant, Booker. In April, Sainsbury's said that it was in advanced talks to buy Asda from US retail giant Walmart. Some analysts warned any move by Tesco to take on the discounters would need sensitive handling. Thomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""The possibility of Tesco opening a discount fascia in a bid to neutralise the growing threat posed by German discounters Aldi and Lidl looks a bold move, but orchestrating the emergence of a new brand without damaging the reputation of the main Tesco image will require pinpoint precision to succeed."" That point was echoed by Mark Dodds, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Marketing's Food, Drink and Agriculture committee. ""Getting the branding balance right will be vital if Tesco is to succeed in taking on the discount supermarkets. If the brand is too different it will have a tough job becoming established in the market,"" he said.

"Armed police were guarding the scene outside the hotel Six people have been arrested after a woman had her neck slashed in a hotel. Police said the victim managed to flag down officers outside Beetham Tower on Deansgate, Manchester, at about 11:10 BST. Four men, a woman and a teenage girl have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The victim was taken to hospital with lacerations to her neck but later discharged, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. Cordons are in place outside the Hilton, where three marked police cars remain. Det Insp Patrick Goodrich said: ""Thankfully the woman's injuries were less serious than first thought, but we could easily have been dealing with her death - the thought is terrifying.""

"The 1963 recording with The Konrads features Bowie performing under his birth name David Jones The first known studio recording of David Bowie is set for auction after being found in an old bread basket. The 1963 demo tape, rejected by Decca, features a 16-year-old Bowie - then known as David Jones - singing I Never Dreamed with first band The Konrads. The tape, expected to fetch Â£10,000, is being sold by the band's drummer David Hadfield, who uncovered it in his loft. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather described the tape as a ""significant recording, completely unique"". This video can not be played A clip of a 1963 recording, thought to be the first, of a teenage David Bowie singing He said it offers new insight into Bowie as a ""fledgling musician who would go on to super stardom."" The recording captures Bowie, later known as one of music's great experimentalists, at a time when he remained unsure of his musical direction. Bowie was The Konrads' saxophonist but it was decided that he should sing lead vocals for the tape. Hadfield said: ""David had no inclination to become a singer at this point, his heart and mind were focused on becoming a world class saxophone player. Bowie went on to become one of the most influential solo artists of all-time ""Our agent, Eric Easton, who also managed the Rolling Stones, asked us to do a demo so he could try and get us an audition at Decca. ""We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song. ""Decca initially turned us down, but when they eventually gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies."" Bowie left the band shortly after the audition, which did not get the band signed. He would eventually return as a solo artist six years later - changing his name in 1966 once The Monkees' Davy Jones achieved stardom. Signed to Mercury Records, he released Space Oddity - a stand-out on his self-titled second album - in 1969. This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie His global breakthrough came with 1972's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. Following this success, Space Oddity was reissued under RCA records in 1975 and went on to become Bowie's first UK number one. His ever-changing artistic persona would ultimately reshape attitudes to fashion, gender, music and culture. David Bowie: A career that shaped modern pop The Brixton-born star died of cancer in January 2016, two days after the release on his 69th birthday of his 25th studio album, Blackstar. Hatfield's newly released recording is part of a trove of memorabilia, including letters, bills, booking forms, photographs and promotional sketches from Bowie's early career.

"This video can not be played Iranian Americans on Trump's policies US President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have traded hostile warnings, amid rising tensions between the two countries. Mr Trump tweeted,externalIran would ""suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before"" if it threatened the US. Mr Rouhani earlier said that war with Iran would be ""the mother of all wars"". In May, the US left a deal which curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump threatens Iran: Twitter responds Iran faces up to its options Who are the winners and losers? Washington is now re-imposing the sanctions, despite objections from the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, who all signed the 2015 agreement. But there are other flashpoints too. The US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump's angry rhetoric has echoes of his Twitter barrages against North Korea's Kim Jong-un, whom he branded a ""madman"". Their verbal hostilities nonetheless evolved into diplomacy. On Monday, a senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guards suggested the US president's statements were part of a broader strategy. ""The remarks Trump makes against Iran are psychological warfare and he would be mistaken should he seek to take action against Iran,"" Gholamhossein Gheybparvar said, quoted by the Iranian Students News Agency. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he wanted to try to stop countries importing Iranian oil by November as part of continued pressure on Tehran. Addressing a group of Iranian Americans in California, he said the Iranian regime ""resembles the mafia more than a government"". Is there a Plan B? Why Trump ditched the deal The gathering was the first time a top US official had directly addressed such a large number of Iranian Americans, and is seen as part of the administration's strategy to increase pressure on Iran's leadership. Mr Trump has consistently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw the US release billions of dollars of frozen assets in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme The Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilising force in the Middle East, arguing the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there Gulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions In May, Mr Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's ""destabilising activities"" in the region enough, and could not detect or prevent any breaking of its terms. Analysts also cited the influence of White House Iran hawks including Mr Pompeo and US National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Mr Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor President Obama. This video can not be played People in the Iran-aligned suburbs of Beirut give their reaction to US withdrawal from the nuclear deal Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honouring its commitments. The IAEA has said its inspectors were granted access to all locations they needed to visit in 2017, but that they did not seek to enter any military sites, which Iranian officials declared off-limits - a move the US said raised doubts over Tehran's compliance. What is the nuclear accord? Pain for some of Europe's biggest companies Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? In May, Mr Pompeo outlined 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" between the US and Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.

"Tesco is planning to open a number of stores in a mystery new format. The store chain, the country's biggest food retailer, would not comment, but there are strong hints the new-look stores will be aimed at challenging discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl. A whole range of jobs are on offer at new-format stores in Wandsworth, London, Chatteris, Cambridgeshire and Immingham, Lincolnshire. Reports suggest it could be called Jack's, after Tesco founder Jack Cohen. The job adverts, which are headed ""Tesco - New Store Format"" all contain a line saying: ""The new retail format will be operated separately from the core Tesco business and as such benefits offered will be different from those offered at Tesco."" Tesco's move comes as retailers face an increasingly competitive environment. Since their entry into the UK, discount chains Aldi and Lidl have steadily increased their share of the market and now account for 14% of grocery sales. How UK shoppers fell in love with own brands Iceland tops shopper satisfaction list Tesco trials till-free stores On top of that, internet behemoth Amazon has edged slowly but steadily into food retailing. Last year, Amazon bought upmarket grocer Whole Foods. In the UK, Amazon offers food sales through its Amazon Fresh service, although currently that is still focused on Greater London and parts of the South East. Aldi is one of the discount chains to have made great inroads into the UK's grocery sector The established supermarkets have been trying to stay in the game Earlier this month,Tesco announced it was planning a buying partnership with France's Carrefour- a ""strategic alliance"" whereby the two will try to use their joint buying power to cut costs and offer lower prices to customers. This came after Tesco took over the wholesale giant, Booker. In April, Sainsbury's said that it was in advanced talks to buy Asda from US retail giant Walmart. Some analysts warned any move by Tesco to take on the discounters would need sensitive handling. Thomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""The possibility of Tesco opening a discount fascia in a bid to neutralise the growing threat posed by German discounters Aldi and Lidl looks a bold move, but orchestrating the emergence of a new brand without damaging the reputation of the main Tesco image will require pinpoint precision to succeed."" That point was echoed by Mark Dodds, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Marketing's Food, Drink and Agriculture committee. ""Getting the branding balance right will be vital if Tesco is to succeed in taking on the discount supermarkets. If the brand is too different it will have a tough job becoming established in the market,"" he said. ""On the other hand a brand too close to its core runs the risk of cannibalisation of current sales.""

"Children cool themselves using water jets at a park in Tokyo Temperatures in Japan have hit a record high, with officials issuing a fresh warning to stay safe. Japan has for days been in the grip of a deadly heatwave, although the numbers reported killed vary widely from 15 to as high as 40. On Monday, the thermometer peaked at 41.1C (106F) in Kumagaya, near Tokyo, breaking the previous national record of 41C from 2013. More than a dozen cities have seen temperatures of about 40C. Japan's disaster management agency urged people to stay in air-conditioned spaces, drink water and rest to prevent heat exhaustion. ""People in areas where temperatures are as high as 35 degrees or higher should be extremely careful"" to avoid heatstroke, a meteorological agency official told news agency AFP. ""And even at lower temperatures, the heat can be dangerous for small children and elderly people, and depending on the environment and activities you are doing,"" the official warned.

In Yokohama, a city south of Tokyo, people took part in an event known as uchimizu, or ""water ceremony"" - pouring or sprinkling cold water on to the hot pavements in an attempt to cool them. People fill wooden buckets with water before pouring it over pavements in an attempt to cool the streets Already this summer, more than 10,000 people have been taken to hospital as a result of the heat, according to the country's Kyodo news agency. On Monday, a number of senior citizens died as a result of the intense heat in prefectures surrounding Tokyo, according to the local authorities. A day earlier, the Tokyo Fire Department dispatched ambulances some 3,125 times within the capital, the largest figure for a day since it began emergency services in 1936, as heatstroke and exhaustion contributed to emergency calls, AFP reports. Tokyo's governor, Yuriko Koike, said the recent heatwave was ""exactly like living in a sauna"". More than a dozen cities have seen temperatures of about 40C The previous high was the 41C recorded in the western prefecture of Kochi in August 2013, the Japan Meteorological Agency says. The current heatwave being the hottest on record has raised some concerns about the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Olympic officials and Tokyo's local government have been discussing measures from solar-blocking paint on roads to mobile misting stations to tackle the heat. Ms Koike said the concerns were not just for the athletes participating in the games, but for spectators ""who are cheering on the road"". ""Countermeasures against heat is one of the major pillars for the success of the 2020 Olympics,"" she told reporters at a press conference on Monday.

The public were urged to take the usual precautions in the sun, including covering up, wearing sun screen, keeping your house cool and drinking plenty of water. By David Shukman, BBC science editor Heatwaves are nothing new for the UK. I was struggling through my A-level exams during the blazing weather of 1976 when for 15 days running temperatures were above 32C somewhere in the UK. This year has not matched that. So far, at least. But since those overheated schooldays the planet has changed. The average temperature has risen. And scientists are convinced that we are starting to feel the effects of humanity's greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. They point to the multiple heatwaves under way in different parts of the globe at the same time. While parts of the UK are sweltering, there's stunning warmth in Scandinavia even inside the usually chilly Arctic Circle and in Japan dozens of peoplehave reportedly died from record temperatures. The latest research into the future of the climate does not say that we will get heatwaves every year. The next few summers may well be cool. But studies do suggest that heatwaves will become more frequent, and that when they happen they will last longer than they do now. So children currently enjoying the holiday sunshine may well grow up into a world where heatwaves seem almost normal. The warning follows weeks of dry, hot weather, which has already causeda hosepipe ban,closed canalsand revealedancient hidden landscapes. In 1976, there were 15 days running where somewhere in the UKwas over 32C,external. That record has not been matched by the 2018 heatwave yet In 1969, there were 70 days in one part of Suffolk with less than a millimetre of rain in total. Two places in west London have so far gone 54 days with the same low rainfall The Met Office said the first half of summer has been the driest since 1961. Several parts of the country have had 54 consecutive dry days, meaning less than 1mm of rain fell. The longest run with no rain at all has been 48 days at Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds. The Met Office said most of its weather stations in East Anglia have had no rain at all since 21 June.

""Spring crops that farmers sowed in April barely knowing what rain is,"" he told the BBC. ""As you travel west... a little bit more rain but even here the grass has stopped growing and that's a problem for livestock farmers because they need to have that grass growth to sustain their sheep and cows through to the winter. ""We're hearing that livestock farmers are now having to feed winter rations to their stock and that's going to cause problems later on."" Mr Smith said vegetable farmers also face problems as their reservoirs - used for irrigation - begin to run dry. ""If this weather continues... we will see impacts on vegetable production.

"Children cool themselves using water jets at a park in Tokyo Temperatures in Japan have hit a record high, with officials issuing a fresh warning to stay safe. Japan has for days been in the grip of a deadly heatwave, although the numbers reported killed vary widely from 15 to as high as 40. On Monday, the thermometer peaked at 41.1C (106F) in Kumagaya, near Tokyo, breaking the previous national record of 41C from 2013. More than a dozen cities have seen temperatures of about 40C. Japan's disaster management agency urged people to stay in air-conditioned spaces, drink water and rest to prevent heat exhaustion. ""People in areas where temperatures are as high as 35 degrees or higher should be extremely careful"" to avoid heatstroke, a meteorological agency official told news agency AFP. ""And even at lower temperatures, the heat can be dangerous for small children and elderly people, and depending on the environment and activities you are doing,"" the official warned.

In Yokohama, a city south of Tokyo, people took part in an event known as uchimizu, or ""water ceremony"" - pouring or sprinkling cold water on to the hot pavements in an attempt to cool them. People fill wooden buckets with water before pouring it over pavements in an attempt to cool the streets Already this summer, more than 10,000 people have been taken to hospital as a result of the heat, according to the country's Kyodo news agency. On Monday, a number of senior citizens died as a result of the intense heat in prefectures surrounding Tokyo, according to the local authorities. A day earlier, the Tokyo Fire Department dispatched ambulances some 3,125 times within the capital, the largest figure for a day since it began emergency services in 1936, as heatstroke and exhaustion contributed to emergency calls, AFP reports. Tokyo's governor, Yuriko Koike, said the recent heatwave was ""exactly like living in a sauna"". More than a dozen cities have seen temperatures of about 40C The previous high was the 41C recorded in the western prefecture of Kochi in August 2013, the Japan Meteorological Agency says. The current heatwave being the hottest on record has raised some concerns about the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Olympic officials and Tokyo's local government have been discussing measures from solar-blocking paint on roads to mobile misting stations to tackle the heat. Ms Koike said the concerns were not just for the athletes participating in the games, but for spectators ""who are cheering on the road"". ""Countermeasures against heat is one of the major pillars for the success of the 2020 Olympics,"" she told reporters at a press conference on Monday.

"Colin Brazier's wife of 20 years, Jo, died from breast cancer Sky News presenter Colin Brazier has asked people not to wear bright colours at his wife's funeral, telling mourners to ""leave their Hawaiian shirts at home"" and wear black. Writing a piece inthe Spectator,,externalhe said he was ""ill at ease"" with some of the modern conventions surrounding funerals. The father of six said making a funeral a colourful celebration was ""unfair on children"". His wife, Jo, died earlier this month. The rise of the happy funeral More choose budget funerals, says Dignity Basic burial costs rise 77% in eight years In his article, published on Saturday, Mr Brazier said he does not plan to deliver a eulogy at his wife's funeral and has ""politely asked"" friends and former colleagues to wear ""black please, if you don't mind"". He wrote: ""It's unfair on children to insist that a funeral should mean rejoicing in a life now passed. ""Maybe grown-ups can handle the cognitive dissonance required in 'celebrating' a life rather than, you know, being all morbid. But I seriously doubt children can."" He added that wearing black gives people a ""licence"" to get upset, and to ""treat a funeral like Ascot's Ladies Day"" not only trivialises death but moves the spotlight of consolation away from the family. He said there is ""nothing funky about turning death into a fashion parade and a free-for-all of self-realisation"", adding it can ""inhibit the necessary catharsis of the grieving process"". ""The old stuff - the black and the solemn - works because it distils the wisdom of ages,"" said Mr Brazier, who is a practising Catholic. Jo Brazier, Mr Brazier's wife of 20 years, died from breast cancer aged 55 on 6 July. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He had previously asked for prayers for her on Twitter and also thanked a group of singers who had visited her hospice. Her funeral is to be held next month. People sent their condolences to the Sky News journalist on social media, with many thanking him for his ""moving"" article and offering ""another perspective"". According toa YouGov poll published in 2016,,externalwearing black is now only seen as a requirement at funerals by 22% of people. Among those polled, 45% think wearing other colours are fine as long as they are dark and sombre, while 29% believe any colour is appropriate to wear for a funeral. Anda survey of 2,000 people by ICM in 2015suggest 54% wanted their funeral to be a ""celebration of life"". Professor Douglas Davies, director of Durham University's Centre for Death and Life Studies, said it is not known whether wearing black rather than colourful clothing can help the grieving process. But he said having a ""cultural agreement"" on the emotion at an event would be expected to help mourners. ""There would be a sense of togetherness, the togetherness in the shared grief symbolised in the uniformity of dressing,"" he said. Professor Davies, one of the leading experts in the history, theology and sociology of death, said the trend towards less-traditional funeral dress has emerged in the last 15 years. He said it has developed alongside the motif of a funeral as a ""celebration of life"", which he suggests is associated with the drop in people believing in life after death. Funerals are now less a discussion of heaven and more of a retrospective look at the person's identity, he explained. The tradition of wearing black to mourn became familiar by the mid-19th century. When Queen Victoria wore black for the rest of her life after the death of Prince Albert, she ""set the royal seal on black"", said Professor Davies. Nowadays, according toDebrett's,external, black is still the usual colour of mourning, but dark colours like grey or navy blue are acceptable. Debretts also suggests that dressing modestly and smartly is more important than unbroken black.

"Full-fibre broadband should be fitted as standard in all new homes, the government has said. The proposal comes as part of anew national telecoms strategy,externaldrawn up by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Under its targets, all of the UK will have full-fibre broadband coverage by 2033, replacing the copper wire network that currently delivers the service. It proposes legislation to encourage more private infrastructure investment. Earlier this month, research was published indicating thatthe UK has slipped from 31st to 35th placein the global broadband league tables, behind 25 other European countries. The data was collected by M-Lab, a partnership between Google Open Source Research and Princeton University's PlantLab, and theresults compiled,externalby UK broadband comparison site Cable. Government statistics,externalsuggest only 4% of UK premises have a full-fibre link - compared to 79% in Spain and 95% in Portugal. ""We want everyone in the UK to benefit from world-class connectivity, no matter where they live, work or travel,"" said DCMS Secretary Jeremy Wright. ""This radical new blueprint for the future of telecommunications in this country will increase competition and investment in full-fibre broadband, create more commercial opportunities and make it easier and cheaper to roll out infrastructure for 5G."" The DCMS said its plans would ""drive competition and commercial investment in full-fibre networks across as much of the UK as possible"". However, it acknowledged  that in some parts of the country, it was unlikely that the market could deliver by itself. The strategy also aims to boost access to 5G mobile services As a result, the government would support investment in the most difficult-to-reach areas. ""We have already identified around Â£200m within the existing Superfast broadband programme that can further the delivery of full-fibre networks immediately,"" it added. The chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, welcomed the government's review, which he said echoed his commission's own recommendations. ""As well as broadband, this plan will also leave the UK well-placed to introduce the latest 5G mobile technology,"" he added. In a statement, UK infrastructure provider Openreach said it was ""encouraged by the Government's plan to promote competition, tackle red tape and bust the barriers to investment."" However, it said, the economics of cabling up the UK were ""challenging"" for all parties involved. It suggested a review of business rates could help get things moving. Andrew Ferguson, editor of the Think Broadband site, said the strategy turned visions of full-fibre coverage into ""slightly firmer targets"". However, he added, there was one ""very important caveat"" to the strategy which might slow the take up of full-fibre in the UK. In nations such as Spain, he said, full-fibre was the first decent broadband people were offered which meant people enthusiastically signed up. ""Getting the UK to upgrade to full-fibre if they are getting decent speeds from a VDSL2 or cable broadband connection may be harder,"" he said, adding that how the packages were priced would be a factor in adoption. Fitting full-fibre often means engineers have to visit homes to connect them up Dana Tobak, head of full-fibre ISP Hyperoptic, said ""education"" would be an important part of the conversion process as installing the technology in homes and business typically involved more work than existing methods that rely on both copper and fibre. ""We do have to appreciate the physical and work element of full-fibre and we have found that consumers do not yet quite understand that,"" she said. However, she added, the opportunities for novel uses that full-fibre offered would make it an easier sell to many people. ""It's not just about how fast we can download a movie,"" said Ms Tobak. ""That's just a function of how we use it today. ""This commitment from the government will get people building the applications of tomorrow,"" she said.

"The 1963 recording with The Konrads features Bowie performing under his birth name David Jones The first known studio recording of David Bowie is set for auction after being found in an old bread basket. The 1963 demo tape, rejected by Decca, features a 16-year-old Bowie - then known as David Jones - singing I Never Dreamed with first band The Konrads. The tape, expected to fetch Â£10,000, is being sold by the band's drummer David Hadfield, who uncovered it in his loft. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather described the tape as a ""significant recording, completely unique"". This video can not be played A clip of a 1963 recording, thought to be the first, of a teenage David Bowie singing He said it offers new insight into Bowie as a ""fledgling musician who would go on to super stardom."" The recording captures Bowie, later known as one of music's great experimentalists, at a time when he remained unsure of his musical direction. Bowie was The Konrads' saxophonist but it was decided that he should sing lead vocals for the tape. Hadfield said: ""David had no inclination to become a singer at this point, his heart and mind were focused on becoming a world class saxophone player. Bowie went on to become one of the most influential solo artists of all-time ""Our agent, Eric Easton, who also managed the Rolling Stones, asked us to do a demo so he could try and get us an audition at Decca. ""We had decided that we would do a couple of guitar instrumentals and one original song. ""Decca initially turned us down, but when they eventually gave us an audition later that year, vocalist Roger Ferris was the lead voice and David sang backing harmonies."" Bowie left the band shortly after the audition, which did not get the band signed. He would eventually return as a solo artist six years later - changing his name in 1966 once The Monkees' Davy Jones achieved stardom. Signed to Mercury Records, he released Space Oddity - a stand-out on his self-titled second album - in 1969. This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie His global breakthrough came with 1972's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. Following this success, Space Oddity was reissued under RCA records in 1975 and went on to become Bowie's first UK number one. His ever-changing artistic persona would ultimately reshape attitudes to fashion, gender, music and culture.

"This video can not be played Ebony Roberts and Jalisa Andrew: ""We suddenly had to find Â£5,000"" There has been a ""significant"" rise in homes being valued at less than what buyers have agreed to pay, the UK's largest mortgage advisers have said. These ""down valuations"", by lenders, can mean buyers having to pay thousands of pounds extra, up front, to avoid the sale collapsing. Estate agents Emoov said it reflected surveyors predicting a financial crash. UK Finance said lenders, which it represents, were right to ensure property values were realistic. The organisation said borrowers also benefited from houses having an ""independent valuation"". The mortgage advisers London and Country told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the number of advisers that felt down valuations had been on the increase ""outweighs"" those that had seen no change. Emoov, one of the UK's largest digital estate agents, said one in five of its sales now resulted in a down valuation. Two years ago, it was fewer than one in 20, it added. This is the highest rate since the UK's financial crash in 2008, according to agents from 10 mortgage adviser groups contacted by the Victoria Derbyshire programme. Emoov's chief executive Russell Quirk said he believed it was the result of surveyors - who carry out the property valuations for the mortgage providers - ""simply covering their backs"". He added: ""Surveyors are prophesying a [financial] crash. The system is built to protect them."" The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said: ""The market value is based on comparable market evidence, usually a minimum of three sales transactions of similar properties in the local area, and also the professional's knowledge of the local market including supply and demand dynamics. ""For this reason, it is quite possible that the valuation for the lender - the market value - does not match an asking price for a property that has been set by the seller or agent."" After a buyer agrees the price of the house with a seller, the mortgage provider uses a surveyor to check what they believe the house is worth. The surveyor, employed by the mortgage provider, looks at the sale price of similar properties locally, market conditions in the area and the current condition of the property. If the surveyor believes the house is worth less than the agreed sale price, say by Â£10,000, this is known as a ""down valuation"". It means that if the buyer cannot negotiate a new price for the house with the seller, they will have to find the extra Â£10,000 up front or risk losing the house. Those with the smallest deposits and who have remortgaged their house after doing renovation work are most likely to be affected by down valuations. Down valuations have been blamed for an increase in housing chains breaking down across the UK. Ebony Roberts and her fiancee Jalisa Andrews, from Port Talbot in South Wales, have experienced two down valuations while trying to buy their first home together. ""We got right through to the very end stages of buying a house we had our hearts set on... but then we had a problem when the mortgage valuation came back,"" Ms Roberts said. ""We had a down valuation of Â£10,000. The seller would not drop their price, so we lost that house."" Then it happened again, on another property. Worried they would lose that house too, they borrowed Â£5,000 from family members at short notice. ""Our broker even said, 'You're having a bad run,'"" explained Ms Andrews. Phil Broodbank says the surveyor did not look inside his house when valuing it Those remortgaging their houses after doing renovation work are also among those most affected by down valuations. Phil Broodbank, from Wirral, bought his house for Â£180,000 a few years ago and spent up to Â£25,000 renovating it. When the time came to remortgage, a surveyor valued his house at Â£200,000 without visiting it in person - in what is known as a ""drive by"". This valuation was Â£20,000 lower than a local estate agent had valued the property. Mr Broodbank blames the surveyors for what happened. ""They didn't actually take a look at the property. For all they know the inside could be a complete shell."" The surveyor's valuation would have meant Mr Broodbank paying around Â£50 a month extra on his mortgage over five years, as his interest rates would have been higher. Instead, he says he lost hundreds of pounds in fees by choosing to go with another bank, who valued his property at Â£220,000. UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: ""Lenders have a responsibility to ensure that the value of property taken as security on mortgage loans is current and realistic. ""Although the valuation is carried out for the lender, borrowers also benefit from a realistic independent valuation as it could help them avoid paying over the odds for the property they are buying.""

This man off the coast of Whitstable, Kent, has not heeded warnings to stay out of the sun ""We advise the public to take care in the sun, especially when temperatures are potentially reaching 30C or more throughout this week - either stay out of the sun or be sensible and don't go out in the strongest sunshine hours - 11am to 3pm,"" a Met Office spokeswoman said. The public were urged to take the usual precautions in the sun, including covering up, wearing sun screen, keeping your house cool and drinking plenty of water. By David Shukman, BBC science editor Heatwaves are nothing new for the UK. I was struggling through my A-level exams during the blazing weather of 1976 when for 15 days running temperatures were above 32C somewhere in the UK. This year has not matched that. So far, at least. But since those overheated schooldays the planet has changed. The average temperature has risen. And scientists are convinced that we are starting to feel the effects of humanity's greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. They point to the multiple heatwaves under way in different parts of the globe at the same time. While parts of the UK are sweltering, there's stunning warmth in Scandinavia even inside the usually chilly Arctic Circle and in Japan dozens of peoplehave reportedly died from record temperatures. The latest research into the future of the climate does not say that we will get heatwaves every year. The next few summers may well be cool. But studies do suggest that heatwaves will become more frequent, and that when they happen they will last longer than they do now. So children currently enjoying the holiday sunshine may well grow up into a world where heatwaves seem almost normal. The warning follows weeks of dry, hot weather, which has already causeda hosepipe ban,closed canalsand revealedancient hidden landscapes. In 1976, there were 15 days running where somewhere in the UKwas over 32C,external. That record has not been matched by the 2018 heatwave yet In 1969, there were 70 days in one part of Suffolk with less than a millimetre of rain in total. Two places in west London have so far gone 54 days with the same low rainfall The Met Office said the first half of summer has been the driest since 1961. Several parts of the country have had 54 consecutive dry days, meaning less than 1mm of rain fell. The longest run with no rain at all has been 48 days at Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds. The Met Office said most of its weather stations in East Anglia have had no rain at all since 21 June. This video can not be played A GP's advice on staying healthy in the heatwave Guy Smith, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, said crops were ""being parched to the bone"". ""Spring crops that farmers sowed in April barely knowing what rain is,"" he told the BBC. ""As you travel west... a little bit more rain but even here the grass has stopped growing and that's a problem for livestock farmers because they need to have that grass growth to sustain their sheep and cows through to the winter. ""We're hearing that livestock farmers are now having to feed winter rations to their stock and that's going to cause problems later on."" Mr Smith said vegetable farmers also face problems as their reservoirs - used for irrigation - begin to run dry. ""If this weather continues... we will see impacts on vegetable production. The signs are ominous."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We're already anticipating signs of autumn,"" said Kate Lewthwaite from the Woodland Trust.

"Tesco is planning to open a number of stores in a mystery new format. The store chain, the country's biggest food retailer, would not comment, but there are strong hints the new-look stores will be aimed at challenging discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl. A whole range of jobs are on offer at new-format stores in Wandsworth, London, Chatteris, Cambridgeshire and Immingham, Lincolnshire. Reports suggest it could be called Jack's, after Tesco founder Jack Cohen. The job adverts, which are headed ""Tesco - New Store Format"" all contain a line saying: ""The new retail format will be operated separately from the core Tesco business and as such benefits offered will be different from those offered at Tesco."" Tesco's move comes as retailers face an increasingly competitive environment. Since their entry into the UK, discount chains Aldi and Lidl have steadily increased their share of the market and now account for 14% of grocery sales. How UK shoppers fell in love with own brands Iceland tops shopper satisfaction list Tesco trials till-free stores On top of that, internet behemoth Amazon has edged slowly but steadily into food retailing. Last year, Amazon bought upmarket grocer Whole Foods. In the UK, Amazon offers food sales through its Amazon Fresh service, although currently that is still focused on Greater London and parts of the South East. Aldi is one of the discount chains to have made great inroads into the UK's grocery sector The established supermarkets have been trying to stay in the game Earlier this month,Tesco announced it was planning a buying partnership with France's Carrefour- a ""strategic alliance"" whereby the two will try to use their joint buying power to cut costs and offer lower prices to customers. This came after Tesco took over the wholesale giant, Booker. In April, Sainsbury's said that it was in advanced talks to buy Asda from US retail giant Walmart. Some analysts warned any move by Tesco to take on the discounters would need sensitive handling. Thomas Brereton, retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""The possibility of Tesco opening a discount fascia in a bid to neutralise the growing threat posed by German discounters Aldi and Lidl looks a bold move, but orchestrating the emergence of a new brand without damaging the reputation of the main Tesco image will require pinpoint precision to succeed."" That point was echoed by Mark Dodds, chairman of the Chartered Institute of Marketing's Food, Drink and Agriculture committee. ""Getting the branding balance right will be vital if Tesco is to succeed in taking on the discount supermarkets. If the brand is too different it will have a tough job becoming established in the market,"" he said. ""On the other hand a brand too close to its core runs the risk of cannibalisation of current sales."" Last year, Tesco, which employs 440,000 people, reported profits of Â£1.3bn with sales of Â£57.5bn.

"This video can not be played 'It just seemed very surreal' A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman have died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city, police say. Thirteen other people, ranging in age between 10 and 59, were injured in the attack in the Greektown district of Toronto, police chief Mark Saunders told reporters. The suspect, 29, had an exchange of gunfire with police officers before being found dead nearby. The motive for the shooting is unknown. Police have not identified the suspect, who was from Toronto, and it is unclear if he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. The attack happened on Sunday evening. In a video clip shared by Canadian media, a white man wearing a dark cap and dark clothing and carrying a shoulder bag can be seen stopping on a pavement and pulling out a handgun before firing shots. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent his sympathies to the victims and the city in a tweet, while Toronto Mayor John Tory condemned the ""despicable"" attack on ""people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening"".

A number of people were reportedly hurt in a cafe called the Demetres, while others were hit in the street. Det Sgt Terry Browne, who is leading the investigation into the shootings, told reporters on Monday that ""some individuals have what may be described as life-changing injuries"" following the attack. According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street, a short distance from the cafe. ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. Andrew Mantzios had been drinking coffee with friends by the fountain when he heard shots and turned around to see the gunman coming towards his group. ""He had this horrible expression on his face,"" Mr Mantzios was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail. The gunman fired at a crowd of people waiting to cross the street, he said.

"Ryanair says its profits in the April to June quarter have been hit by higher wage costs as the airline faces strikes by staff over pay and conditions. It said higher oil prices and a fall in fares also dented profits, which fell 20% to â¬319m (Â£285m). Ryanair is facing more strikes in the next few days. Pilots in Dublin willstrike on Tuesday, while cabin crew in Europe will strike later this week. Ryanair also said average fares this summer would be lower than expected. It put this down to tough competition, the heatwave in Northern Europe and uncertainty caused by the strikes. Ryanair said staff costs were up by 34% because of a 20% increase in pilot pay, 9% more flight hours and a 3% general pay increase for non-flight staff. However, it said it expected to meet profit forecasts of â¬1.25bn-â¬1.35bn for the full year. Shareholders, though, were disappointed, marking the shares down 5% in morning trading. Staff at the airline are continuing to fight for better pay and conditions. Ireland-based pilots have held two 24-hour walk-outs and are due to hold another one on Tuesday. In addition, this coming week will see 300 of its daily 2,400 flights cancelled on Thursday and Friday because of industrial action by cabin crew in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium. Industrial action has dogged the company for some months. In December last year it said it would recognise trade unions - reversing its previous policy - in an attempt to avoid strike action over the Christmas period. But problems continue, and the airline acknowledged that further disruption was likely. ""While we continue to actively engage with pilot and cabin crew unions across Europe, we expect further strikes over the peak summer period,"" said chief executive Michael O'Leary. The pilots' main concern is over ""seniority lists"", a system used by many airlines to determine a number of things within an airline, including which aircraft type a pilot flies and their schedule. Cabin crew are taking action over a whole host of issues, including pay. Among other things, they are asking for a ""fair living wage"" and employment contracts written in their own language, based on local, rather than Irish, law. The airline also said it was concerned about the danger of a hard Brexit, warning that the risk of one was being ""underestimated"". It warned UK shareholders they may have to lose their voting rights in the event of a hard Brexit. Ryanair said: ""While there is a view that a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), recent events in the UK political sphere have added to this uncertainty, and we believe that the risk of a hard Brexit is being underestimated. ""It is likely that in the event of a hard Brexit our UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU. ""We may be forced to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that Ryanair remains majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders.""

""And of course Britain doesn't want to unnecessarily complicate framework conditions for economic activity, but also security questions, or our foreign policy cooperation.

The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work afterwards. Mr Hunt's trip to Germany comes at the start of a concerted push by British government ministers to sell the UK's latest Brexit blueprint across the Continent. Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? Prime Minister Theresa May will meet the Austrian chancellor and Czech and Estonian prime ministers this week, saying both sides know ""the clock is ticking"" on negotiations. The EU and the UK want a deal in place by October. This video can not be played Theresa May is asked how she unwinds Speaking to workers at a factory in Newcastle, Mrs May said she was working to get a deal that MPs would support when it comes before Parliament - but was also ""stepping up"" government preparations for no deal being reached. She was asked about Treasury forecasts of an economic hit to the North East of England after Brexit - in response she said the government wanted ""frictionless"" trade at borders and also promised investment in transport infrastructure and skills. And asked how she unwinds from the ""world's most stressful job"", she said she enjoyed walking, cooking and watching US crime TV series NCIS. This video can not be played Three politicians give their view on a Brexit ""no deal"" The government's plan has been set out in a White Paper which proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement of people and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise, which would leave the UK governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. The plan sparked two cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. After Parliament rises for the summer recess on Tuesday, Downing Street said the UK negotiating team would be travelling to Brussels while the foreign secretary, chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office will meet counterparts across Europe. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. He questioned whether the plans could work without causing extra bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected. New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said a deal could be done by October - but also that making ""no deal"" preparations such as hiring extra border staff was part of being a ""responsible government"". The Times has reported that the head of Amazon in the UK, Doug Gurr,warned of potential ""civil unrest"",externalin the event of ""no deal"" at a meeting with Mr Raab on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it seemed the government's priority was preparing for no deal, which would be bad for industry. ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade,"" he said. Brexit deal can be done by October - Raab What happens now that a deal's been done?

"UK drivers are being urged to test their eyesight after a DVLA survey suggested 50% of motorists were not aware of theminimum standards,externalneeded for a licence. Drivers must be able to read a number plate from 20m (65ft) away. But the agency's survey found only half of drivers knew about the eye test and used it to regularly self-check, as they are legally required to do. Those who do not pass the test should visit an optician, a DVLA doctor said. Learner drivers must pass the eye test as part of their practical exam - and are then legally obliged to ensure their sight remains good enough to drive thereafter. The DVLA's Wyn Parry warned vision can ""naturally deteriorate over time"", adding that regular checks to ensure good eyesight were ""essential for safe driving"". Drivers 'should have compulsory eye tests every decade' Number of drivers aged over 90 tops 100,000 for first time Driver 'blamed Specsavers' after fatal crash Performing the test can be done on any street and only takes ""a couple of seconds"", said Dr Parry. Five car lengths is said to roughly match the 20m distance, with drivers being encouraged to use the measure to test their vision on the number plates of passing cars. There are currently 48 million registered drivers in the UK, according to the DVLA. Last year, the Association of Optometrists called for those behind the wheel to havecompulsory eye tests every 10 years. One in three optometrists said they had seen patients who continue to drive with vision below the legal standard, the association said. Drivers over the age of 70 must actively make a declaration every three years that they are fit to drive - but do not actually have to pass a test.

"This video can not be played The bank will house its technology, functions and operations teams at the new hub Barclays has unveiled plans to create up to 2,500 jobs at a new hub in Glasgow, in a major boost to Scotland's financial services sector. The bank will house its technology, functions and operations teams at a campus at the planned Buchanan Wharf development on the banks of the Clyde. Barclays said it would ""play a pivotal role"" in its ""long-term strategic priorities"". The move would double Barclays' current workforce in Scotland. Barclays has agreed to purchase the campus development from Drum Property Group and is currently finalising the design of the new facility as part of the wider Buchanan Wharf development. The bank's existing Scottish operations are expected to start transferring to the new campus from 2021. Barclays says up to 5,000 staff will be based at the new Buchanan Wharf campus Scottish Enterprise has agreed to provide a grant of Â£12.75m towards the project. The offer requires that at least 42% of the new jobs are of ""high value"", with at least 341 posts made available for disadvantaged workers or those who have a disability. The development will make the bank one of Glasgow's largest commercial employers. Paul Compton, chief operating officer at Barclays, said: ""The Glasgow campus, alongside others in Whippany, New Jersey, and Pune, India, is part of a global strategy to create world-class facilities for our functions, technology and operations teams. ""This new campus at Buchanan Wharf is a flagship project for the bank, which builds on Barclays' long history in Scotland and clearly demonstrates our commitment to supporting the UK economy."" Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the project would be ""transformational for Glasgow"". ""This is fantastic news for Glasgow. This is the kind of investment that will create lots of jobs ... but it is also the kind of investment that will be transformational for this part of the city. ""It is likely to act as a magnet for other investment that will see the regeneration of a part of Glasgow that has long needed it."" She added: ""The new campus will strengthen Glasgow's financial services sector and shows Scotland continues to be a highly attractive location for inward investment. ""I am particularly pleased that as part of this investment, Barclays has committed to employing local people who often face barriers into work, including those with disabilities and young people."" How the site in Tradeston looks at the moment Paul Lewis, from Scottish Enterprise, said: ""This investment establishes Glasgow as a key global site for Barclays, providing a platform for growth whilst also securing existing operations in Scotland. ""It will breathe new life into a part of the city with huge potential and bring significant new jobs, including employment specifically for disadvantaged workers."" Buchanan Wharf is a major mixed-use scheme currently being developed by Drum Property Group. Drum managing director Graeme Bone said the project was ""setting a new benchmark for large scale development across Scotland"" He added: ""Our development will be one of Scotland's largest single-site construction projects, bringing together over a million square feet of prime Grade A office space with residential accommodation, and an exciting mix of amenities and landscaped public spaces."" The prospect of up to 2,500 more Barclays jobs in Glasgow is very good news for the city in several ways, but it should also be treated with some caution: It is a decision being made by an employer that isn't taking a risk on Glasgow's workforce, but making a judgement on a pool of labour that it already knows well. That's a big vote of confidence. It sends a strong signal to others in the sector to look to the Scottish workforce for back office and technology roles, including those at the higher end. That's particularly true of those looking to move to locations with lower costs than London. HSBC has chosen Birmingham for a new base. The message will travel beyond an audience of senior managers in the UK. While other banks have shrunk their global ambitions, Barclays is making its strategic choices across three continents. The city centre is badly in need of a regenerative lift, particularly the Tradeston district, where too many blocks are empty or decaying. The move will focus attention more on the riverfront, which has had substantial investment, but has not yet become a focus for city life. The outline plan for Buchanan Wharf is to have enough office space for 7,000 people, and 300 new homes, so in time, Barclays' development ought to bring along that additional capacity. But two words of caution: the numbers are ""up to 2,500 jobs"". And as some of them are being relocated from London and possibly elsewhere, Glasgow will still have to fight and make its case if that potential number is to be reached. The other: banking is changing very fast, and the pace is about to pick up. Many jobs are vulnerable to being replaced by technological advances. While some of those will be developed by Barclays' workforce in Glasgow, those working in the sector can't afford to be complacent. Expect continuing employment churn.

"A new drug to treat malaria has been given the green light by authorities in the United States. The medicine is specifically for the recurring form of malaria - caused by the parasite plasmodium vivax - which makes 8.5 million people ill each year. This type of malaria is a particular challenge to get rid of as it can remain dormant in the liver for years before reawakening many times. Scientists have described tafenoquine as a ""phenomenal achievement."" Regulators around the world will now look at the drug to see if they can recommend it for their populations. Recurring malaria is the most common type of malaria outside Sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be particularly at risk, getting several bouts of malaria from a single bite, missing lots of school and getting weaker each time they get the disease. And infected people can act as unwitting reservoirs of the disease because when the parasite reawakens in their bodies a mosquito can carry that parasite on to someone else. This can make it hard to eliminate around the world. Now the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has given the seal of approval to tafenoquine, a drug that can flush the parasite out of its hiding place in the liver and stop people getting it again. It can be taken alongside another medicine to treat the immediate infection. There is already a medication that can be used to get rid of malaria hiding in the liver called primaquine. But unlike the single dose of tafenoquine needed, primaquine often needs to be taken for 14 days. Some experts are concerned that many people feel better after just a few days and stop taking the pills, allowing the parasite to awaken at a later date. The FDA says the drug is effective and approves it for use in the United States but points out that there are important side effects to be aware of. For example people with an enzyme problem, called G6PD deficiency, should not take the drug as it can cause severe anaemia. The regulator recommends people are tested for the deficiency for this before it is given - which can pose a problem in poorer areas where malaria is common. There are also concerns that at higher doses it can be a problem for people with psychiatric illnesses. But despite these cautions there is hope the drug, together with bed nets and other precautions, will help reduce the amount of vivax malaria in the world. Prof Ric Price, of Oxford University, told the BBC: ""The ability to get rid of the parasite in the liver with a single dose of tafenoquine is a phenomenal achievement and in my mind it represents one of the most significant advances in malaria treatment in the last 60 years."" Meanwhile Dr Hal Barron, president of research and development at GSK, the company that manufactures the drug, said it was a significant milestone for people living with this type of relapsing malaria. ""Together with our partner, Medicines for Malaria Venture, we believe Krintafel will be an important medicine for patients with malaria and contribute to the ongoing effort to eradicate this disease."" Tafenonquine has been in existence since the 1970s but working with Medicines for Malaria, GSK has repurposed the drug so that it can be used to get rid of malaria parasites in the liver. The next step will be for the drug to be assessed by regulators in countries where this form of malaria is a significant problem.

"Full-fibre broadband should be fitted as standard in all new homes, the government has said. The proposal comes as part of anew national telecoms strategy,externaldrawn up by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Under its targets, all of the UK will have full-fibre broadband coverage by 2033, replacing the copper wire network that currently delivers the service. It proposes legislation to encourage more private infrastructure investment. Earlier this month, research was published indicating thatthe UK has slipped from 31st to 35th placein the global broadband league tables, behind 25 other European countries. The data was collected by M-Lab, a partnership between Google Open Source Research and Princeton University's PlantLab, and theresults compiled,externalby UK broadband comparison site Cable. Government statistics,externalsuggest only 4% of UK premises have a full-fibre link - compared to 79% in Spain and 95% in Portugal. ""We want everyone in the UK to benefit from world-class connectivity, no matter where they live, work or travel,"" said DCMS Secretary Jeremy Wright. ""This radical new blueprint for the future of telecommunications in this country will increase competition and investment in full-fibre broadband, create more commercial opportunities and make it easier and cheaper to roll out infrastructure for 5G."" The DCMS said its plans would ""drive competition and commercial investment in full-fibre networks across as much of the UK as possible"". However, it acknowledged  that in some parts of the country, it was unlikely that the market could deliver by itself. The strategy also aims to boost access to 5G mobile services As a result, the government would support investment in the most difficult-to-reach areas. ""We have already identified around Â£200m within the existing Superfast broadband programme that can further the delivery of full-fibre networks immediately,"" it added. The chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, Sir John Armitt, welcomed the government's review, which he said echoed his commission's own recommendations. ""As well as broadband, this plan will also leave the UK well-placed to introduce the latest 5G mobile technology,"" he added. In a statement, UK infrastructure provider Openreach said it was ""encouraged by the Government's plan to promote competition, tackle red tape and bust the barriers to investment."" However, it said, the economics of cabling up the UK were ""challenging"" for all parties involved. It suggested a review of business rates could help get things moving. Andrew Ferguson, editor of the Think Broadband site, said the strategy turned visions of full-fibre coverage into ""slightly firmer targets"". However, he added, there was one ""very important caveat"" to the strategy which might slow the take up of full-fibre in the UK. In nations such as Spain, he said, full-fibre was the first decent broadband people were offered which meant people enthusiastically signed up. ""Getting the UK to upgrade to full-fibre if they are getting decent speeds from a VDSL2 or cable broadband connection may be harder,"" he said, adding that how the packages were priced would be a factor in adoption. Fitting full-fibre often means engineers have to visit homes to connect them up Dana Tobak, head of full-fibre ISP Hyperoptic, said ""education"" would be an important part of the conversion process as installing the technology in homes and business typically involved more work than existing methods that rely on both copper and fibre. ""We do have to appreciate the physical and work element of full-fibre and we have found that consumers do not yet quite understand that,"" she said. However, she added, the opportunities for novel uses that full-fibre offered would make it an easier sell to many people. ""It's not just about how fast we can download a movie,"" said Ms Tobak. ""That's just a function of how we use it today. ""This commitment from the government will get people building the applications of tomorrow,"" she said. ""It will fundamentally change lives as we get used to it.""

"This video can not be played A student activist filmed a woman and a man being beaten on 1 May France's interior minister has been grilled by MPs over his handling of a policing scandal in which a presidential security aide was filmed assaulting a demonstrator on 1 May. GÃ©rard Collomb said he learned of the video on 2 May and did not report it to prosecutors because it was a matter for President Emmanuel Macron's staff. Mr Macron fired the aide, Alexandre Benalla, on Friday, but MPs want to know why he did not act sooner. Mr Benalla, 26, faces several charges. He is accused of assault with an accomplice, interfering in police work, impersonating a police officer and illegally receiving surveillance footage. On Monday Mr Benalla, who was Mr Macron's top bodyguard during last year's election campaign, defended his actions, claiming that he was ""lending a hand"" to the riot officers at the scene after he was ""invited to observe"" their operations. He added that he believed his behaviour was being exploited for ""media and political ends"", his lawyers said. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla pictured together on Bastille Day this month Vincent Crase, a security agent for Mr Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party, has also been charged. Three police officers were charged and questioned on Saturdayfor allegedly passing surveillance footage to Mr Benalla to try to prove his innocence. Mr Collomb told MPs: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of Mr Benalla."" He said his staff had informed Mr Macron's administration about the incident and ""it was up to them to respond"". ""I did not pursue this matter any further."" Besides the MPs' inquiry, the police disciplinary body, IGPN, is also investigating the assault. Interior Minister Collomb (R) said he had assumed Mr Benalla was a regular policeman The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris writes: There is no private militia at the ElysÃ©e Palace. People can sense that the real culprit is Alexandre Benalla himself, who for a self-declared security officer showed himself disgracefully lacking in self-control. But it is also true that President Macron will not emerge unscathed. His silence has come across as a sort of majestic insouciance, which irritates. Read Hugh's analysis in full here. The French presidency has been accused of trying to cover up the assault and failing to act swiftly against Mr Benalla. Mr Macron is already under scrutiny over what some see as an elitist presidential style: there have been controversies overhis expensive new dinner serviceandplans for a private swimming pool. Public outrage has been stoked by additional footage that appears to show several police officers watching the Benalla incident without intervening. The video shows Mr Benalla dragging away a woman and then beating a man during May Day protests in Paris. Read related stories on this topic: Paris police hold 109 May Day rioters State sector reforms spark French strike Macron's meteoric rise - in depth Mr Macron has ordered a staff shake-up. Under growing pressure, he met several ministers on Sunday to discuss the row. An official said Mr Macron had described the incident as ""unacceptable"" and promised there would be ""no impunity"". But Mr Macron has not yet spoken publicly about it. Senior presidential official Alexis Kohler is to look into reorganising Mr Macron's private office so as to prevent a repeat of the incident, officials say. The video was posted on social media in May, but the case only became a political scandal after Le Monde newspaper revealed on 18 July that the attacker was Mr Benalla. He was hired as an aide to the president's chief of staff after last year's election. He was then given an apartment in an upmarket Paris district and a chauffeur-driven car, French media say. He also had the highest security clearance to parliament. In May, a few days after the incident, he was suspended for two weeks but nothing was reported to prosecutors. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot in Paris' Latin Quarter, whereabout 100 people had gathered during demonstrations against Mr Macron's public sector labour reforms- in particular the cutting of public sector workers and the introduction of merit-based pay. Police later said that about 1,200 masked and hooded individuals attended the 1 May demonstration by labour unions before clashes erupted with officers policing the event. Allow Twitter content?

Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking a male protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground.

"This video can not be played Margaret Hodge says she is ""incredibly upset"" at Labour's anti-Semitism row Labour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge has stood by her criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over anti-Semitism - as MPs defied the party's executive on the issue. ""I blew my top,"" Dame Margaret said, describing her reaction to Labour adopting new anti-Semitism guidelines. Labour MPs want the party to adopt theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,externaldefinition of anti-Semitism, as well as all the examples it lists. Labour says its version ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA definition. MPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism code Labour to 'get it right' on anti-Semitism How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Labour's new code of conduct was approved by its National Executive Committee last week, but it was criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs. Although it includes the definition of anti-Semitism given by the IHRA, it has not incorporated all of the IHRA's ""working examples"". Labour MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the 5 September ballot was likely to put Labour MPs on a collision course with the party machine. Labour has already said it will ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups. Dame Margaret is facing Labour disciplinary action after confronting Mr Corbyn in the Commons last week, reportedly swearing at him and calling him an anti-Semite. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, she said that when she found out Labour had, despite criticism, adopted the new guidelines: ""I blew my top. ""And I thought rather than do what politicians usually do, and talk each other down behind our backs, I would go and confront him."" She said she told him that ""for Jewish people to vote Labour was becoming exceedingly tough"". Mr Corbyn has said he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"" Earlier, the Barking MP insisted she would not leave the party, saying: ""I am going to fight within the Labour Party - and it is terrible that in 2018 I have to do that."" Mr Corbyn has said he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"". ""Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party,"" he said earlier this year. The Labour leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, said there was no point agreeing a definition of anti-Semitism if it alienated the Jewish community. She told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that adopting the full international definition was ""the way forward"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The code does reproduce the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples provided by the IHRA definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis But Labour has insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code. Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country. And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation.

This video can not be played Shadow Solicitor-General Nick Thomas-Symonds: Labour making code ""stronger and legally enforceable"" Labour's code says: ""The party is clear that the Jewish people have the same right to self-determination as any other people. ""To deny that right is to treat the Jewish people unequally and is therefore a form of anti-Semitism."" The code also says Israel's conduct should be assessed ""against the requirements of international law or the standards of behaviour expected of democratic states"" and that double standards should not be applied. A party spokeswoman said: ""The code of conduct adopts the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition and expands on and contextualises the IHRA examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases.""

"This video can not be played A student activist filmed a woman and a man being beaten on 1 May France's interior minister has been grilled by MPs over his handling of a policing scandal in which a presidential security aide was filmed assaulting a demonstrator on 1 May. GÃ©rard Collomb said he learned of the video on 2 May and did not report it to prosecutors because it was a matter for President Emmanuel Macron's staff. Mr Macron fired the aide, Alexandre Benalla, on Friday, but MPs want to know why he did not act sooner. Mr Benalla, 26, faces several charges. He is accused of assault with an accomplice, interfering in police work, impersonating a police officer and illegally receiving surveillance footage. On Monday Mr Benalla, who was Mr Macron's top bodyguard during last year's election campaign, defended his actions, claiming that he was ""lending a hand"" to the riot officers at the scene after he was ""invited to observe"" their operations. He added that he believed his behaviour was being exploited for ""media and political ends"", his lawyers said. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla pictured together on Bastille Day this month Vincent Crase, a security agent for Mr Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party, has also been charged. Three police officers were charged and questioned on Saturdayfor allegedly passing surveillance footage to Mr Benalla to try to prove his innocence. Mr Collomb told MPs: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of Mr Benalla."" He said his staff had informed Mr Macron's administration about the incident and ""it was up to them to respond"". ""I did not pursue this matter any further."" Besides the MPs' inquiry, the police disciplinary body, IGPN, is also investigating the assault. Interior Minister Collomb (R) said he had assumed Mr Benalla was a regular policeman The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris writes: There is no private militia at the ElysÃ©e Palace. People can sense that the real culprit is Alexandre Benalla himself, who for a self-declared security officer showed himself disgracefully lacking in self-control. But it is also true that President Macron will not emerge unscathed. His silence has come across as a sort of majestic insouciance, which irritates. Read Hugh's analysis in full here. The French presidency has been accused of trying to cover up the assault and failing to act swiftly against Mr Benalla. Mr Macron is already under scrutiny over what some see as an elitist presidential style: there have been controversies overhis expensive new dinner serviceandplans for a private swimming pool. Public outrage has been stoked by additional footage that appears to show several police officers watching the Benalla incident without intervening.

But Mr Macron has not yet spoken publicly about it. Senior presidential official Alexis Kohler is to look into reorganising Mr Macron's private office so as to prevent a repeat of the incident, officials say. The video was posted on social media in May, but the case only became a political scandal after Le Monde newspaper revealed on 18 July that the attacker was Mr Benalla.

He also had the highest security clearance to parliament. In May, a few days after the incident, he was suspended for two weeks but nothing was reported to prosecutors. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot in Paris' Latin Quarter, whereabout 100 people had gathered during demonstrations against Mr Macron's public sector labour reforms- in particular the cutting of public sector workers and the introduction of merit-based pay. Police later said that about 1,200 masked and hooded individuals attended the 1 May demonstration by labour unions before clashes erupted with officers policing the event. Allow Twitter content?

"A new drug to treat malaria has been given the green light by authorities in the United States. The medicine is specifically for the recurring form of malaria - caused by the parasite plasmodium vivax - which makes 8.5 million people ill each year. This type of malaria is a particular challenge to get rid of as it can remain dormant in the liver for years before reawakening many times. Scientists have described tafenoquine as a ""phenomenal achievement."" Regulators around the world will now look at the drug to see if they can recommend it for their populations. Recurring malaria is the most common type of malaria outside Sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be particularly at risk, getting several bouts of malaria from a single bite, missing lots of school and getting weaker each time they get the disease. And infected people can act as unwitting reservoirs of the disease because when the parasite reawakens in their bodies a mosquito can carry that parasite on to someone else. This can make it hard to eliminate around the world. Now the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has given the seal of approval to tafenoquine, a drug that can flush the parasite out of its hiding place in the liver and stop people getting it again. It can be taken alongside another medicine to treat the immediate infection. There is already a medication that can be used to get rid of malaria hiding in the liver called primaquine. But unlike the single dose of tafenoquine needed, primaquine often needs to be taken for 14 days. Some experts are concerned that many people feel better after just a few days and stop taking the pills, allowing the parasite to awaken at a later date. The FDA says the drug is effective and approves it for use in the United States but points out that there are important side effects to be aware of. For example people with an enzyme problem, called G6PD deficiency, should not take the drug as it can cause severe anaemia. The regulator recommends people are tested for the deficiency for this before it is given - which can pose a problem in poorer areas where malaria is common. There are also concerns that at higher doses it can be a problem for people with psychiatric illnesses. But despite these cautions there is hope the drug, together with bed nets and other precautions, will help reduce the amount of vivax malaria in the world. Prof Ric Price, of Oxford University, told the BBC: ""The ability to get rid of the parasite in the liver with a single dose of tafenoquine is a phenomenal achievement and in my mind it represents one of the most significant advances in malaria treatment in the last 60 years."" Meanwhile Dr Hal Barron, president of research and development at GSK, the company that manufactures the drug, said it was a significant milestone for people living with this type of relapsing malaria. ""Together with our partner, Medicines for Malaria Venture, we believe Krintafel will be an important medicine for patients with malaria and contribute to the ongoing effort to eradicate this disease."" Tafenonquine has been in existence since the 1970s but working with Medicines for Malaria, GSK has repurposed the drug so that it can be used to get rid of malaria parasites in the liver. The next step will be for the drug to be assessed by regulators in countries where this form of malaria is a significant problem.

"This video can not be played Three politicians give their view on a Brexit ""no deal"" A deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"". But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn. Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer. Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor, Czech prime minister and Estonian prime minister next week. Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it."" Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled. And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. ""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on."" Barnier questions May's Brexit plan What would a 'no deal' Brexit look like? Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed. Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure."" Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"". But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless. Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue. He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said. Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade."" Baptism of fire for UK's new Brexit minister Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Earlier, Mr Raabsuggested to the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about Â£39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis. The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,told the Sunday Express,externalthe government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans.

"The new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab unveiled the White Paper on Thursday The government has published its long-awaitedBrexit White Paper,external. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit. TheWhite Paper is split into four chapters,external: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship. So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean. This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need toavoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas. If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise. There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal? Reality Check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU forroughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found. The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants. Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

"This video can not be played A student activist filmed a woman and a man being beaten on 1 May France's interior minister has been grilled by MPs over his handling of a policing scandal in which a presidential security aide was filmed assaulting a demonstrator on 1 May. GÃ©rard Collomb said he learned of the video on 2 May and did not report it to prosecutors because it was a matter for President Emmanuel Macron's staff. Mr Macron fired the aide, Alexandre Benalla, on Friday, but MPs want to know why he did not act sooner. Mr Benalla, 26, faces several charges. He is accused of assault with an accomplice, interfering in police work, impersonating a police officer and illegally receiving surveillance footage. On Monday Mr Benalla, who was Mr Macron's top bodyguard during last year's election campaign, defended his actions, claiming that he was ""lending a hand"" to the riot officers at the scene after he was ""invited to observe"" their operations. He added that he believed his behaviour was being exploited for ""media and political ends"", his lawyers said. Mr Macron and Mr Benalla pictured together on Bastille Day this month Vincent Crase, a security agent for Mr Macron's La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party, has also been charged. Three police officers were charged and questioned on Saturdayfor allegedly passing surveillance footage to Mr Benalla to try to prove his innocence. Mr Collomb told MPs: ""I condemn in the strongest possible terms the actions of Mr Benalla."" He said his staff had informed Mr Macron's administration about the incident and ""it was up to them to respond"". ""I did not pursue this matter any further."" Besides the MPs' inquiry, the police disciplinary body, IGPN, is also investigating the assault. Interior Minister Collomb (R) said he had assumed Mr Benalla was a regular policeman The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris writes: There is no private militia at the ElysÃ©e Palace. People can sense that the real culprit is Alexandre Benalla himself, who for a self-declared security officer showed himself disgracefully lacking in self-control. But it is also true that President Macron will not emerge unscathed. His silence has come across as a sort of majestic insouciance, which irritates. Read Hugh's analysis in full here. The French presidency has been accused of trying to cover up the assault and failing to act swiftly against Mr Benalla. Mr Macron is already under scrutiny over what some see as an elitist presidential style: there have been controversies overhis expensive new dinner serviceandplans for a private swimming pool. Public outrage has been stoked by additional footage that appears to show several police officers watching the Benalla incident without intervening. The video shows Mr Benalla dragging away a woman and then beating a man during May Day protests in Paris. Read related stories on this topic: Paris police hold 109 May Day rioters State sector reforms spark French strike Macron's meteoric rise - in depth Mr Macron has ordered a staff shake-up. Under growing pressure, he met several ministers on Sunday to discuss the row. An official said Mr Macron had described the incident as ""unacceptable"" and promised there would be ""no impunity"". But Mr Macron has not yet spoken publicly about it. Senior presidential official Alexis Kohler is to look into reorganising Mr Macron's private office so as to prevent a repeat of the incident, officials say. The video was posted on social media in May, but the case only became a political scandal after Le Monde newspaper revealed on 18 July that the attacker was Mr Benalla. He was hired as an aide to the president's chief of staff after last year's election. He was then given an apartment in an upmarket Paris district and a chauffeur-driven car, French media say. He also had the highest security clearance to parliament. In May, a few days after the incident, he was suspended for two weeks but nothing was reported to prosecutors. The incident took place in a popular tourist spot in Paris' Latin Quarter, whereabout 100 people had gathered during demonstrations against Mr Macron's public sector labour reforms- in particular the cutting of public sector workers and the introduction of merit-based pay. Police later said that about 1,200 masked and hooded individuals attended the 1 May demonstration by labour unions before clashes erupted with officers policing the event. Allow Twitter content?

In the original video of the assault, footage shows a man wearing a police helmet, but no uniform, joining CRS riot police as they tried to control the crowds. He grabs a woman by the neck, dragging her down the street, before both disappear off camera. Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking a male protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground. The man in the helmet can be seen grabbing the young protester around the neck, hitting him on the head and apparently stamping on his stomach when he falls to the ground.

"This video can not be played 'It just seemed very surreal' A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman have died after a gunman opened fire on a busy avenue in Canada's largest city, police say. Thirteen other people, ranging in age between 10 and 59, were injured in the attack in the Greektown district of Toronto, police chief Mark Saunders told reporters. The suspect, 29, had an exchange of gunfire with police officers before being found dead nearby. The motive for the shooting is unknown. Police have not identified the suspect, who was from Toronto, and it is unclear if he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. The attack happened on Sunday evening. In a video clip shared by Canadian media, a white man wearing a dark cap and dark clothing and carrying a shoulder bag can be seen stopping on a pavement and pulling out a handgun before firing shots. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent his sympathies to the victims and the city in a tweet, while Toronto Mayor John Tory condemned the ""despicable"" attack on ""people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening"".

The man was apprehended and arrested, Department of National Defence official Daniel Le Bouthillietold the Otawa Citizen,external. Emergency services were called out just after 22:00 (02:00 GMT Monday). The site of the attack is a piazza with a fountain that is popular with local people and was busy at the time, the Toronto Globe and Mail writes. A number of people were reportedly hurt in a cafe called the Demetres, while others were hit in the street. Det Sgt Terry Browne, who is leading the investigation into the shootings, told reporters on Monday that ""some individuals have what may be described as life-changing injuries"" following the attack. According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which looks into incidents involving police which result in death, the gunman was tracked by officers to Bowden Street, a short distance from the cafe. ""An exchange of gunfire"" then took place, before the man fled once more. He was found dead about 100m (328ft) away on Danforth Avenue. Andrew Mantzios had been drinking coffee with friends by the fountain when he heard shots and turned around to see the gunman coming towards his group. ""He had this horrible expression on his face,"" Mr Mantzios was quoted as saying by the Globe and Mail. The gunman fired at a crowd of people waiting to cross the street, he said. ""And then a lady tried to run and she fell down. He turned around and shot her point blank, two or three times.""

The neighbourhood is the closest residential area to the city's downtown core and she says it's a close-knit community.

Local member of Parliament, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, confirmed that she was one of the two killed in the shooting. Reese Fallon Mr Erskine Smith told media that the family was ""devastated"" and was asking for privacy at this time. ""She was a local young Liberal, smart, passionate and full of energy,"" the Liberal MP told the BBC in a statement. ""It is a huge loss."" Ms Fallon was a recent high school graduate and, in a statement, the Toronto District School Board said they were ""heartbroken"" by the news.

Jessica Young, an employee at the Second Cup cafe, said she had seen the gunman's face before he fired through the window. She told the Toronto Star newspaper: ""He was probably no taller than me, wearing a black baseball cap, dark clothes. He had light skin. I think he had short facial hair.

Jessica Young, an employee at the Second Cup cafe, said she had seen the gunman's face before he fired through the window. She told the Toronto Star newspaper: ""He was probably no taller than me, wearing a black baseball cap, dark clothes. He had light skin. I think he had short facial hair. That's all I could make out."" Nobody was hurt in her cafe, she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Three politicians give their view on a Brexit ""no deal"" A deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"". But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn. Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer. Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor, Czech prime minister and Estonian prime minister next week. Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it."" Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled. And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. ""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on."" Barnier questions May's Brexit plan What would a 'no deal' Brexit look like? Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed. Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure."" Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"". But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless. Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue. He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said. Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade."" Baptism of fire for UK's new Brexit minister Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Earlier, Mr Raabsuggested to the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about Â£39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis. The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson,told the Sunday Express,externalthe government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans.

"Jeremy Hunt has warned that without a ""change in approach from the EU negotiators"", there is now a ""very real risk of a Brexit no deal by accident"". The foreign secretary said ""many"" in the EU believed they just had to ""wait long enough and Britain will blink"" but ""that's not going to happen"". He warned of ""unintended geopolitical consequences"" with just Vladimir Putin ""rejoicing"" if there was no deal. Germany's foreign minister says it wants a deal ""not a disorderly Brexit"". Brexit deal 'can be done by October' Barnier questions May's Brexit plan What would a 'no deal' Brexit look like? Heiko Maas, who held talks with Mr Hunt in Berlin, said: ""We know that everyone has to make mutual concessions to get this deal. ""We know that the European Union has its interests, overall interests, so not just individual member-states but EU institutions. ""And of course Britain doesn't want to unnecessarily complicate framework conditions for economic activity, but also security questions, or our foreign policy cooperation. ""It becomes more difficult anyway as a non-member of the European Union. ""So, we've agreed we will prepare bilaterally for the time after Brexit."" Mr Hunt said a no deal would be ""challenging"" but the UK would still ""thrive economically"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work afterwards. Mr Hunt's trip to Germany comes at the start of a concerted push by British government ministers to sell the UK's latest Brexit blueprint across the Continent. Brexit: All you need to know What does UK White Paper reveal? Prime Minister Theresa May will meet the Austrian chancellor and Czech and Estonian prime ministers this week, saying both sides know ""the clock is ticking"" on negotiations. The EU and the UK want a deal in place by October. This video can not be played Theresa May is asked how she unwinds Speaking to workers at a factory in Newcastle, Mrs May said she was working to get a deal that MPs would support when it comes before Parliament - but was also ""stepping up"" government preparations for no deal being reached. She was asked about Treasury forecasts of an economic hit to the North East of England after Brexit - in response she said the government wanted ""frictionless"" trade at borders and also promised investment in transport infrastructure and skills. And asked how she unwinds from the ""world's most stressful job"", she said she enjoyed walking, cooking and watching US crime TV series NCIS. This video can not be played Three politicians give their view on a Brexit ""no deal"" The government's plan has been set out in a White Paper which proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement of people and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise, which would leave the UK governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules. The plan sparked two cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. After Parliament rises for the summer recess on Tuesday, Downing Street said the UK negotiating team would be travelling to Brussels while the foreign secretary, chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office will meet counterparts across Europe. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market. He questioned whether the plans could work without causing extra bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected. New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said a deal could be done by October - but also that making ""no deal"" preparations such as hiring extra border staff was part of being a ""responsible government"". The Times has reported that the head of Amazon in the UK, Doug Gurr,warned of potential ""civil unrest"",externalin the event of ""no deal"" at a meeting with Mr Raab on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it seemed the government's priority was preparing for no deal, which would be bad for industry.
