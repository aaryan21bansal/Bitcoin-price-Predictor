"This video can not be played Extreme heat builds again in North America Extreme heat is building in the western United States, with forecasts of record-breaking temperatures in the states of California and Nevada. It comes just weeks after another dangerous heatwave hit North America, and the region has experienced the hottest June on record. California's Death Valley on Friday recorded a high of 54.4C (130F), with similar heat expected this weekend. Millions of people in the US are under warnings of excessive heat. The National Weather Service has advised those affected to drink plenty of water and stay in air conditioned buildings. The temperature in Death Valley on Friday matched one recorded in August 2020 - which some argue is the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth. A temperature of 56.7C (134F) was recorded in 1913, but this is contested by climate experts. Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes A really simple guide to climate change Firefighters battling the many wildfires in the region say the air is so dry that much of the water dropped by aircraft to quell the flames evaporates before it reaches the ground. In the north of Nevada, near the border with California, people were evacuated from their homes as wildfires triggered by lightning strikes tore through parts of the Sierra Nevada forest region. Forecasters say Las Vegas's record of 47.2C (117F) could also be passed. In Oregon, more evacuation orders were issued when a wildfire fanned by strong winds in the Fremont-Winema National Forest grew from nearly 26 sq miles (67 sq km) on Thursday to nearly 61 sq miles on Friday. The heatwave has left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave The fire was threatening power cables that send electricity to California. Power grid operators in California have urged customers to conserve electricity by reducing their use of appliances and to keep thermostats higher during the evening when solar energy is diminished or no longer available. In Idaho, Governor Brad Little declared a wildfire emergency and mobilised the state's National Guard to help fight fires also sparked by lightning. Canada is also bracing for extreme heat, though it is not expected to approach the temperatures seen at the end of last month when the village Lytton in British Columbia reached 49.6C (121F), breaking the country's highest recorded temperature. The heatwave saw spikes in sudden deaths and increases in hospital visits for heat-related illnesses. Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. But linking any single event to global warming is complicated. A study by climate researchers said the heat that scorched western Canada and the US at the end of Junewas ""virtually impossible"" without climate change.

"G20 finance ministers have backed an ""historic"" plan which will see multinational companies pay their ""fair share"" of tax around the world. The plan to battle tax avoidance puts in place a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15%. It is likely to affect companies like Amazon and Facebook. So far, 132 countries have signed up to the framework, being championed by The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The agreement is a further boost for the plan signed up to by leaders of the G7 major economies in Cornwall a month ago. The G20 finance ministers - who represent 19 countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies, as well as the European Union - announced their support following a two-day meeting in Venice, Italy. The UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the deal as ""historic"", adding it would ensure the ""global tax system is fit for purpose in a digital age"". French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said there would be ""no turning back"". ""We are putting an end to the race to the bottom and the digital giants will now pay their fair share of taxes,"" he added. ""It's a once-in-a-century tax revolution."" The policy - which will also make companies pay more in the countries where they do business - will now go to a meeting of G20 leaders in October for final consideration. Governments have long grappled with the challenge of taxing global companies operating across many countries. That challenge has grown with the boom in huge tech corporations like Amazon and Facebook. At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there. That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done. The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways. Firstly it aims to make companies pay more tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits. Secondly, a global minimum tax rate would help avoid countries undercutting each other with low tax rates. Not everyone is in favour, however. Ireland is among those countries which have yet to sign up.

"Projects providing family planning services will be among those to benefit from the temporary funding A group of philanthropists, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are to provide Â£93.5m emergency funding to cover some UK foreign aid cuts. They said the temporary funding would help save ""critical projects"" and ensure progress was not ""wasted"". The government has decided to reduce this year's spending on overseas aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. It said the financial impact of the pandemic had forced ministers to take ""tough but necessary decisions"". The group, which also includes the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, the ELMA Foundation and Open Society Foundations, said the emergency funds would help projects tackling preventable diseases and providing family planning and sexual health services. They said it would prevent life-saving drugs from being thrown away because they pass their expiry date, and ensure women living in the poorest parts of the world are able to avoid unplanned pregnancies. The UN's family planning agency (UNFPA)looks set to lose some 85% of its funding from the UK,a drop of about Â£130m. Foreign Office criticised over aid cuts handling Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Is public opinion shifting on cutting foreign aid? A spokeswoman for the funder consortium, Kate Hampton, chief executive of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, said: ""These life-saving treatments are cost-effective investments. If they go unfunded this year, British taxpayer generosity will be wasted as clinics are closed and essential drugs expire and are thrown away."" The emergency funding was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who said it was ""desperately needed"". However, he called on the government to restore its commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on foreign aid. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: ""When Britain withdraws, others step in. By cutting our aid, we have given states such as China and Russia an opportunity to expand their influence at Britain's expense."" Charities including Oxfam and ActionAid have criticised the cuts - which amount to around Â£4bn a year -warning that they have already forced projects to be cancelled. Many Tory MPs have also spoken out against the move, which went against the pledge in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto to stick to the 0.7% figure. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak has previously said it was hard to ""justify"" the commitment with the UK facing record borrowing,and with a national debt of well over Â£2 trillion. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK will spend more than Â£10bn to improve global health, fight poverty and tackle climate change this year - making us one of the biggest aid donors in the G7."" ""We have always been clear that the government will return to spending 0.7% of GNI [gross national income] on international development as soon as the fiscal situation allows,"" the spokesperson added.

"Flags are out all over Italy for today's Euro 2020 final ""Do the English really put pineapple on pizza?"" asks the Italian daily La Repubblica in a piece by its London correspondent. ""Rarely,"" it concludes, ""but the real problem is adding cream to spaghetti carbonara."" Sunday's Euro final is not just a clash of sport, but of cultures. ""The thing about us Italians is that we are a country of beauty,"" says the newspaper Corriere della Sera. ""We don't just score goals, we score beautiful goals."" It adds: ""There's no such thing as a badly-dressed Italian, just some Italians who aren't interested in dressing well."" But for all that divides these markedly different countries - few Italians rave about British cuisine, in case you were wondering - there are many similarities. Football runs through the veins of both nations. While England have been waiting for international football glory since 1966, Italy last won a European title in 1968 and are also impatient for triumph (though two World Cup wins since, in 1982 and 2006, have eased the pain). Watching Euros may be behind rise in Covid in men How late can pubs and bars open for England's Euro final? What all of us can learn from Gareth Southgate And both teams have been revolutionised by their managers, with Gareth Southgate and Roberto Mancini bringing in younger players and laying ghosts of the past to rest - England with its failure to reach an international final for decades and Italy with its non-qualification for the 2018 World Cup, labelled ""an apocalypse"" by the country's leading sports newspaper. ""Mancini is the central man of this Italian miracle,"" says Alvaro Moretti, the deputy editor of the daily Il Messaggero and its former sports editor. Alvaro Moretti says Roberto Mancini has rekindled the fortunes of the Italy team ""When he took over in 2018, he believed from the start that he would arrive at this point. He's very charismatic, he's very elegant. And he decided that his approach would be enjoyment, to bring happiness to the Italian team - and to the Italian people."" That is, perhaps, the overriding feeling in Italy as it watches gli Azzurri (the Blues) go into this final - joy. The first country in the West to be crushed by the Coronavirus pandemic, whose inundated intensive care units forewarned others of what was to come, has seen infection levels drop sharply so as to be able to lift most restrictions and for Italians to watch their team's triumphant performances in bars. ""I'm even happier about the rebirth of Italy than about the final itself,"" says Gianluca Santangeli, sitting in his newspaper kiosk in the Trastevere district of Rome. Gianluca Santangeli is celebrating the lifting of Covid restrictions ""That people can go out without masks and watch it on big screens is a relief."" As for his prediction? ""I believe in fate,"" he says. ""But I think Italy should play our classic tactics: strong defence and counter-attack, since we're facing a good England team at home."" The match has, of course, split loyalties among the many Anglo-Italian couples, including Elisa Sandri, who lives in Brighton with her British partner but is currently back in Rome. Enjoying a coffee with her old friend, Anna, she jokes that she's had the odd heated discussion over the match with English colleagues but with her partner, ""we've been watching the games together and cheering for each other, so I think it'll be fine"". ""In any case it'll be a win-win for me,"" she adds. ""I just love the atmosphere here when Italy plays. Everyone comes together, cheers and hugs, you make new friends. I think England might winâ¦but if it goes to penalties, they won't!"" Elisa Sandri (R) says Italians have come together during the Euro 2020 matches Shopping for tomatoes at a nearby market, Morosina Zorzi has other concerns. ""The main thing I'm worried about is that my son's wedding is happening at the same time as the match,"" she says. ""He doesn't want a big screen at the reception, so I think the guests will be watching it on their phones - and I'm sure some of them will leave to go and watch it."" She admits she's not a football fan but says: ""If Italy win I'll be happy because of the national spirit - though Rome will be a mess with all the partying."" This proud nation is sure of victory over England in most respects - beaches, food, fashion. But for football-mad Italians, a win tonight might just be the sweetest of all.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Barty beats Pliskova claims Wimbledon title Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Ashleigh Barty won her maiden Wimbledon title as she beat Karolina Pliskova in a nervy final to become the first Australian women's champion for 41 years. Barty won the first 14 points to take early charge in a 6-3 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 win on the 50th anniversary of idol Evonne Goolagong Cawley's maiden win here. ""This is incredible,"" said Barty, who dropped to her haunches in tears. ""It took me a long time to verbalise, to dare to dream it and say it."" After climbing up into the stands to hug her team, she told the Centre Court crowd: ""I didn't sleep a lot last night. I was thinking of all the what-ifs. I hope I made Evonne proud. ""I have to thank every single person in this stadium. You've made my dream so special."" Barty says it was 'miracle' she even played This video can not be played 'A destiny fulfilled' - watch the moment Barty wins Wimbledon Both women were making their debut in the final of the grass-court Grand Slam - the first time since 1977 that had happened - and that may go some way to explaining the rollercoaster nature of the match, which felt at times more like a battle of the minds. After Barty's flying start, Czech Pliskova settled in the second set, rediscovering her big serve before errors crept back in the third. Barty had the chance to serve out victory in the 12th game of the second set but she was broken as Pliskova forced a tie-break, which the Czech won when the Australian double-faulted. Barty took an early break in the third, which proved decisive as she added the Wimbledon trophy to the French Open title she won in 2019. Reaction to Barty's win over Pliskova in Wimbledon final - TV, radio & text Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone By winning Wimbledon, Ashleigh Barty has fulfilled her childhood dream Barty has been sporting a scallop-hem dress in tribute to Goolagong Cawley, her idol, friend and mentor. There have long been comparisons between the two, with Barty playing a similar all-court game, as well as sharing a similar modest and popular personality and indigenous Australian heritage. They now also have their names on the Venus Rosewater Dish. Barty, who won the junior Wimbledon title in 2011, has become the fourth woman in the Open era to go on to also lift the women's title after Britain's Ann Jones, Swiss Martina Hingis and France's Amelie Mauresmo. She made a fast start to go 4-0 up as Pliskova seemed constrained by the weight of the occasion but the Czech finally got on the scoreboard with a break to love. But it was too late as Barty wrapped up the set in just 28 minutes. More nerves from the Czech in the shape of back-to-back double faults handed Barty a break for 2-1 at the start of the second set but Pliskova fought back to level the set. Barty came from 40-0 down to break for 6-5 but nerves then seemed to creep into her own game as she failed to serve out the victory and instead found herself in a tie-break. Pliskova took the match to a third set but then double-faulted and netted a volley to give Barty a key break before the Australian held her nerve this time to serve out the win. A big server, Pliskova's game is well suited to grass and she has enjoyed success on the surface with two Eastbourne titles. The former world number one's progress to the final had been somewhat under the radar because of poor run in the build-up coupled with a reputation as a serial underperformer on the biggest stages. Her only previous Grand Slam final was the 2016 US Open, and since then she had reached only two more major semi-finals before this year's Wimbledon. While reaching the final was marked progress on that score, her tightness at times was not - especially during what she branded a ""horrible start"". Coming into the match she had hit a tournament-leading 54 aces but in the first set here she managed none at all. She fired five aces in the second as that part of her game began to improve but her nerves were still visible at the changeovers when she repeatedly jigged her legs up and down. Her emotions spilled over during her on-court interview as her voice broke, saying: ""I never cry, never, and now..."" She later added: ""It was not the plan to cry because I don't want to cry on the court. I feel like, OK, cry in the locker room, but not on the court. Somehow I could not."" She vowed to come back stronger, saying: ""Of course there's going to be next chances. I think plenty of them. I'm not going to give up on that. ""In the end the result is we both tried to win so somebody has to lose. You have to accept that. I will definitely. ""I know how to lose, believe me. I'm so good in that."" Pat Cash, former Wimbledon champion on BBC Radio 5 Live:""What a special moment. This is the moment that makes it all worthwhile, it really is."" Tracy Austin, two-time Grand Slam champion on BBC TV:""To win on the 50th anniversary of her idol, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who she admires so much. This is so special to share this moment with her team. ""She put it out there just a few months ago that she wanted to win Wimbledon."" Annabel Croft, former British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live:""She was a little undercooked and it did take her those early rounds to get her game going again, but my goodness at the end it was sensational. ""When you've watched someone go through so much in their tennis life, then needed to get away from it [Barty took a break from tennis in 2014 before playing cricket for 18 months], and then to come back and win Wimbledon - it is the stuff of dreams, almost the stuff of movies.""

"Ministers are considering exempting fully vaccinated NHS staff in England from having to self-isolate if they are traced as a Covid contact. Health bosses have been urging the government to change the rules amid fears of staff shortages. Sources said no decision had been taken and ministers wanted to see evidence the move would be safe. If it goes ahead, self-isolation would be replaced with daily tests from 19 July, when wider curbs are eased. The idea echoes a similar policy that would apply toall fully vaccinated people and children in England from 16 August. It comes as medical leaders warn the Covid situation in the UK will get worse before it gets betterwith the NHS ""under unprecedented pressure"". How many people are deleting the Covid app? Should I still wear a mask after 19 July? I'm fully jabbed, so do I need to self-isolate? Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers which represents health trusts, said double-jabbed health service staff ""should be able to carry on working even if they are pinged"" by the NHS Covid-19 app. She said: ""The government should bring that in as soon as possible. I can't see any reason to delay. NHS trusts are struggling with the number of staff having to isolate - anecdotally we're seeing significant numbers off [work]."" ""We've picked up on the fact some staff are deleting the app, but it's not happening on a big, widespread scale at this point."" Health and social care workers were among the first people in the UK to be eligible for a coronavirus vaccine when it became available in December 2020. Of the estimated 1.3m NHS trust health care workers in England, around 1.1m have received two vaccine doses,according to data,externalfrom NHS England. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was delighted the evidence for changing the policy for fully vaccinated health workers was being reviewed, adding that it ""sounds like a sensible next step"". And Dr David Wrigley, from the British Medical Association, said NHS staff who have had both jabs ""should be able to work if it is deemed safe so to do"" - as long as they have the appropriate personal protective equipment and their workplace ""adheres to the most stringent of infection controls"". Latest figures showed the number of isolation alerts from the app increased by more than 60% compared with the previous week. More than 360,000 alerts were sent in England and Wales between 24 June and 30 June, as infections rose across the UK. Asked if NHS staff could be exempted from isolation orders, a No 10 spokesman told the Financial Times,which first reported the story,external, it was ""something we're looking at ahead of step four"" of England's roadmap out of lockdown. One official told the newspaper it was increasingly recognised that a ""pragmatic"" solution was needed to protect the health service. It followed confirmation that the NHS Covid-19 app's developers are now changing its settings so that it becomes less sensitive, after concerns that people were being alerted to self-isolate after only fleeting contact with a positive case. At the moment, devices at a distance of 2m or less, for a minimum of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are registered as a close contact. A source close to the developers said this measure would change and that ""things are moving fast"",the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones reported. Businesses and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge, if current rules did not adapt. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidan estimated 400,000 people in the UKare thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July. On Saturday, the UK recorded 32,367 new cases and 34 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It is the fourth day in a row case numbers have been above 30,000, while Friday saw the highest daily figure since 22 January. Around two-thirds of adults have now been double jabbed against the virus, and experts say this is helping prevent very big rises in Covid hospitalisations, although admissions are increasing.

"This video can not be played Euro 2016: England 1-2 Iceland - Roy Hodgson resigns after defeat England v Italy in Euro 2020 final Date:Sunday, 11 JulyTime:20:00 BSTVenue:Wembley Stadium, LondonCoverage:Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio 5 Live, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app Roy Hodgson sat behind a desk in Chantilly uttering the words that would become his epitaph as England manager: ""I don't really know what I'm doing here."" Hodgson meant he did not understand why he was being forced to attend a press conference the day after he had resigned following the humiliating defeat by Iceland in the last 16 of Euro 2016 in France. However, it was a comment that worked on many levels. It perhaps reflected the scrambled state of mind of a decent man and manager who had presided over possibly England's worst ever performance. This is what England do to you. They offer hope, despair, optimism, pessimism, elation, misery. Quite often in the space of the same 90 minutes. Five years on from the embarrassment of Nice, England have the chance to experience their biggest high since the 1966 World Cup win when they face Italy in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley Stadium. This is the moment many England fans, and those of us who track these events at close quarters, thought we would never see. Is this landmark day going to be glorious payback for the years of falling short? A nation turns its eyes to Gareth Southgate and England. Observing England may be many things but it is never dull, especially for those of us who have travelled this particular road in one form or another for 25 years. This video can not be played Euro 2020: Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, Harry Maguire & Jordan Henderson - watch every England Euro 2020 goal so far It was an ominous sign that the first England game I covered, in a previous journalistic life, was the agonising loss on penalties to Germany in the Euro 96 semi-final. It was perfect preparation for events to come. I have covered England for the BBC at every major tournament since 2002 and, as would become a regular occurrence, there was plenty of optimism on the flight to Osaka's Kansai Airport. And, apart from at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and this glorious delayed Euro 2020, it was misplaced. The Japanese city of Sapporo provided the high point of England's 2002 World Cup campaign, hosting a victory for Sven-Goran Eriksson's side against Argentina under the Superdome, all played out amid lingering resentment from the South Americans' acrimonious victory over England on penalties at France 1998. The morning after the night before, one unwitting England reporter making his exit mistakenly jumped on to the waiting Argentina team bus. No names - let us say for the sake of this story that it was the Press Association's legendary England scribe John Curtis - but he greeted a still boiling mad Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta with the unwise words: ""Sorry Gabriel mate. England media bus. You need to get off and get on your own bus."" Cue this poor unfortunate being manhandled off the coach and bundled into the hotel foyer, closely followed by his luggage, to the strains of a Mexican mariachi band entertaining the guests. But the laughs did not last long. Elimination came with a quarter-final loss to eventual champions Brazil, the sight of a slowly backpedalling David Seaman still clear in the mind's eye as Ronaldinho's free-kick looped over him. The veteran was later ushered past the waiting media in tears, accompanied by a Football Association representative. Qualification has always been relatively straightforward and competitions difficult but Euro 2004 must always be regarded as the one that got away under Eriksson's laid-back, star struck regime. A superb England team was bolstered by the emergence of Everton's explosive teenage superstar Wayne Rooney as the tournament was engulfed by ""Roo-mania"". The phenomenon captured global attention, calls being taken from all parts of the world seeking the flimsiest piece of unknown information about the England striker. Those of us who attended the same school as him, much earlier obviously, basked in this reflected glory when asked to tell his story. As ever, England were a huge story. As ever, it ended in bitter disappointment, a loss on penalties to Portugal in the quarter-finals in Lisbon's iconic Stadium of Light. Rooney left that game early with a broken foot as England's hopes were sabotaged by his injury and a Sol Campbell goal controversially disallowed. Greece won Euro 2004. The rest of us wondered how England had not. The list of near-misses and misfortune seemed endless until the hope of these past four weeks. Eriksson's reign ended two years later in the circus of Baden-Baden at the 2006 Germany World Cup, with that beautiful town overtaken by WAGs and the attendant paparazzi, turning England's actual football into a sideshow. Ashley Cole's then wife Cheryl and David Beckham's wife Victoria were the centre of attention and a small bar named Garibaldi's became WAG HQ, the owner's ship sailing lucratively into town on a nightly basis. England's performance at the tournament probably needed overshadowing, again eliminated by Portugal on penalties at the quarter-final stage, this time hampered by a red card for Rooney, sent off for lashing out at Ricardo Carvalho. This video can not be played 50 Great World Cup moments: Wayne Rooney sent off against Portugal - 2006 Fabio Capello followed as England manager and was supposed to bring a winning mentality and a stern authority. One out of two was not enough. Instead, the South Africa World Cup in 2010 produced an England campaign of unrelenting misery, turgid football and eventually a complete and utter pasting. As low points go, it takes some beating but England have certainly tried until Southgate's superb renaissance. Capello appeared to lose the plot completely on the eve of the tournament with the advent of a commercial enterprise called The Capello Index, which rated the performances of players. Not ideal when it involved his own. As we trooped into the lavish surroundings of so-called 'Camp Capello' at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Campus outside Rustenburg, even the most casual observer could detect a truly rotten atmosphere. One player said: ""When we open our windows, we could be anywhere. You wouldn't know you were even in South Africa in this place."" Capello turned on the media, ranting at a photographer he wrongly assumed was taking pictures of the treatment room. England's grim performance in a 3-0 warm-up win over local team Platinum Stars had the optimists among us confident they were not as shoddy as they looked, and they were simply keeping their powder dry. How wrong we were. Amid stiff competition, the goalless draw with Algeria in Cape Town is the worst international game I have ever covered. The game when literally nothing happened. At least not until a frustrated Rooney turned his frustration on a TV camera and attacked England's critical fans, a blessing in disguise for those of us needing something spicy to say. 'Nice to see your own fans booing you' The team and fans had become detached, a world away from what we have seen at Euro 2020. Not even the controversy surrounding Frank Lampard's shot - not given as a goal despite bouncing over the line - could rescue any consolation from a 4-1 loss to Germany in the last 16. Euro 2012 was almost a free hit for the recently appointed Hodgson, in after Capello's resignation, but old habits die hard and once again it ended with defeat, this time against Italy on penalties in the quarter-final. It almost ended in arrest and a period of incarceration for this reporter after a foolish attempt to defend comedian Bernie Clifton in a discussion with a large-hatted Kyiv policeman trying to move on England's brass band. Having been wrongly identified as the band's manager by a ""mischievous"" colleague, the explanation that Clifton was an English national treasure famous for running around with an ostrich between his legs cut no ice, unsurprisingly, with the forces of the law. That episode raises a smile now, but looking back at Hodgson's reign does not. He had been England manager for two years when the World Cup landed in the location of the sport's romantic dreams, Brazil, with the final at the iconic Maracana Stadium. England's preparations in Miami lasted longer than their actual involvement in the tournament, out after successive defeats against Italy and Uruguay. We learned their fate as phones started pinging on touchdown back in Rio after Costa Rica had beaten Italy. In a reflection of the time, expectations were so low that England were actually applauded off by their fans after a dismal goalless dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte completed the campaign. Throw in another shambles at Euro 2016 and this is what makes the renaissance under Southgate and a group of players the nation has come to love so satisfying. This video can not be played Harry Kane's winner sends England to Euro 2020 final Bonds that never existed before, especially in the era of the so-called 'Golden Generation', have been forged here. Being around England has become a more relaxed experience - and what a joy it is to see them winning regularly, when the pressure is really on. It has been a long time since Japan in 2002, many thousands of miles, occasional joy, much misery and tales to tell - but the Euro 2020 final now offers up the prospect of the happy, glorious ending so many following this story thought would always remain elusive. 30 Animals That Made Us Smarter:The robotic arm that was inspired by elephants Is there such thing as a perfect penalty?Can science help footballers shoot the perfect shot?

"Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith addressed the crowd, calling for ""urgent action"" Plans to tackle the second homes ""crisis"" in Wales are ""vague"" and ""unambitious"", a campaign group says. Hundreds gathered at Llyn Celyn in Gwynedd on Saturday after the Welsh government announced plans to""inject fairness back into the housing system"". Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes at 5,098, which represents 20% of all second homes in Wales. The Welsh government said it was ""working at speed"" for ""sustainable solutions to what are complex issues"". Mabli Siriol, chairwoman of Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith, addressed the crowd and called for ""urgent action"". Housing market: Are second home owners really pricing locals out? Second homes in Wales: Pilot scheme planned to tackle 'crisis' Second home premium tax legal action dropped over risks She called for measures including new taxes and legislation to bring in price caps on second homes, and ""invest that money in our communities to bring houses back into public hands"". ""What we've got from them is vague and unambitious promises - more consultation, more pilot projects - that will take years to make a difference, which is time we can't afford to waste,"" she said. One placard read ""hawl i fyw yn lleol"" (right to live locally) There were 24,873 second homes registered for council tax purposes in Wales in January 2021, according to official figures. Officials say numbers of homes could be much higher depending on the exact definition of a second home. Those looking to buy second homes or buy-to-let properties in Wales have to pay an extra 4% in land transaction tax (LTT) on top of the tax payable for their band. Gwynedd has 5,098 second homes - 20% of all second homes in Wales New figures from the Welsh Revenue Authority show 44% of all homes sold in the Gwynedd constituency of Dwyfor Meirionnydd during 2020-21 were subject to the higher rate of LTT. The area's member of the Senedd (MS), Mabon ap Gwynfor, told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service: ""These latest statistics show that the housing crisis is getting worse and that the Welsh government's decision to raise the LTT by 1% hasn't worked... we have to take much more ambitious steps."" Earlier this week the Welsh government said it would pick an area of Wales topilot new policiesaimed at ""injecting fairness back into the housing system"". It said officials would also look at options to shut a tax ""loophole"" where some second home owners do not pay council tax. The government has also said it will launch a Welsh Language Communities Housing Plan in the autumn. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""Fairness is at the heart of our plans, ensuring that everyone in Wales can have access to good quality, affordable housing. ""Within the first two months of forming a new government, we have set out plans to begin to address the impact of second and holiday home ownership in some communities and to protect the interests of Welsh language communities.

"G20 finance ministers have backed an ""historic"" plan which will see multinational companies pay their ""fair share"" of tax around the world. The plan to battle tax avoidance puts in place a minimum global corporate tax rate of 15%. It is likely to affect companies like Amazon and Facebook. So far, 132 countries have signed up to the framework, being championed by The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The agreement is a further boost for the plan signed up to by leaders of the G7 major economies in Cornwall a month ago. The G20 finance ministers - who represent 19 countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies, as well as the European Union - announced their support following a two-day meeting in Venice, Italy. The UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the deal as ""historic"", adding it would ensure the ""global tax system is fit for purpose in a digital age"". French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said there would be ""no turning back"". ""We are putting an end to the race to the bottom and the digital giants will now pay their fair share of taxes,"" he added. ""It's a once-in-a-century tax revolution."" The policy - which will also make companies pay more in the countries where they do business - will now go to a meeting of G20 leaders in October for final consideration. Governments have long grappled with the challenge of taxing global companies operating across many countries. That challenge has grown with the boom in huge tech corporations like Amazon and Facebook. At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there. That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done. The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways. Firstly it aims to make companies pay more tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits. Secondly, a global minimum tax rate would help avoid countries undercutting each other with low tax rates. Not everyone is in favour, however. Ireland is among those countries which have yet to sign up.

"This video can not be played Extreme heat builds again in North America Extreme heat is building in the western United States, with forecasts of record-breaking temperatures in the states of California and Nevada. It comes just weeks after another dangerous heatwave hit North America, and the region has experienced the hottest June on record. California's Death Valley on Friday recorded a high of 54.4C (130F), with similar heat expected this weekend. Millions of people in the US are under warnings of excessive heat. The National Weather Service has advised those affected to drink plenty of water and stay in air conditioned buildings. The temperature in Death Valley on Friday matched one recorded in August 2020 - which some argue is the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth. A temperature of 56.7C (134F) was recorded in 1913, but this is contested by climate experts. Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes A really simple guide to climate change Firefighters battling the many wildfires in the region say the air is so dry that much of the water dropped by aircraft to quell the flames evaporates before it reaches the ground. In the north of Nevada, near the border with California, people were evacuated from their homes as wildfires triggered by lightning strikes tore through parts of the Sierra Nevada forest region. Forecasters say Las Vegas's record of 47.2C (117F) could also be passed. In Oregon, more evacuation orders were issued when a wildfire fanned by strong winds in the Fremont-Winema National Forest grew from nearly 26 sq miles (67 sq km) on Thursday to nearly 61 sq miles on Friday. The heatwave has left huge areas of California bone-dry and prone to wildfires A cooling centre was set up at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland to help people affected by the heatwave The fire was threatening power cables that send electricity to California. Power grid operators in California have urged customers to conserve electricity by reducing their use of appliances and to keep thermostats higher during the evening when solar energy is diminished or no longer available. In Idaho, Governor Brad Little declared a wildfire emergency and mobilised the state's National Guard to help fight fires also sparked by lightning. Canada is also bracing for extreme heat, though it is not expected to approach the temperatures seen at the end of last month when the village Lytton in British Columbia reached 49.6C (121F), breaking the country's highest recorded temperature. The heatwave saw spikes in sudden deaths and increases in hospital visits for heat-related illnesses. Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. But linking any single event to global warming is complicated. A study by climate researchers said the heat that scorched western Canada and the US at the end of Junewas ""virtually impossible"" without climate change.

"Ministers are considering exempting fully vaccinated NHS staff in England from having to self-isolate if they are traced as a Covid contact. Health bosses have been urging the government to change the rules amid fears of staff shortages. Sources said no decision had been taken and ministers wanted to see evidence the move would be safe. If it goes ahead, self-isolation would be replaced with daily tests from 19 July, when wider curbs are eased. The idea echoes a similar policy that would apply toall fully vaccinated people and children in England from 16 August. It comes as medical leaders warn the Covid situation in the UK will get worse before it gets betterwith the NHS ""under unprecedented pressure"". How many people are deleting the Covid app? Should I still wear a mask after 19 July? I'm fully jabbed, so do I need to self-isolate? Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers which represents health trusts, said double-jabbed health service staff ""should be able to carry on working even if they are pinged"" by the NHS Covid-19 app. She said: ""The government should bring that in as soon as possible. I can't see any reason to delay. NHS trusts are struggling with the number of staff having to isolate - anecdotally we're seeing significant numbers off [work]."" ""We've picked up on the fact some staff are deleting the app, but it's not happening on a big, widespread scale at this point."" Health and social care workers were among the first people in the UK to be eligible for a coronavirus vaccine when it became available in December 2020. Of the estimated 1.3m NHS trust health care workers in England, around 1.1m have received two vaccine doses,according to data,externalfrom NHS England. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was delighted the evidence for changing the policy for fully vaccinated health workers was being reviewed, adding that it ""sounds like a sensible next step"". And Dr David Wrigley, from the British Medical Association, said NHS staff who have had both jabs ""should be able to work if it is deemed safe so to do"" - as long as they have the appropriate personal protective equipment and their workplace ""adheres to the most stringent of infection controls"". Latest figures showed the number of isolation alerts from the app increased by more than 60% compared with the previous week. More than 360,000 alerts were sent in England and Wales between 24 June and 30 June, as infections rose across the UK. Asked if NHS staff could be exempted from isolation orders, a No 10 spokesman told the Financial Times,which first reported the story,external, it was ""something we're looking at ahead of step four"" of England's roadmap out of lockdown. One official told the newspaper it was increasingly recognised that a ""pragmatic"" solution was needed to protect the health service. It followed confirmation that the NHS Covid-19 app's developers are now changing its settings so that it becomes less sensitive, after concerns that people were being alerted to self-isolate after only fleeting contact with a positive case. At the moment, devices at a distance of 2m or less, for a minimum of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are registered as a close contact. A source close to the developers said this measure would change and that ""things are moving fast"",the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones reported. Businesses and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge, if current rules did not adapt. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) saidan estimated 400,000 people in the UKare thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July. On Saturday, the UK recorded 32,367 new cases and 34 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It is the fourth day in a row case numbers have been above 30,000, while Friday saw the highest daily figure since 22 January. Around two-thirds of adults have now been double jabbed against the virus, and experts say this is helping prevent very big rises in Covid hospitalisations, although admissions are increasing.

"Fans have already started gathering outside Wembley for Sunday evening's final The Queen and Boris Johnson have led messages of support to the England team ahead of the Euro 2020 final. The monarch recalled presenting the World Cup trophy to Bobby Moore in 1966 as she praised the current team's ""spirit, commitment and pride with which you have conducted yourselves"". And in a letter to the squad, the prime minister said they had ""lifted the spirits of the whole country"". The Duke of Cambridge said he ""can't really believe this is happening"". Prince William, who is president of the English Football Association (FA), urged the squad to ""bring it home"" and said the team had already displayed ""the very best of England"". Gareth Southgate's team play Italy at Wembley on Sunday at 20:00 BST. What ARE they talking about? England fan-speak explained What's it like to have Gareth Southgate as your manager? Your stories of watching England 'A moment we feared would never happen' FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the mood in the England camp was ""very calm"". He said Southgate had built a really strong environment and created a ""band of brothers feeling"" in the team, which had a ""fantastic togetherness"" and ""resilience"". ""We're in a good place. It will be a tough game but we're going to give it a good go,"" he added. Asked what he would say to England fans considering booing the Italian national anthem before the match, he said: ""We've been really clear we do not support that. We want them to really get behind the teamâ¦ but get behind the team in the right way."" The Queen presents Bobby Moore with the Jules Rimet Trophy for winning the World Cup in 1966 The Queen's message hailed the ""spirit, commitment and pride"" of the England players. She wrote: ""Fifty-five years ago I was fortunate to present the World Cup to Bobby Moore and saw what it meant to the players, management and support staff to reach and win the final of a major international football tournament. ""I want to send my congratulations and that of my family to you all on reaching the final of the European Championships, and send my good wishes for tomorrow with the hope that history will record not only your success but also the spirit, commitment and pride with which you have conducted yourselves.""

Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the team as ""role models"" as he urged them to ""bring it home"". ""On and off the field, you've shown the best of England during this tournament,"" he said. ""You've been as fearless as the three lions on our crest. You've lit up this tournament. And in spite of those who tried to undermine you, you've used your platform to stand up for our shared values as a country."" No 10 Downing Street was decked out in St George's flags ahead of the game Speaking at a news conference on Saturday evening, Southgate said: ""It has been fantastic to have the letter from the Queen and the prime minister to all of the team - and the recognition the players have gone about this in the right way. ""But we're in a final and we're here to win. Now we want to go and bring the trophy home.""

Captain Harry Kane said: ""To see the fans on the street and see the reception we have had, it has just shown us how big of an occasion it is.

"An Afghan man suspected of being a leading member of an international people-smuggling network has been arrested in north London. Gul Wali Jabarkhel, 32, was detained by National Crime Agency (NCA) officers in Colindale on Thursday evening. He is accused of being part of an organised crime group involved in transporting migrants from northern France and Belgium into the UK. He faces two charges of conspiracy to facilitate illegal migration to the UK. Mr Jabarkhel appeared at Willesden Magistrates' Court on Saturday. He was remanded in custody and will appear at Harrow Crown Court on 6 August. The Afghan group he is suspected of being involved with allegedly had contacts with organised gangs in Belgium, and planned to use lorry drivers to smuggle migrants across the Channel on a regular basis, the NCA said. NCA Branch Commander Andy Noyes said: ""This is a significant arrest. Jabarkhel is suspected of running a criminal enterprise which involved migrants being moved across the Channel in lorries in dangerous circumstances. ""Organised immigration crime sees people treated as a commodity to be exploited and profited from, and tackling it is a priority for the NCA.""

"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious.

WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive.

"This video can not be played The statue of General Robert E Lee was towed away from Market Street Park, Charlottesville A statue of an American Confederate general at the centre of a violent rally in Charlottesville nearly four years ago has been taken down. Onlookers cheered as the statue of General Robert E Lee was put onto a truck and driven away for storage. Plans to remove the statue prompted a white nationalist rally in August 2017. An anti-racism protester, Heather Heyer, was murderedby a neo-Nazi who drove into her at a counter-protest. Her killer was later sentenced to life in prison. Another statue of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson has also been removed. Memorials to the pro-slavery Confederacy - the southern states which revolted against the federal government during the US Civil War - have long stirred controversy. Hundreds of statues of Lee, Jackson and other famous Confederate figures exist throughout the US. Some see them as markers of US history and southern culture. But to others, they serve as an offensive reminder of America's history of slavery and racial oppression. The ""Unite the Right"" march held in Charlottesville, Virginia, was one of the largest such gatherings in decades, and drew hundreds of neo-Nazis, white nationalist and Ku Klux Klan members. Dozens were injured in the violence that erupted between the marchers and counter-protesters. What happened in Charlottesville? Why the fuss over Confederate statues? The events stunned the US and tensions were further inflamed by formerPresident Donald Trump's insistence that there was ""blame on both sides"". Charlottesville had continued to push for the removal of the Lee statue after the protests, but was prevented from acting by legal action and changes to the law. Then in April, Virginia's highest court ruled the statue could be taken down. This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville Charlottesville had welcomed viewers to watch the statues come down early on Saturday morning. As a crane neared the monument, Charlottesville's mayor Nikuyah Walker said its removal was an important signal to the whole country. ""Taking down this statue is one small step closer to the goal of helping Charlottesville, Virginia and America grapple with its sin of being willing to destroy black people for economic gains,"" she said. Take 'Em Down CVille, a group which has campaigned for the statues' removal, applauded news of the removal. ""No one believes that removing the statues will end white supremacy but this is an important step - and one long past due,"" it said. City officials say the statues will be held in a secure location until the council decides where to relocate them. Local officials have said they plan to redesign the park spaces where the statues are located ""in a way that promotes healing and that tells a more complete history of Charlottesville"".

"This video can not be played Highlights: Barty beats Pliskova claims Wimbledon title Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Ashleigh Barty won her maiden Wimbledon title as she beat Karolina Pliskova in a nervy final to become the first Australian women's champion for 41 years. Barty won the first 14 points to take early charge in a 6-3 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 win on the 50th anniversary of idol Evonne Goolagong Cawley's maiden win here. ""This is incredible,"" said Barty, who dropped to her haunches in tears. ""It took me a long time to verbalise, to dare to dream it and say it."" After climbing up into the stands to hug her team, she told the Centre Court crowd: ""I didn't sleep a lot last night. I was thinking of all the what-ifs. I hope I made Evonne proud. ""I have to thank every single person in this stadium. You've made my dream so special."" Barty says it was 'miracle' she even played This video can not be played 'A destiny fulfilled' - watch the moment Barty wins Wimbledon Both women were making their debut in the final of the grass-court Grand Slam - the first time since 1977 that had happened - and that may go some way to explaining the rollercoaster nature of the match, which felt at times more like a battle of the minds. After Barty's flying start, Czech Pliskova settled in the second set, rediscovering her big serve before errors crept back in the third. Barty had the chance to serve out victory in the 12th game of the second set but she was broken as Pliskova forced a tie-break, which the Czech won when the Australian double-faulted. Barty took an early break in the third, which proved decisive as she added the Wimbledon trophy to the French Open title she won in 2019. Reaction to Barty's win over Pliskova in Wimbledon final - TV, radio & text Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone By winning Wimbledon, Ashleigh Barty has fulfilled her childhood dream Barty has been sporting a scallop-hem dress in tribute to Goolagong Cawley, her idol, friend and mentor. There have long been comparisons between the two, with Barty playing a similar all-court game, as well as sharing a similar modest and popular personality and indigenous Australian heritage. They now also have their names on the Venus Rosewater Dish. Barty, who won the junior Wimbledon title in 2011, has become the fourth woman in the Open era to go on to also lift the women's title after Britain's Ann Jones, Swiss Martina Hingis and France's Amelie Mauresmo. She made a fast start to go 4-0 up as Pliskova seemed constrained by the weight of the occasion but the Czech finally got on the scoreboard with a break to love. But it was too late as Barty wrapped up the set in just 28 minutes. More nerves from the Czech in the shape of back-to-back double faults handed Barty a break for 2-1 at the start of the second set but Pliskova fought back to level the set. Barty came from 40-0 down to break for 6-5 but nerves then seemed to creep into her own game as she failed to serve out the victory and instead found herself in a tie-break. Pliskova took the match to a third set but then double-faulted and netted a volley to give Barty a key break before the Australian held her nerve this time to serve out the win. A big server, Pliskova's game is well suited to grass and she has enjoyed success on the surface with two Eastbourne titles. The former world number one's progress to the final had been somewhat under the radar because of poor run in the build-up coupled with a reputation as a serial underperformer on the biggest stages. Her only previous Grand Slam final was the 2016 US Open, and since then she had reached only two more major semi-finals before this year's Wimbledon. While reaching the final was marked progress on that score, her tightness at times was not - especially during what she branded a ""horrible start"". Coming into the match she had hit a tournament-leading 54 aces but in the first set here she managed none at all. She fired five aces in the second as that part of her game began to improve but her nerves were still visible at the changeovers when she repeatedly jigged her legs up and down. Her emotions spilled over during her on-court interview as her voice broke, saying: ""I never cry, never, and now..."" She later added: ""It was not the plan to cry because I don't want to cry on the court. I feel like, OK, cry in the locker room, but not on the court. Somehow I could not."" She vowed to come back stronger, saying: ""Of course there's going to be next chances. I think plenty of them. I'm not going to give up on that. ""In the end the result is we both tried to win so somebody has to lose. You have to accept that. I will definitely. ""I know how to lose, believe me. I'm so good in that."" Pat Cash, former Wimbledon champion on BBC Radio 5 Live:""What a special moment. This is the moment that makes it all worthwhile, it really is."" Tracy Austin, two-time Grand Slam champion on BBC TV:""To win on the 50th anniversary of her idol, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who she admires so much. This is so special to share this moment with her team. ""She put it out there just a few months ago that she wanted to win Wimbledon."" Annabel Croft, former British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live:""She was a little undercooked and it did take her those early rounds to get her game going again, but my goodness at the end it was sensational. ""When you've watched someone go through so much in their tennis life, then needed to get away from it [Barty took a break from tennis in 2014 before playing cricket for 18 months], and then to come back and win Wimbledon - it is the stuff of dreams, almost the stuff of movies.""

An anti-racism protester, Heather Heyer, was murderedby a neo-Nazi who drove into her at a counter-protest. Her killer was later sentenced to life in prison. Another statue of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson has also been removed. Memorials to the pro-slavery Confederacy - the southern states which revolted against the federal government during the US Civil War - have long stirred controversy. Hundreds of statues of Lee, Jackson and other famous Confederate figures exist throughout the US. Some see them as markers of US history and southern culture. But to others, they serve as an offensive reminder of America's history of slavery and racial oppression. The ""Unite the Right"" march held in Charlottesville, Virginia, was one of the largest such gatherings in decades, and drew hundreds of neo-Nazis, white nationalist and Ku Klux Klan members. Dozens were injured in the violence that erupted between the marchers and counter-protesters. What happened in Charlottesville? Why the fuss over Confederate statues? The events stunned the US and tensions were further inflamed by formerPresident Donald Trump's insistence that there was ""blame on both sides"". Charlottesville had continued to push for the removal of the Lee statue after the protests, but was prevented from acting by legal action and changes to the law. Then in April, Virginia's highest court ruled the statue could be taken down. This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville Charlottesville had welcomed viewers to watch the statues come down early on Saturday morning. As a crane neared the monument, Charlottesville's mayor Nikuyah Walker said its removal was an important signal to the whole country. ""Taking down this statue is one small step closer to the goal of helping Charlottesville, Virginia and America grapple with its sin of being willing to destroy black people for economic gains,"" she said. Take 'Em Down CVille, a group which has campaigned for the statues' removal, applauded news of the removal. ""No one believes that removing the statues will end white supremacy but this is an important step - and one long past due,"" it said. City officials say the statues will be held in a secure location until the council decides where to relocate them. Local officials have said they plan to redesign the park spaces where the statues are located ""in a way that promotes healing and that tells a more complete history of Charlottesville"".

"Paul Mariner scored 13 goals in 35 appearances for England Former England striker Paul Mariner, who won the FA Cup and Uefa Cup with Ipswich Town, has died aged 68. Mariner began his league career at Plymouth Argyle and also played for Arsenal and Portsmouth. He made 35 appearances for England, scoring 13 goals. ""We regretfully inform you that Paul passed away peacefully on 9 July surrounded by his family, after a brief battle with brain cancer,"" said a statement from Mariner's family. ""We would like to thank all the people who came to see him through his illness for their support and the messages that were sent to him; they meant a great deal to him and us. ""A special thank you must go to the NHS and the unbelievable care that he received when he most needed it and for that we, as a family, will be forever in your debt. ""Paul lived a full life and was fortunate enough to represent a group of fantastic football clubs as well as his country, all of which meant the world to him. ""Anyone who knew Paul will attest to his fantastic sense of humour, his passion for life and his work. He will be sorely missed by everyone who was ever around him and by those most close to him."" Lancashire-born Mariner made 155 appearances and scored 61 goals for Plymouth, who signed him from non-league Chorley in 1973. He moved to Ipswich in 1976 and was part of the side who won the FA Cup in 1978 and Uefa Cup in 1981 under manager Sir Bobby Robson. Mariner scored 135 goals in 339 appearances for the Portman Road side before joining Arsenal in 1984. He joined Portsmouth two years later and finished his playing career in the United States. He made his England debut in 1977 and played for his country at the 1982 World Cup. Mariner also had spells as manager of Plymouth and Major League Soccer side Toronto FC. ""The Argyle family is devastated to learn of the passing of legendary former striker and manager, Paul Mariner,"" said the Pilgrims. Ipswich inducted ""true great"" Mariner into the club's hall of fame in 2011. ""It's incredibly sad news and the thoughts of everyone at the club are with Paul's family and friends at this very difficult time,"" said Ipswich chief executive Mark Ashton. BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Paul Mariner was a striker of the highest class who mixed the old-fashioned virtues of physical presence and aerial power alongside a complete all-round game. He will be remembered as one of Sir Bobby Robson's most astute acquisitions when he moved to Ipswich Town from Plymouth Argyle in 1976, going on to become a key figure in their greatest period. Mariner played in the FA Cup final win against Arsenal in 1978 and also when Ipswich Town won the Uefa Cup in 1981, scoring in the first leg of a 5-4 aggregate win over AZ Alkmaar. It was a regret that Ipswich Town did not win the title despite coming close during his time at the club but Mariner's consistency, goals, character and outgoing personality made him one of their true legends of a golden era in Suffolk under Robson. Mariner's quality earned him England honours, the high point of his international career coming when he scored in the 3-1 win over France at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. He mixed modern attributes, was brave as well as skilful and at his peak was one of the finest British centre-forwards of his time. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Haiti parades suspects after president's murder Haiti has asked for foreign troops to be sent to the country to protect key infrastructure after the assassination of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se. The request was sent by the government to the US and the UN, but the US says it has no plans to offer military assistance ""at this time"". Haitian police earlier said a group of 28 foreign mercenaries killed the president on Wednesday. After a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 of them were detained. Some of the group, which Haiti says included retired Colombian soldiers, were held at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound, the police said. Three suspects were killed by police, and eight others are still being sought. The UN Security Council would have to approve any plan to send international troops to Haiti under UN auspices. Although the US will not offer troops, it said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti to help in the investigation. The killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country and it is unclear who is in effective charge of the country's government. Bloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons. It is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive. A number of questions remain unanswered, including how the alleged assassins were able to enter MoÃ¯se's home. His bodyguards are due to be questioned next week. One prominent opposition figure has openly expressed scepticism over the current version of events. Former Haitian senator Steven Benoit told local station Magik9 radio on Friday it was ""not Colombians who killed him"", but did not provide evidence to back up his claims. The attack took place in the early hours on 7 July, when gunmen entered the property, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr MoÃ¯se, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to the authorities. Martine MoÃ¯se, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment. What we know about the killing so far Police said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans. Found in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported. Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound. Angry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence. Axes, wire-cutters, sets of US dollar bills and Colombian passports have been seized Police chief LÃ©on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands. At the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports. ""Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,"" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs. Colombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts. Colombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved. The US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained. However, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti. An investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries. ""The mission was to arrest President Jovenel MoÃ¯se... and not to kill him,"" Judge ClÃ©ment NoÃ«l told Le Nouvelliste. Large crowds surrounded the PÃ©tion-Ville Police station in Port-au-Prince where the men have been detained Colombian daily El Tiempo said it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June. They crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. According to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic. The constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr MoÃ¯se had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests. Amendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over. But Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Both are claiming to be in charge. On Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM.

"The early Anglo-Saxon object found in North Norfolk 'looks like it fits into something else', an expert has said A mystery object found by a metal detector in Norfolk could be linked to a sword, an expert has said. The gilded silver early Anglo-Saxon object was found in Field Dalling in Norfolk last September and declared to be treasure this week. Norfolk finds liaison officer, Dr Helen Geake, said it looked ""a bit like a sword-ring"" but was not really like any others found so far. ""It's a bit of a mystery, but is probably related to swords,"" she said. The object, which measures 27.9mm (1.09in) by 25.3mm (0.9in), and weighs 17.8g (0.62oz), was listed as ""unidentified"" and dated from between 450-580 AD due to its ""amazing animal detail"". ""It is carved with very intricate animal art, and the Anglo Saxons were very connected to animals,"" Dr Geake said. ""We just don't know what it is."" A report sent to the Norfolk coroner said it was reminiscent of abuckle from Proosa,externalin Estonia and it shared elements of othersimilar buckles,externalon the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) database. Buckles may have been used on a baldric - or sword-belt - and so the mystery object may have been a matching mount. Its underside is like the mount of the Sutton Hoo shield which is derived from sword-ring fittings, the report said. Seal inscription mystery solved by man on Twitter WW2 names-on-bricks mystery solved The ancient treasures that inspired a Netflix film Dr Geake said they occasionally found a bit of a sword pommel - a fitting at the top of a sword handle - but the mystery object was not that. ""It is an odd-shape and has a cutaway bit so it looks like it fits into something else, like Lego,"" she said. ""It doesn't have any rivets to fix it on to something so when it gets to the British Museum we've asked for the underneath to be analysed for evidence of solder as it might have been soldered onto something. ""It's not an actual ring but is kind of circular but it is not like any known Anglo-Saxon sword ring. ""And it's really too big to find a space on a sword, they are used in battle so can't be too big."" She said it was ""yet another mystery"" and as BBC readers had ""a good track record in identifying artefacts"", if anybody had any ideas, they should contact the PAS in Norfolk.

"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week.
