"Matt Smith (L) and Tobias Menzies (R) both played Prince Philip in The Crown ""Don't. Be. Ridiculous."" That, according to actor Matt Smith, was apparently the Duke of Edinburgh's terse response when asked whether he had ever watched The Crown. Smith relayed the anecdote during a 2017interview with the Guardian,external, as he reflected on his time playing the duke in the hugely successful Netflix drama. The series portrays the inner life of Britain's modern-day Royal Family, from the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 to the break-up of Prince Charles's marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, in the early 1990s. The drama is set to continue in a new season in 2022. Claire Foy and Matt Smith as the royal couple in their early years It has been showered with praise for its lavish sets, immense budget, compelling script and accomplished cast, and the awards have followed. More controversial though has been its relationship with the truth. The royals are notoriously guarded about their private lives. Even the duke's supposed stinging rebuke when asked whether he had watched the series is a matter of debate. ""Whether it's true or not, I don't know, but I just think he's a bit of a cool cat,"" said Smith, after relating the second-hand anecdote. ""And that's what I love about him: he's done what he wants, when he wants, how he wants, with whom he wants. He hasn't asked permission. And his wife's the Queen."" The former Doctor Who star played the dashing, young Philip Mountbatten, who wooed Princess Elizabeth and became her royal consort. Yet there were, in reality, limits to how much the duke really did what he wanted. Smith's portrayal of Philip takes in many of the compromises the prince was forced to make - giving up his title as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, resigning his career in the navy and, ultimately, swearing allegiance to the Queen. When Elizabeth was crowned in 1953, Philip is depicted in the show asking her if he can be excused from kneeling to pay homage to her during the ceremony. Prince Philip (Matt Smith) knelt before the Queen (Claire Foy) during her 1953 coronation So what did his role teach Smith about the man himself? ""In this day and age, with all the conversations we're having about being a man and maleness, and what it is to be empowered and respected as a woman - I just found that thrilling,"" hetold BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. ""And also, I kind of sided with him, which is controversial. I felt, 'Yeah, I wouldn't really want to kneel to my wife'."" His enthusiasm for the character continued into season two when Smith said he saw the duke as a ""roguish, brilliant man"", adding: ""I just found a lot to celebrate in Philip."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered More on Prince Phillip's life,external The actor, who was Emmy-nominated in 2018 for playing the role, told Variety that year: ""I sort of loved Philip, and there was a lot that I could identify with: the competitiveness, the sporting nature, the battle, the defiance and the maleness. ""One of the interesting challenges for me was that I felt there was a sort of a misconception and a preconception about him, which reduced him a bit. ""And actually all the research I did found him to be brilliantly funny, very clever, very popular. In the royal house he's the most popular of all of them. If you've talked to any of the staff, Philip's the one they all love really. I think more than a lot of them, he's a bit more of a man of the people."" Smith was no less complimentary when reacting to news of the duke's death. ""Prince Philip was the man. And he knew it. 99 and out, but what an innings. And what style,"" he said. ""Thank you for your service old chap - it won't be the same without you."" Smith portrayed just a few of Prince Philip's 22,219 royal engagements The role of Philip was passed to Tobias Menzies in season three, when the middle-aged duke played opposite Olivia Colman. Speaking in the immediate aftermath of the duke's death on Friday, Menzies was the essence of modesty. ""If I know anything about the Duke of Edinburgh I'm fairly sure he wouldn't want some actor who has portrayed him on television giving their opinion on his life,"" he said, going on to quote the character of Orlando in Shakespeare's As You Like It. ""O good old man! how well in thee appears ""The constant service of the antique world..."" Before adding: ""Rest in Peace."" Tobias Menzies and Olivia Colman play an older version of the royal couple But some time before that, Menzies, who bleached his eyebrows for the role of the duke, wasasked by the LA Times,externalif he knew whether Prince Philip had watched his portrayal. ""'The crown doesn't comment.' I think that's the motto,"" he replied. He played the prince in seasons three and four, covering 1964 to 1990, and said that by this stage in his life, he ""has acclimatised"" and ""seems to be chafing at the bit less... and seems to have found his feet"". The Outlander actortold the New York Times,externalthat for Philip, season three was ""a continuation of themes in the first seasons: being second to his wife, sacrificing his own life and career to some extent"". Menzies told the LA Times it was a challenge playing the duke. ""They're quite guarded, both him and the Queen. Having watched a lot of footage of Philip and having read about him a lot, I find him quite a hard man to pin down. That makes him interesting to play."" The actor, who was nominated for a Golden Globe last year for his role in the show,told Screen Daily,externalplaying the royal was ""primarily a technical challenge... But it's a subtle thing to pitch - you don't want it to be pastiche or caricature"". Emma Corrin and Tobias Menzies playing Lady Diana Spencer and the duke during a stag hunt at Balmoral Season four's storylines featuring Prince Philip include a depiction of the early relationship between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The show suggests Prince Philip and Diana shared an affinity with each other. Speaking to Vanity Fair, Menzies said: ""Someone in production managed to get hold of copies of some letters between him and Diana. ""I was really struck by the kind of balanced, calm, quite tender kind of atmosphere to those letters. He clearly, behind the scenes, worked quite hard to mend that relationship. And if those letters are anything to go by, he does seem to have been a keen supporter of hers."" Jonathan Pryce will play the Duke of Edinburgh in the 1990s and early 2000s Thefinal actor to play Prince Philip in the serieswill be Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe-nominated Jonathan Pryce, who starred inThe Two Popeswith Sir Anthony Hopkins in 2019.

"Friends Nathan (left) and James were often in trouble with police before they signed up to do their bronze award What does the Duke of Edinburgh's Award mean to you? For many it will conjure memories of hauling a badly-packed rucksack across rainy British countryside in the hope of adding some sparkle to their CV. Yet for some of the millions of young people who have taken on the self-improvement challenge, it has brought truly life-changing opportunities. Without the award, James says he'd ""probably be in jail"". At the age of 15, James and his friend Nathan, then 16, had had more run-ins with the police than they care to remember. As bored mates growing up in Darlington, north-east England, they felt they had ""nothing else to do"" but to cause mischief. Illegally riding motorbikes for a bit of fun in their early teenage years turned into a succession of petty crimes - theft, anti-social behaviour, criminal damage. James describes his behaviour as ""causing mayhem"". Nathan adds: ""Wherever I was, I was causing trouble."" After being caught for separate offences, in 2018 the friends were both ordered to do hours of community service, or ""reparations"". The stint the pair enjoyed the most was being taught how to fix bikes by youth offending officer Dave Kirton, for a community project. Dave, who is also a Duke of Edinburgh leader, arranged with those on the reparations panel to strike a deal with the boys: if they did theirDuke of Edinburgh Bronze Award,external, they'd get five hours taken off their community service orders. ""It was a little bit of a reward, a carrot incentive,"" Dave says. ""Both the lads were a bit reluctant at first, but they agreed and two or three weeks in they realised the opportunity they had - and they got stuck right into it."" It takes about six months for most participants to complete the four sections of the bronze award: volunteering, a physical challenge, developing a skill and taking part in an expedition, which usually consists of two days of walking and a night of camping. The silver and gold awards are more challenging and take longer to complete. Prince Philip, pictured at a gold award presentation in 2017, believed the awards showed young people ""what can be achieved through determination and persistence"" James says the commitment needed for his bronze award - the first of three achievement levels - forced a change in his behaviour: ""It just stopped me being naughty."" Nathan says learning expedition skills such as navigation made him realise how quick he was at picking up new things. ""There's potential that you don't know you've got until you actually try it,"" he says. Nathan's realisation is exactly the kind of boost Prince Philip wanted to give young people when he first established the Duke of Edinburgh's Award for Boys in 1956. The idea, as expressed by the duke himself, was simple: ""If you can get a young person to succeed in any one activity, then that feeling of success will spread over into many others."" The roots of this idea lay in the self-reliance that helped Philip through his sometimes troubled childhood, and the experience of his time at school. Gordonstoun, the school both Prince Philip and Prince Charles attended,had a tough physical regimewith an emphasis on self-development - as depicted in the Netflix series The Crown. Gordonstoun schoolboys on an obstacle course in 1956 - the same year the Duke of Edinburgh set up his award programme In the beginning the duke's award was confined to boys, with 7,000 signing up in the first year. Girls were allowed to take part from 1958, but to begin with their programme had more emphasis on domestic skills and community service. The programme was made the same for girls and boys in 1980 - a move towards equality that helped one girl to overcome part of her traumatic childhood. Lauren (not her real name), was abused by her parents as a child. She says they used to dangle her from a balcony - an abusive pastime that left her terrified of heights. During Lauren's bronze award expedition in 2018, when she was 14, she was given the opportunity to take part in a high ropes course as an extra activity. ""I had a friend there that I'd met, and they were egging me on,"" she says. ""I finally did it and I felt so relieved."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures More on Prince Philip's life,external That day on the high ropes, Lauren's fear of heights disappeared. ""I can do anything now,"" she says. Lauren says the friends she made through the scheme have helped her gain the social skills needed to pursue a future career in social work. She says her aim is to help others who have had difficult childhoods. Those who complete the gold award get to experience a high of a different kind - being invited to a presentation ceremony at a royal residence. Several are held each year, either at St James's Palace or in Buckingham Palace gardens, in London, at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh, or at Hillsborough Castle, in County Down. Prince Philip attended more than 500 of gold award presentations himself - and other Royal Family members stood in if he was absent. He remained a patron of the organisation until his death. This video can not be played A look at the history of the programme as Prince Philip attends the 500th Gold Award presentation Mohammed Leily says he was ""thrilled"" to meet ""the man himself"" at one of Philip's final presentation events beforehe retired from royal duties in 2017. ""He went around and had a chat with each group,"" says Mohammed, who is still in touch with the friends he made through the programme. ""I remember he told us to make sure we are as active as we could possibly be, and to make sure we made use of our youth now while we have the energy."" Mohammed arrived to the UK from Syria as a refugee in 2013, aged 17, and decided to sign up for the bronze award as a way of meeting new people and improving his English. He revelled in the opportunity to volunteer for the Red Cross and help other refugees and asylum seekers settle into new homes. He credits his gold award with helping him to get a place to study medicine at the University of Southampton - and says he still can't believe he got to meet Prince Philip. ""When I left Syria I would never have imagined I'd do that, or see him."" One of the best things for Mohammed Leily was volunteering for the Red Cross, where he helped other refugees As of early 2021, more than 3.1 million Duke of Edinburgh's Awards had been achieved by people like Mohammed, Lauren, James and Nathan.The international arm of the scheme,externalmeans more than a million people more are currently taking part in programmes in more than 130 countries. But if the numbers have grown dramatically, the ideas remain simple. ""One of the perpetual problems about human life is that young people of every generation have to discover for themselves what life is all about,"" the duke said in 2010. ""These experiences teach more general lessons and serve as a practical demonstration of what can be achieved through determination and persistence."" Back in Darlington, those lessons have certainly been learned by James and Nathan. Neither has reoffended since completing their bronze award. ""It makes you happy knowing you're pal's all right and doing well for himself,"" says Nathan. ""And it makes us happy knowing that we've both changed together.""

"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, won widespread respect for his steadfast and constant support of the Queen. It was a desperately difficult role for anyone, let alone a man who had been used to naval command and who held strong views on a wide range of subjects. Yet it was that very strength of character that enabled him to discharge his responsibilities so effectively, and provide such wholehearted support to his wife in her role as Queen. As male consort to a female sovereign, Prince Philip had no constitutional position. But no-one was closer to the monarchy, or of greater importance to the monarch, than he was. Prince Philip of Greece was born on 10 June 1921 on the island of Corfu. His birth certificate shows the date as 28 May 1921, as Greece had not then adopted the Gregorian calendar. His father was Prince Andrew of Greece, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and sister of Earl Mountbatten of Burma. After a coup d'etat in 1922, his father was banished from Greece by a revolutionary court. A British warship sent by his second cousin, King George V, took the family to Italy. Baby Philip spent much of the voyage in a crib made from an orange box. His mother, Princess Alice, was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria He was the youngest child, the only boy in a family of sisters - and his early childhood was spent in a loving atmosphere. The prince began his education in France but, at the age of seven, came to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. By this time his mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and been placed in an asylum. The young prince would have little contact with her. In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany, which was run by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn. But within months, Hahn, who was Jewish, was forced to flee Nazi persecution. Hahn moved to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun school, to which the prince transferred after only two terms in Germany. Gordonstoun's Spartan regime, with its emphasis on self-reliance, was the ideal environment for a teenage boy who, separated from his parents, felt very much on his own. With war looming, Prince Philip decided on a military career. He wanted to join the Royal Air Force but his mother's family had a seafaring tradition and he became a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. While there he was delegated to escort the two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the college. According to witnesses, Prince Philip showed off a great deal. But the meeting made a deep impression on the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Philip quickly proved himself an outstanding prospect, passing out at the top of his class in January 1940 and seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. Philip (seated) thrived at Gordonstoun where he enjoyed amateur dramatics He transferred to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet, where he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. As the officer in charge of the ship's searchlights, he played a crucial role in this decisive night action. ""I found another ship and it lit up the middle part of it, whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15in shells at point-blank range,""he told BBC Radio 4 in 2014. By October 1942, he was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy, serving on board the destroyer HMS Wallace. Throughout this period, he and the young Princess Elizabeth had been exchanging letters, and he was invited to stay with the Royal Family on a number of occasions. It was after one of these visits, over Christmas 1943, that Elizabeth placed a photograph of Philip, in naval uniform, on her dressing table. Their relationship developed in peacetime, although there was opposition to it from some courtiers - one of whom described Prince Philip as ""rough and ill-mannered"". But the young princess was very much in love and, in the summer of 1946, her suitor asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage. Philip had a distinguished naval career However, before an engagement could be announced, the prince needed a new nationality and a family name. He renounced his Greek title, became a British citizen and took his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten. The day before the marriage ceremony, King George VI bestowed the title of His Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding day he was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. It was, as Winston Churchill put it, a ""flash of colour"" in a grey post-war Britain. The duke returned to his naval career and was posted to Malta where, for a while at least, the couple could live the life of any other service family. Their son, Prince Charles, was born at Buckingham Palace in 1948, and a daughter, Princess Anne, arrived in 1950. They were later joined by Prince Andrew (1960) and Prince Edward (1964). On 2 September 1950, he achieved the ambition of every naval officer when he was appointed to his own command, the sloop HMS Magpie. But his naval career was about to be curtailed. The worsening health of George VI meant his daughter had to take on more royal duties and needed her husband by her side. His wedding to Princess Elizabeth was described as ""a flash of colour in a grey post-war Britain"" Philip took leave from the Royal Navy in July 1951. He never returned in an active role. The duke was not a man to carry regrets, but he did say in later life that he was sorry he had been unable to continue his career in the navy. Contemporaries have said that he could, on his own merit, have risen to become first sea lord. In 1952, the royal couple set off on a tour of the Commonwealth originally planned to be undertaken by the King and Queen. It was while they were staying at a game lodge in Kenya in February that word came through the King had died. He had suffered a coronary thrombosis - a fatal heart blood clot. It fell to the prince to break the news to his wife that she was now Queen. A friend later described Prince Philip as looking as if ""half the world"" had dropped on him. Philip was the first to pay homage to the Queen at her coronation Deprived of his naval career, he had to create a new role for himself, and Elizabeth's accession to the throne raised the whole question of what that was to be. As the coronation approached, a Royal Warrant proclaimed that Prince Philip would have precedence after the Queen on all occasions, yet he was never to have any constitutional position. The duke was full of ideas about how best to modernise and streamline the monarchy but became increasingly disillusioned by the entrenched opposition from a number of the palace old guard. He channelled some of his energies into an active social life. He and a group of male friends met every week in rooms above a restaurant in Soho, central London. There were long, convivial lunches and visits to nightclubs and he was often photographed with glamorous companions. One area in which the duke was given free rein to exercise his authority was in the family, although he lost the battle over the name his children would carry. He had to adapt to life as a royal consort The Queen's decision that the family would carry the name of Windsor, rather than his own family name of Mountbatten, was a bitter blow. ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,"" he complained to friends. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba."" As a parent, Prince Philip could appear brusque and insensitive. According to Prince Charles's biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles was reduced to tears in his youth by public reprimands from his father and the relationship between father and eldest son was never easy. Philip insisted that Prince Charles go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the well-intentioned belief that its regime would help counter his son's somewhat retiring nature. In the event the young prince hated the school, where he suffered homesickness and was often the target of bullies. The duke's attitudes reflected the difficult nature of his own, sometimes lonely, childhood. He was forced from an early age to develop self-reliance and found it difficult to understand that not everyone shared his strength of character. His insistence that Prince Charles attend Gordonstoun caused a rift between father and son One of Prince Philip's main concerns was for the welfare of young people, and in 1956 that interest sparked the launch of his phenomenally successful Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Over the years it enabled some six million 15-to-25-year-olds - many with disabilities - the world over to challenge themselves physically, mentally and emotionally in a range of outdoor activities designed to promote teamwork, resourcefulness and a respect for nature. ""If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,"" he told the BBC, ""that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others."" Throughout his life the duke continued to devote much time to the scheme, attending various functions and involving himself in its day-to-day running. He was also a passionate advocate for wildlife and the environment, although his decision to shoot a tiger while on a trip to India in 1961 caused a furore. The publication of a photograph, in which the tiger was displayed as a trophy, only made matters worse. However, he threw his considerable influence and energy behind the World Wildlife Fund, later to become the World Wide Fund for Nature, and seemed a natural choice as its first president. The Duke of Edinburgh threw himself into his conservation efforts with typical energy and enthusiasm ""I think it's marvellous we have such a fantastic variety of life on this planet, all interdependent,"" he told a BBC interviewer. ""I think also that if we humans have the power of life or death - or extinction or survival - we ought to exercise it with some sort of moral sense. Why make something extinct if you don't have to?"" He upset some conservationists when he defended grouse shooting. ""If you have a game species, you want it to survive because you want to have some next year - exactly like a farmer. You want to crop it, you don't want to exterminate it."" But he was widely praised for his commitment to preserving the world's forests and campaigning against overfishing in the oceans. Prince Philip also took a keen interest in industry, visiting factories and becoming patron of the Industrial Society, now known as the Work Foundation. It was to a group of industrialists in 1961 that the duke displayed characteristic bluntness when he told them: ""Gentlemen, it's time we pulled our fingers out."" He took a keen interest in British industry This tendency to be forthright was interpreted by some as boorishness and sometimes got him into trouble. He certainly gained a reputation for misjudging situations, particularly when he was abroad. He made one of his most controversial comments while accompanying the Queen on a state visit to China in 1986. He made what he thought was a private remark about ""slitty eyes"". The tabloids went into a frenzy, although it seemed to cause little concern in China. On a visit to Australia in 2002, he asked an Aboriginal businessman whether ""you still throw spears at each other"". While he was heavily criticised in some quarters for such remarks, others saw them as reflecting someone who was his own man and who had refused to become bound by political correctness. Indeed, many saw his so-called ""gaffes"" as nothing more than an attempt to lighten the atmosphere and put people at their ease. Throughout his life, Prince Philip maintained an enthusiasm for sport. He sailed, played cricket and polo, excelled at carriage driving and was president of the International Equestrian Federation for many years. He had a particular passion for polo The tensions with his eldest son resurfaced with the publication of Jonathan Dimbleby's biography of Prince Charles. The Duke of Edinburgh, it was said, had pushed Charles into his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. Yet the duke was more solicitous than many critics would allow during the difficult years when his children's marriages were disintegrating. He took the lead in attempting to understand the problems, prompted perhaps by his own memories of the difficulties of marrying into the Royal Family. Prince Philip was greatly saddened by the ending of the marriages of three of his four children - Princess Anne and Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Charles. But he always refused to talk about personal matters, telling a newspaper in 1994 that he had not done so before and was not going to start then. Advancing years barely slowed the pace of his life. He continued to travel extensively, both for the World Wide Fund for Nature and with the Queen on state visits abroad. Carriage driving was one of the duke's many sporting interests And he made a personal pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1994 to visit the tomb of his mother. Her wish to be buried there had been fulfilled. There was another poignant moment for him during the 50th anniversary of VJ Day in 1995. Prince Philip had been on a British destroyer in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered and, on the anniversary, he joined other veterans of the Far East campaign in marching past the Queen on The Mall. He also expressed sympathy for those former prisoners of the Japanese who had found it hard, or indeed impossible, to forgive what had been done to them. His brusqueness mellowed a little in later years, prompted by the public's sometimes hostile attitude to the Royal Family after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. He was a source of great support to Diana, Princess of Wales In 2007, letters between the duke and the princess were published in an attempt to refute claims that he had been hostile to his daughter-in-law. Dubbed the Dearest Pa letters, they showed he had been a source of great support to Diana, a fact underlined by the warm tones in which she wrote to him. Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Diana's last companion, Dodi, even suggested at the inquest into her death that she had been murdered on Prince Philip's orders - an allegation the coroner strongly rejected. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a strong-willed and independent man who found himself at the centre of British society. He was a natural leader whose role forced him always to take second place; a man with a combative temperament that frequently sat uneasily with the sensitivities of his position. ""I've just done what I think was my best,"" he once told the BBC. ""I can't suddenly change my whole way of doing things, I can't change my interests or the way I react to things. That's just my style."" The Queen referred to him as her 'strength and stay' The duke retired from public life in August 2017 after decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. Buckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952, and Theresa May, the then prime minister, thanked him for a ""remarkable life of public service"". Philip celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary later that year. An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London A hip replacement operation did not stop him driving his carriages around the grounds of Windsor Castle, and he survived a serious car accident while driving near Sandringham in January 2019. Two women in the other car were injured, and the duke voluntarily surrendered his driver's licence. During the coronavirus pandemic, Philip and the Queen moved to Windsor Castle, and were given a vaccine in January 2021. Philip was successful in using his position to make a huge contribution to British life and played his part in helping the monarchy come to terms with changing social attitudes over the years. But his greatest achievement was undoubtedly the constancy and strength of his support for the Queen in the long years of her reign. He believed his job was, as he told his biographer, ""to ensure the Queen can reign"". At a speech given at a celebration to mark the couple's golden wedding anniversary, the Queen paid tribute to her husband, the longest-serving royal consort in British history. ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has quite simply been my strength and stay all these years. And I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know.""

"The Duke of Edinburgh, arguably the world's most famous husband, has died at the age of 99. He spent seven decades in the shadow of his wife, the UK's Queen Elizabeth II - but his force of personality meant he would never be simply a professional spouse. So who was the man beside the monarch, and how did he come to marry the Queen? First things first: The Duke, also known as Prince Philip, was never in line for the throne - which his eldest son stands to inherit - and never held the title of king. That's because in the UK, a woman who marries the monarch can use the ceremonial title of queen - but men who marry the monarch can't use the title king, which can only be used by male sovereigns. The Queen and Prince Philip had four children together: Prince Charles, 72, Princess Anne, 70, Prince Andrew, 61, and 57-year-old Prince Edward. As they tell it, Philip often exerted his will when they were young. Royal biographer Ingrid Seward quotes Prince Andrew as saying of his childhood: ""Compassion comes from the Queen. And the duty and discipline comes from him."" But Andrew also remembered how his father made time to invent bedtime tales, or listen to his children read Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories. Prince Philip lived long enough to see his eight grandchildren grow up, and to welcome 10 great-grandchildren. Who's in line for the British throne? Who are the youngest British royals? Curiously, Philip's journey to Buckingham Palace began back in 1922, in a crib made from an orange box. He was born on 10 June 1921 on the Greek island of Corfu, the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That heritage made him a prince of Greece and Denmark, but the following year the family was banished from Greece after a coup. Princess Alice and the young Prince Philip, after being exiled from Greece A British warship carried them to safety in Italy, with baby Philip dozing in a makeshift fruit crate cot. Philip's childhood was fragmented, and darkened by a series of losses. In 1930, when he was eight years old, his mother was committed to a secure psychiatric centre after suffering a nervous breakdown. Philip saw little of either parent in the years that followed. His father retreated to the French Riviera with a mistress, and his mother's relatives in the UK helped raise him. He would later adopt their surname, Mountbatten - an anglicised form of the family name Battenberg. A Scottish boarding school, Gordonstoun, passed for home during his teens. Its founder and headmaster was Jewish educational pioneer Kurt Hahn, who had been forced out of Germany for condemning the Nazis. The man who taught Prince Philip to think The school gave Philip structure, and nurtured his self-reliance. Its somewhat Spartan regime saw pupils rise early for a freezing shower and cross-country running, which Hahn believed would combat the ""poisonous passions"" of adolescence. Pupils at Gordonstoun School tackle an obstacle course At Gordonstoun, boys were put through a rigorous exercise programme alongside their academic studies In 1937, one of Philip's four sisters, Cecilie, died in an air crash along with her German husband, mother-in-law, and two young sons. She was heavily pregnant at the time. Cecilie had recently joined the Nazi party, which had near-totalitarian control of Germany. Grieving Philip, aged 16, walked through the streets of Darmstadt behind his sister's coffin, past crowds giving ""Heil Hitler"" salutes. ""It's simply what happened,"" Prince Philip later said of that time. ""The family broke up. My mother was ill, my sisters were married, my father was in the south of France. I just had to get on with it. You do. One does."" When Philip left school, Britain was on the verge of war with Germany. He joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth (the UK's naval academy), where he proved a brilliant cadet and graduated top of his class. When King George VI paid an official visit in July 1939, Philip was charged with entertaining his young daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. Their governess, Marion Crawford (employed as a guardian for the princesses), recalled later that Philip had ""showed off a great deal"". He made quite an impression on the 13-year-old Elizabeth, as would soon become clear. A rare picture of Prince Philip at Gordonstoun, shortly before he met Princess Elizabeth Prince Philip served with distinction in World War Two, seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. By October 1942, he was 21 years old - and one of the Royal Navy's youngest first lieutenants. The teenaged princess and the officer kept in touch by letter. Over Christmas 1943, after Philip had been to stay with the Royal Family, a photograph of him in naval uniform appeared on her dressing room table. It was a decisive gesture from a reserved but determined young woman. Some aides were sceptical. A famous sneer (since attributed to more than one official) claimed the prince was ""rough, ill-mannered, uneducated and would probably not be faithful"". But naysayers could do nothing to deter the future Queen. According to biographer Philip Eade, Philip's letters from 1946 reveal an ardent young man with a new sense of purpose. He wrote to his soon-to-be mother-in-law: ""I am sure I do not deserve all the good things that have happened to me. To have been spared in the war and seen victory, to have been given the chance to rest and to re-adjust myself, to have fallen in love completely and unreservedly, makes all one's personal and even the world's troubles seem small and petty."" Princess Elizabeth and her husband-to-be outside Buckingham Palace in 1947, after announcing their engagement King George gave Philip permission to marry his daughter. But first there were some tweaks to make. The erstwhile Prince of Greece and Denmark became a naturalised British subject, formally joined the Church of England and abandoned his foreign titles. On his wedding day, 20 November 1947, he was made Duke of Edinburgh, a name he was widely known by for the rest of his life. He was 26, and his new wife 21. 60 facts about the Queen's marriage,external The royal couple would have just over four years (and two children) together before duty came knocking. The fateful news reached them at a game lodge in Kenya, during their 1952 tour of the Commonwealth. King George VI, Elizabeth's father, was dead at 56. Commander Michael Parker, the Duke of Edinburgh's friend and private secretary, described the moment he realised his wife was now Queen. ""He looked as if you'd dropped half the world on him. I have never felt so sorry for anyone in all my life. He just breathed heavily, in and out, as though he were in shock. He saw immediately that the idyll of their life together had come to an end."" Philip's naval ambitions were curbed. The new Queen Elizabeth would need her husband by her side. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip with their baby daughter Princess Anne and son Prince Charles, in 1950 The Duke of Edinburgh was named as the Queen's consort. His primary function was to support his wife. WATCH: Coronation memories: Queen's advice on wearing a crown A long-running row broke out in the early 1950s when Philip wanted the Royal Family to take his surname, Mountbatten. ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children!"" he fumed when the Queen was persuaded to keep Windsor. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba!"" Philip struggled to find purpose in the limited role set out for him. But as a natural pragmatist, he was determined to blow fresh air through the stuffier corridors of Buckingham Palace. The Duke never forgot his family's forced exodus from Greece, and believed monarchies must adapt to survive. He set up informal lunches where the Queen could meet people from a broader range of backgrounds. The footmen - palace servants with a traditional uniform - stopped powdering their hair. And when he learned the palace was running a second kitchen exclusively to feed the royals, he had one shut down. A table prepared for dinner at Buckingham Palace Some changes were more personal, and reflected his childlike love of gadgets. Before the Coronation, when Philip and the future Queen moved into Clarence House in 1949, he happily installed an array of labour-saving devices, including one in his wardrobe that would eject a suit at the push of a button. The Duke also championed a 90-minute fly-on-the-wall BBC documentary entitled Royal Family, which aired in 1969 and was considered landmark television. It featured the Queen feeding carrots to her Trooping the Colour horse, watching TV and discussing salad at a Balmoral barbecue while Princess Anne cooked sausages. At Buckingham Palace, Philip had intercoms put in so that servants no longer had to ferry written messages to his wife. He carried his own luggage, and cooked his own breakfast in his rooms with an electric frying pan - until the Queen objected to the smell. Prince Philip was heavily involved with the ground-breaking documentary Royal Family As the longest-serving consort in British history, the prince took on some 22,191 solo engagements. When he retired from royal duties in 2017,he was said to be patron, president or a member of more than 780 organisations. Accompanying the globetrotting Queen on Commonwealth tours and state visits, he visited 143 countries in an official capacity, making use of his fluent French and German. The countries included Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation, where he is revered by one rainforest community as the reincarnation of an ancient warrior. On Tanna island in Vanuatu, some islanders view Prince Philip as a sacred figure But one of his most enduring legacies is the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, founded in 1956 at the urging of his former headmaster, Kurt Hahn. Participants aged 14-25 can gain awards by doing volunteer work, learning physical activities and skills, and undertaking an expedition like a mountain trek or a sailing trip. In 2016, almost 1.3 million young people were taking part in the scheme in more than 130 countries and territories worldwide. ""If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,"" its founder told the BBC, ""that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others."" In his spare time, Philip was a talented sportsman. He learned to sail at Gordonstoun, and became a regular competitor in the regatta at Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, where sailing races are held each summer. Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London He loved equine sports, including carriage driving, and was among the UK's top four polo players in the mid-1960s. He was also a committed environmental campaigner and wildlife advocate, becoming president of the World Wildlife Fund (UK) in 1961 - though he faced criticism when a picture emerged of him on a tiger shoot with the Queen in India the same year. The Queen (C), between the Maharaja and Maharani of Jaipur, India, and Prince Philip (L) pose with the tiger he killed in 1961 Asked to sum up his contribution to British life, Prince Philip responded with typical frankness: ""I've just done what I think is my best. Some people think it's all right. Some don't. What can you do? I can't change my way of doing things. It's part of my style. It's just too bad, they'll have to lump it."" The prince drew repeated controversy by making outspoken or racially insensitive comments, including in 1986 when he told a group of British students in China: ""If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed."" Critics deemed him gaffe-prone and out of touch. His defenders saw the prince as a product of his times who was trying to share a joke. Insiders said laughter was the glue that kept the forthright Prince Philip and the Queen together. He himself suggested it was her tolerance. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, pictured in 2007, spent seven decades together The Queen's once-favoured speech-opener, ""my husband and I..."", was mocked in the 1960s and afterwards by satirists who called it archaic and stilted. She retired the phrasing, but the sentiment remained. Her Majesty, now simply ""I"", summed up Prince Philip in a heartfelt speech for their Golden Wedding anniversary. ""All too often, I fear, Prince Philip has had to listen to me speaking. Frequently we have discussed my intended speech beforehand and, as you will imagine, his views have been expressed in a forthright manner. ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.""

"The Duke of Edinburgh was born in the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921. His family tree includes members of the royal families of Denmark, Germany, Russia and Britain. Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. The prince began his education in France at the MacJannet American school in St-Cloud and is seen here (second from left) with his schoolmates. At the age of seven he went to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. Later he attended Gordonstoun boarding school, founded by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn in northern Scotland, where he excelled at sport. This is believed to be the first time Princess Elizabeth (third from left) and the then naval cadet Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark (in the white cap on the far right) were pictured together. It was taken during a visit to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth on 23 July 1939. During World War Two, Prince Philip saw action as a midshipman on the battleship HMS Valiant. When the Italian fleet was trapped off Greece in 1941, Philip commanded the searchlights that illuminated the enemy and he was later mentioned in dispatches. His engagement to Princess Elizabeth was officially announced in July 1947. They married on 20 November that year. In 1951 a photographer caught the moment the Duke of Edinburgh jumped off his water skis as he reached the beach at Marmaris in Turkey. It was taken during his last posting as commander of HMS Magpie. The prince is seen here playing polo for Cowdray Park in the semi-finals of the Roehampton Cup. He was one of the leading polo players in Britain. The duke was also a keen cricketer. Here his team, made up of former England stars, were pitted against one captained by the Duke of Norfolk, with Sussex players. The duke and Queen had four children, (from left) Edward, Andrew, Anne and Charles, pictured here in the 1960s. The couple are seen here during a visit to a farm on their Balmoral estate, to celebrate their Silver Wedding anniversary. In 1977 the prince accompanied the Queen as she celebrated her Silver Jubilee. They are seen here both wearing Maori Kahu-Kiwi (Kiwi feather cloaks) at Rugby Park in Gisborne, on the North Island of New Zealand when they attended the opening of the Royal New Zealand Polynesian Festival in February. Later that year the royal couple waved as Concorde flew past the Royal Yacht Britannia as they neared Barbados. In August 1979 the Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA bomb blast on his boat in Ireland. The Duke of Edinburgh returned to the UK after hearing the news, having taken part in a coach-driving championship in Normandy, northern France. Nature and conservation were lifelong passions of the Duke of Edinburgh and he seemed a natural choice to become the international president of what was then the World Wildlife Fund. In 1985 the Duke of Edinburgh was surrounded by his family, including the young princes William and Harry, as they gathered to watch a flypast over Buckingham Palace after Trooping the Colour. In 1996 the duke escorted the South African President Nelson Mandela as he prepared to review an honour guard in Horse Guards Parade on the first day of his state visit to Britain. Prince Philip supported the Queen through more than 60 years of her reign, including the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. The prince set up the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, which is aimed at developing young people's abilities, in 1956. Here he shares a joke with Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holders at Holyroodhouse in 2010. The duke continued to compete in sport late in his life, including this carriage-driving event at Sandringham in 2005. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace to greet the Royal Family after the wedding of Prince Philip's grandson, Prince William, to Catherine Middleton in 2011. Twelve months later, the prince had appeared to be in good health when he accompanied the Queen on the royal barge, the Spirit of Chartwell, which formed part of the rain-drenched Diamond Jubilee river pageant on 3 June 2012. He and the Queen stood for most of the 80-minute journey, as they were accompanied by 1,000 boats travelling seven miles down the River Thames to Tower Bridge. However, the duke was admitted to hospital with a bladder infection before the Diamond Jubilee concert on 4 June. After making a recovery, he was fit enough to accompany Princess Anne to watch Great Britain's equestrian team, which included his granddaughter Zara Phillips, compete in the eventing at the 2012 London Olympics. In June 2013 the duke attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation. In 2014 he accompanied the Queen on a tour of Northern Ireland. He is pictured here signing the visitors book at Hillsborough Castle, Belfast. Queen Elizabeth II accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh lit the first of more than 200 beacons to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE Day at Windsor Castle. The duke and his son Charles shared a funny moment together during a visit to Poundbury, an urban development on the edge of Dorchester, where the Queen unveiled a statue of the Queen Mother. In April 2017 the duke accompanied his wife to open a new Centre for Elephant Care at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. In May however he announced he was to stand down from public engagements at the age of 95, with the full support of the Queen. Alongside the Queen the duke observed a minute's silence at the start of a garden party at Buckingham Palace on 23 May 2017 in tribute to those killed at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The duke has been the longest-serving royal consort in British history.

"In public, Prince Philip always took second place He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him. And so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company. With his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man. His mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. His four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding. When peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the ""white heat of the technological revolution"", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable. Eighteen months after his birth, his family was in exile His childhood quickly taught him the values of self-reliance He was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, ""the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,"" as his sister Sophia later described it. In Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him. ""I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,"" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links. By the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea. Philip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. Prince Philip became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy But he had to give up his career to support the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children would not bear his name, Mountbatten That ethos became a significant, perhapsthesignificant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. ""The essence of freedom,"" he would say in Ghana in 1958, ""is discipline and self-control."" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important ""but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living"". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the ""importance of the individual"" as the ""guiding principle of our society"". And at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. And yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last? The navy ran deep in the Duke of Edinburgh's family. He is pictured sitting at the wheel of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Churchill Prince Philip gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests At Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. The navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, ""Dickie"" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. ""Prince Philip"", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, ""will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength"". Others had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  ""If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,"" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. ""One of his crew,"" writes another biographer, ""said he would rather die than serve under him again."" In Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. ""It is an extraordinary master or mistress,"" he would say later, ""it has such extraordinary moods.""  But a rival to the sea would come. When King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip. Prince Philip with his uncle, Earl Mountbatten, at the Royal Marines Barracks in 1965 The Queen, with one of the Royal corgis, chats with polo-playing Prince Philip at Windsor Great Park Their engagement was announced in July 1947 Did he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end. He knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, ""as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him"". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably. For someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. ""There's never been 'if only',"" he said once, ""except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy"". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, ""I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it."" That moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, ""It takes a man to have a boy."" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen. He would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her ""liege man of life and limb"". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,"" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband. Prince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. ""Within the house,"" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, ""I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably."" Prince Philip had hundreds of patronages and projects with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport Prince Philip helped sustain the monarchy The transition to life in the Palace was brutal. ""Philip,"" said his equerry, ""was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers."" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was ""difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive"". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany. In response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s. At home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. Within the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. ""He believes he has a creative mission,"" wrote an early biographer, ""to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society."" He was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment. In his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a ""splendid gadget"" that he called ""a miniature word processor"".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. Out of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. ""A lot of time and energy,"" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, ""has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already."" Reflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (""it seems to me..."") garnered from his extensive travels. Despite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of ""urban dwellers"" and of the ""average citizen"" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - ""The enterprise is doomed,"" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, ""if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory."" He was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the ""greedy and senseless exploitation of nature."" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, ""a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" which he referred to as the ""greenhouse effect"". His relationship with his eldest son improved in later years And he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: ""I have very little experience of self-government,"" he told one audience, ""I am one of the most governed people you could meet...."" His example of irrational behaviour? - ""making and listening to speeches on important occasions"". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - ""I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions."" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. It is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his ""gaffes"", off-colour comments and salty jokes. That he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. There was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did. Looking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say ""I don't know why you are bothering"". He once said of his son Charles: ""He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling."" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. And the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. ""Life,"" wrote one biographer, ""hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick."" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. ""What the royal family offers you is friendliness,"" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, ""not friendship."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London Major General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he ""asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine"". It was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. Because of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. ""A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,"" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, ""needs a loose fit portrait."" He was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? ""Absolutely, absolutely,"" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other ""followers"", with trademark modesty. ""Our only distinction,"" he said, ""was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it."" The Royal family Â© 2025 BBC.

"""His energy was astonishing,"" Prince Charles said of his father in his support of the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children have shared their reflections on their father's life, his ""astonishing achievement"" and his legacy. The Prince of Wales told the BBC ""his energy was astonishing in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time"". ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life,"" said the Earl of Wessex. The Princess Royal praised the ""double act"" he created with the monarch. And the Duke of York fondly recalled Prince Philip as a father spending time with his family. ""Like any other family at the time, your parents went out to work during the day but in the evening - just the same as any other family - we would get together, we would sit on the sofa as a group and he would read to us,"" Prince Andrew said. The royals were speaking in interviews to mark the Duke of Edinburgh's death as part of a BBC special programme billed as a tribute ""from those who knew him best"". Prince Charles told the programme: ""I think he'll probably want to be remembered as an individual in his own right."" Princess Anne reflected on the ""incredible challenge"" of moving from a career in the Royal Navy to royal consort Reflecting on his father's difficult upbringing after his family was exiled, he said: ""It can't have been easy and life was uncertain and everyone had to rely on other people to help - and presumably he had to fall back on himself."" This uncertain upbringing left him with the ""extraordinary ability"" to be positive and move on from adversity, said Princess Anne. Prince Charles spoke of the ""huge value"" his father found in his education at Gordonstoun under its founder Kurt Hahn, an unconventional figure who emphasised self-reliance and risking - and who partly inspired the creation of the Duke of Edinburgh's award. Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures More on Prince Philip's life,external Moving from a career in the Royal Navy to become royal consort was ""an incredible challenge"", Princess Anne said. ""In the Royal Navy he was in charge of ships, he was making all the decisions. In his next life, he was making very few."" But Prince Andrew, who served in the navy during the Falklands War, said he had never had any discussions with his father about whether he would have stayed on in the service. ""He saw his role as supporting the Queen,"" the prince said. Princess Anne spoke of how his appreciation of how he could help the Queen ""always seemed to be present"" and was vital because she succeeded to the throne so young. ""They needed to be a double act for a lot of that time to allow her to take on that role,"" she said. Prince Edward recalled a ""lovely moment"" when his mother was able to pay tribute to his father at the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, by giving the organisation a Royal Charter. ""It probably meant more to my mother anyway. My father is far too modest to be remotely interested in all that sort of thing, he would brush it off,"" the prince said. He said the award was a result of Prince Philip's belief ""that if you could tap into what a young person's passion was, that would drive them forward in terms of their life and their success"". Prince Edward said he was ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance all the way through"" while Princess Anne added: ""I think I will best remember him as always being there and a person you could bounce off ideas, but if you were having problems you could always go to him."" Prince Philip's legendary ""directness"" was inherited from his mother, Prince Charles explained with an anecdote. The duke took on his role with ""extraordinary tact and diplomacy"", said Prince Edward His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was buried in Jerusalem, where she is also honoured at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" for protecting Jews at her house in Athens during World War Two. ""My father said, but hang on, how are we ever going to visit your grave?"" the Prince of Wales recalled. ""She said, don't be so silly, there's a very good bus service from Athens."" The Duke of Edinburgh ""did not suffer fools gladly"", Prince Charles said, which ""made one choose your words carefully"". Prince Edward said had taken on a challenging role ""with the most extraordinary flair, and the most extraordinary tact and diplomacy - he's never, ever tried to overshadow the Queen in any way, shape or form. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same."" ""His energy was astonishing, in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time,"" said Prince Charles. ""What he's done has amounted to an astonishing achievement, I think.""

Sir Richard Sutton, 83,died at his mansion near Gillingham, Dorset, on Wednesday night. A woman, in her 60s and believed to be his partner, was also stabbed and remains in a critical condition.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The tests are coming out too expensive, we are trying to drive that down."" People in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. But he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry. Mr Shapps has also given more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk. Passengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk ""green"" countries. There will also be a watch list for countries most at risk of going from green to amber to provide greater assurance for those looking to travel abroad. When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Which countries are on the UK's travel ban list? Announcing thefindings of the Global Travel Taskforce,externalset up by the government to examine how leisure travel could be reopened safely after lockdown, Mr Shapps said foreign holidays would resume on 17 May at the earliest. He told the BBC: ""This is the first time I'm able to come on and say I'm not advising against booking foreign holidays. ""Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. ""But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place."" Mr Shapps said the use of PCR tests - those needing to be sent to a lab - enabled scientists to detect potential variants of concern. But he said he was ""concerned"" about the cost of the tests, adding that the government was committed to driving down the price of these by working with the private sector. The transport secretary also said the government was looking at the possibility of people bringing pre-departure tests with them that they can use before boarding their return flight, pointing out that people are now able to order free lateral flow tests. On Friday,the UK confirmed another 3,150 virus cases,external, and another 60 deaths of people who had tested positive in the past 28 days. Mr Shapps said countries would be categorised based on level of infections and vaccinations, variants of concern and the quality of their genetic sequencing. He said this list would be kept under constant review and that he was hopeful European countries would be upgraded as their vaccination rates improve. Mr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. The government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. Nearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK. The earliest date holidays abroad could be allowed under the current roadmap out of lockdown is 17 May The rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said. Further formal reviews will take place at ""checkpoints"" no later than 31 July and 1 October. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. He told the BBC: ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red."" The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be ""premature"" to book a foreign summer trip. In other developments: People in England can now order free lateral flow tests, as the governmentencourages people to get into the habit of testing themselves twice a week,external Gyms will be allowed to reopen and people will be able to form extended householdsa week earlier than planned in Wales At the moment, almost anyone seeking to travel to Englandmust first take a coronavirus test,externalbefore departure and then two tests when they arrive, bought through a private provider. Children under 11 are exempt. Consumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed -could cost about Â£120 per person.,external However, the government said it would work with airlines, travel firms and the test providers to see whether prices can be reduced. That could involve cheaper tests, or the government providing the pre-departure tests. Test travel regime must be easy and cheap, says PM How is Europe dealing with the third wave? The government's plans have been met with mixed reaction from the travel industry. Heathrow Airport chief executive officer John Holland-Kaye expressed concern about the requirement for PCR testing, adding ""we need to make sure that travel is something anyone can do and is not just something for the wealthy"" Industry body Airlines UK said that the proposed framework ""does not represent a reopening of travel as promised by ministers"" Mark Tanzer, boss of travel trade organisation Abta, said permitting the use of lateral flow tests would ""make international travel more accessible and affordable"" Jet2.com has extended the suspension of its flights and holidays up to 23 June following the government's announcement Tui said it was ""disappointed"" at the ""expensive"" testing and quarantine measures proposed The travel industry says lateral flow tests, which are cheaper and faster, would be preferable to PCR tests Test travel regime must be easy and cheap, says PM 'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"Mr Kim made his rare admission of looming hardship at a party conference North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has told citizens to prepare for hard times ahead, following warnings from rights groups that the country faces dire food shortages and economic instability. Speaking at a party conference, Mr Kim appeared to compare the situation to the devastating 1990s famine, estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands. North Korea has shut its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trade with China, its economic lifeline, has come to a standstill. This is on top of existing international economic sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Imagine a North Korean family... North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The South Koreans enslaved in the North's mines In a rare admission of looming hardship, the authoritarian leader of the single-party state on Thursday called on officials to ""wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little"". The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death is not known, but estimates range up to 3 million. North Korea often struggles to feed its people ""It is not unusual for Kim Jong-un to talk about difficulties and hardship but this time the language is quite stark and that's different,"" Colin Zwirko, North Korea analyst at NK News, told the BBC. ""Last October for instance,he gave a speech where he said that he himself failed to bring about enough changes. But mentioning explicitly that he's decided to carry out a new Arduous March is not something he has said before."" Earlier this week, Mr Kim had warned the country faced the ""worst-ever situation"" and ""unprecedentedly numerous challenges"". There have been warnings for months that the people of North Korea are struggling. Reports of hardship appear to be coming especially from towns near the Chinese border, where smuggling would have been a huge earner for many. The price of corn, the staple diet for most of rural North Korea, has reportedly fluctuated enormously and at times a kilogram of corn has cost more than a month's wages. Lina Yoon, a researcher from Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a recent report,externalciting unnamed contacts in the country that ""there is barely any food going into the country from China"". ""There are so many more beggars, some people died from hunger in the border area, and there's no soap, toothpaste, or batteries,"" she wrote. What's it like to live in North Korea? Russians leave North Korea on hand-pushed trolley The UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, TomÃ¡s Ojea Quintana,warned last month in a report of a ""serious food crisis"",externalalready leading to malnourishment and starvation. ""Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them."" It is unclear whether any aid at all is currently coming into the country. North Korea has rejected offers of external aid and almost all diplomats and aid workers, including staff of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), have left. Meanwhile North Korea's border closures means trade with China dropped by 80% last year from levels that had already fallen significantly in 2018 when the UN expanded sanctions over North Korea's nuclear programme. Reports suggest North Korea restricted imports of staple foods from China last August and then cut almost all trade, including food and medicines, in October. The country has also ramped up punishments for smuggling, describing it as ""anti-socialist"" and ""enemy"" behaviour, according to HRW. North Korea was also hit by two major storms last summer, which caused flooding that is believed to have damaged crops, exacerbating the shortages. Kim Jong-un is shoring up support within his party as times get tough. He's making sure that the warnings are coming from him - perhaps so that when things get worse, he can point the finger at his officials for not acting on his orders. He can also pin blame for the dire economy on the Covid-19 pandemic and the strict economic sanctions designed to curb his nuclear weapons programme. And yet his regime continues to design and test new missiles. The weapons tests are something we can all see on satellite images and state media photos, and use them to question world leaders about how they are going to act. The North Korean people cannot get images of their suffering to us without the risk of being imprisoned or shot. Unseen, and according to warnings by their own leader, they now face going hungry amid a looming humanitarian crisis. Tightly controlled by the government, North Korea's economy is one of the least free in the world and is said to be highly inefficient. The enormous cost of maintaining the military and security structures has left very little for the ordinary North Korean. The almost complete border closure aims to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in a country that does not have the public health infrastructure to handle an outbreak. However there are indications that Pyongyang is feeling pressure to reopen borders at least a bit, Mr Zwirko said. ""North Korea has shown signs of wanting to increase trade with China again. They have passed a law a few months ago to help facilitate border trade,"" he said. ""But fundamentally, North Korea remains extremely paranoid about the virus. They'd really have to change and trust in the ability to disinfect goods that would come through."" North Korea claims that so far the border shutdown has kept it Covid-free, though analysts doubt this claim.

A row over lobbying erupted after it came to light the former Conservative PM had sent texts to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and two other ministers appealing for help for Greensill Capital. As reported in theFinancial Times,external, a friend of Mr Cameron said he now thinks a formal letter would have been better. Mr Cameron has yet to respond himself. On Thursday, the chancellorpublished two of his text replies to Mr Cameron, saying the request he had made would ""require a change"" to the system in place - but that he had ""pushed the team to explore an alternative"". A source close to Mr Sunak said the former prime minister had messaged the chancellor ""multiple times"" on his personal phone, and that he had chosen to publish the messages ""in order to reassure beyond doubt that there was no wrongdoing and that he acted with integrity and propriety"". Mr Cameron's texts have not been published. But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the messages ""raise very serious questions about whether the chancellor may have broken the ministerial code"" as they suggested the firm ""got accelerated treatment and access to officials"". The party has called for a ""full, transparent and thorough investigation"", while the SNP has demanded Mr Sunak make a statement to Parliament. Sunak texts to Cameron released in lobbying row David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog After leaving office, Mr Cameron got a job as an adviser to Greensill Capital. The company - which has now gone bust - was run by financier Lex Greensill, who worked as unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron during his time in No 10. When working for Greensill in 2020, Mr Cameron texted Conservative ministers within the Treasury to appeal for access to emergency government-backed loans amidst the height of the pandemic. But the requests were eventually rejected by Treasury officials. Mr Cameron was investigated by a watchdog over whether he broke rules by not registering as a lobbyist for his work at Greensill -but he was cleared in March. But critics have continued to question his access to ministers - and Labour has raised questions about the access Mr Greensill had when he worked as a government adviser. However, the friend of Mr Cameron said he and Mr Greensill met twice at most when Mr Cameron was PM. In the latest development in the row, a friend of Mr Cameron's said he now believed it may have been better to formally approach the chancellor through a letter, rather than sending text messages to his personal phone. The friend said Mr Cameron approached Mr Sunak at a time of national crisis - when the Treasury was actively seeking ideas. And they said that no rules had been broken by the former prime minister. Mr Greensill, the Australian founder of Greensill Capital, has yet to comment on the row.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""We remember the duke... above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty the Queen"" Politicians across the UK were united in mourning after the announcement of the Duke of Edinburgh's death, aged 99. Boris Johnson led the tributes from the steps of Downing Street, praising Prince Philip's ""extraordinary life"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK had ""lost an extraordinary public servant"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sent her condolences to the Royal Family. Parties have suspended their election campaigning as a mark of respect. Elections are due to take place for the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, English councils, city mayors and police and crime commissioners on Thursday, 6 May. Duke of Edinburgh dies aged 99, palace says Live: Tributes paid to Prince Philip Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Earlier, cabinet ministers met to pay tribute to the duke, who had known 16 prime ministers during his time by the Queen's side. A statement released after the virtual meeting said they had ""shared recollections of meeting Prince Philip and praised his work, including as an environmentalist and for the Duke of Edinburgh's Award"". Parliament will return a day early from recess on Monday so MPs can share their condolences in the Commons - led by the prime minister and Sir Keir. Peers - who were due to return to the House of Lords on Monday - will also start their proceedings with a humble address of condolence to the Queen. The Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Welsh Senedd will also be recalled on Monday for tributes. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told the BBC Prince Philip was a ""magnificent man"" and an ""institution"". In a statement, he added: ""Today we must pause to honour him and to offer our sincerest thanks for the prince's devout faithfulness to our country - and all the nations shall miss him greatly."" The death of Prince Philip, who was married to the Queen for more than 70 years, was announced by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The statement said he had ""passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle"". The government has issued guidance for all official flags on all UK government buildings, including the union jack, to be flown at half-mast in tribute to the duke until 08:00 BST on the day following his funeral. Giving a speech outside No 10, Mr Johnson said the duke had ""earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth and around the world"". The prime minister praised Prince Philip's service and ""bravery"" in World War Two, as well as his contributions after - from being a ""champion of the natural world"" through to having ""shaped and inspired the lives of countless young people"" through the Duke of Edinburgh award. ""We remember the duke for all of this and above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty the Queen,"" he added. ""We offer our condolences to her and to all her family and we give thanks, as a nation and a kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip."" The union jack flying over the Houses of Parliament was lowered to half-mast on Friday as a mark of respect Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Duke of Edinburgh had ""dedicated his life to our country"", but he would be ""remembered most of all for his extraordinary commitment and devotion to the Queen"". In a statement, Sir Keir said it had been ""a partnership that inspired millions in Britain and beyond"". He added: ""Their marriage has been a symbol of strength, stability and hope, even as the world around them changed - most recently during the pandemic. ""My thoughts are with the Queen, the Royal Family and the British people as our nation comes together to mourn and remember the life of Prince Philip."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""The UK has lost an extraordinary public servant in Prince Philip"" Other political leaders also paid their respects to the duke - including the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, who said she was ""saddened by the news"".

Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster offered her ""deepest sympathies"" to the Royal Family, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill extended her ""sincere condolences"". Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Prince Philip had ""served the crown with selfless devotion and will be sorely missed by the people of Wales and the many organisations he supported"". The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said the duke was ""a much-loved husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather"", adding: ""We will always be grateful for his amazing service."" Former leaders also expressed their sadness at the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Theresa May, who stood down as prime minister in 2019, said her ""thoughts and prayers"" were with the Queen and her family. She told the BBC that Prince Philip had ""a dry sense of humour"" and was ""a man of so many different interests"", adding: ""I will remember him... as somebody who put those talents to the committed and selfless service of the Queen and her country."" Her predecessor and fellow Conservative, David Cameron, called it ""desperately sad news"", adding: ""It was an honour and a privilege as prime minister to see up close what a powerful advocate the duke was for the causes he believed in."" Prince Philip met many prime ministers in his time - pictured here with David Cameron and Theresa May in 2014 Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was ""personally fortunate to benefit from the duke's wisdom on many occasions"", adding that his ""commitment to the United Kingdom and to the Commonwealth will never be forgotten"". And his predecessor in No 10, former Labour PM Tony Blair, said Prince Philip was ""a man of foresight, determination and courage"" who was ""often way ahead of his time"", on issues such as the environment and ""reconciliation between religious faiths"". Former Conservative PM Sir John Major also released a statement, saying: ""Modest to the core, and hating any kind of fuss or bother, [Prince Philip] epitomised the British spirit and remained true to himself right up to the very end.""

"Amazon has fiercely opposed efforts by the RWDSU to unionise workers at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama Amazon appears likely to be headed to victory over activists hoping to establish the company's first unionised warehouse in the US. Votes against the effort held a more than 2 to 1 lead, in an early tally of almost half the ballots on Thursday. The National Labor Relations Board will continue the count on Friday. The contest is seen as a key test for the e-commerce giant, which has faced global criticism for its treatment of workers during the pandemic. Last month, US President Joe Biden called the vote by workers at the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama a ""vitally important choice"". Celebrities and national Democratic politicians have travelled to the state to support the union campaign, which even drew some Republican backing. A total of 3,125 ballots were cast in the election, according to the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which was behind the unionisation effort. That was a higher turnout than organisers had anticipated, representing just over half of the nearly 6,000 people employed at the warehouse. Hundreds of the votes were challenged by Amazon and union representatives, but an incomplete count of uncontested ballots conducted by labour officials on Thursday showed that at least 1,100 workers voted against the union effort, compared to less than 500 votes in favour of unionising. Amazon has a reputation as a demanding employer RWDSU leaders had hoped that a victory would set a new standard for the firm's hundreds of thousands of workers across the country. If successful, the union drive would mean Amazon, the second largest employer in the US, would have to negotiate a contract with union officials on issues such as work rules and pay. But analysts had warned that the union faced an uphill battle in the election. Amazon worker fight: 'You're a cog in the system' Amazon 'illegally retaliated' against climate activists Union membership has steadily dwindled in America in recent decades - just6% of private sector workers,externalbelonged to a trade union in 2020. Suspicion of organised labour runs especially deep in conservative states like Alabama. In Bessemer, a city with a population of 27,000 outside Birmingham, the opening of the Amazon plant last year was hailed as a welcome jobs creator, for a town hit hard by the closure of manufacturing plants in the 1980s. The union fight in Bessemer has drawn national attention from politicians such as Senator Bernie Sanders Amazon had also fiercely opposed the unionisation drive. At mandatory staff meetings, in text messages and online, the e-commerce giant argued that it offered competitive pay and benefits. It said the union would charge members hundreds of dollars in dues, without being able to make meaningful change. In a statement on Thursday, RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said the union would call on the labour board ""to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behaviour during the campaign"". ""Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that,"" he said. ""But make no mistake about it - this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard."" In media interviews prior to the vote, pro-union workers had said the company frequently denied staff breaks, changed schedules unexpectedly and intrusively monitored their activities. Union organisers had also tied the fight at the warehouse - where the majority of workers are black - to broader issues of civil rights and racial justice.

"Prince Philip's close association with Scotland started in his school days and lasted more than 80 years. According to his headmaster's report, the prince was universally trusted and liked at Gordonstoun school in the north east of Scotland. The future Duke of Edinburgh attended the boarding school in Moray until 1939. In the early 1930s, Prince Philip of Greece, as he then was, had attended Salem School in Germany. It was founded by Dr Kurt Hahn, a German Jew who was a famous educational innovator. The school focused on military discipline and physical education, as well as academia. However, Dr Hahn fled Germany after he was arrested for speaking out against Hitler. He established Gordonstoun as the British version of Salem - and Prince Philip followed him there two terms later. Prince Philip in costume for a production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun in July 1935 ""The school played an enormous part in both his early life, and also his way of life,"" said James Thomas, from Gordonstoun. ""His enthusiasm for the school came through. When he came through Gordonstoun's gates, people generally said he had a spring in his step and he was delighted to get back and visit old haunts. ""He was always entirely relaxed whenever he came."" Prince Philip loved his time at Gordonstoun. He excelled at sport, captaining the hockey and cricket teams, and also served as head of school. In fact, he found the regime so invigorating that he later sent his three sons - although Prince Charles did not share his father's enthusiasm for the austere establishment, describing it as ""absolute hell"". A young Prince Charles arrives for his first term at Gordonstoun school in 1962, accompanied by his father Prince Philip (left) and Captain Iain Tennant of the school's board of governors Prince Philip became the Duke of Edinburgh on the eve of his wedding to Princess Elizabeth, on 20 November 1947. It is a title which had been conferred upon members of the British royal family only four times since its creation in 1726. The future Queen Elizabeth was known as the Duchess of Edinburgh until she became queen in 1952. The Balmoral estate in Royal Deeside provided a haven for the Queen and her consort through the decades, and the family holidayed there every summer. The Queen is said to have described it as ""my dear paradise in the Highlands"". Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in a field with some Highland cattle at Balmoral in 1972 In 1956, not long after the royal couple married, Prince Philip launched the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, inspired by the Moray Badge which he had worked for while a pupil at Gordonstoun. Dr Hahn had started the scheme, aimed at giving post-war youngsters in Britain a sense of achievement, and he approached one of his first and most famous Gordonstoun pupils for help in rolling it out across the country. Together he and Prince Philip drew up an outline of what would become the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which more than four million people from some 60 countries have taken part in since its inception. Janet Shepherd, the former head of the award scheme in Scotland, said the Prince's presentations to thousands of Scottish youngsters were an annual ritual at the Palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh. ""I would often spend the whole day with him,"" she said. This video can not be played The Duke of Edinburghâs enduring connection with Scotland ""You always were a bit nervous on the day, no matter how many times you did it. But he soon put you at ease. I never found him difficult or awkward. ""He was always very interested in what the young people were doing. There was always laughter and a tremendous warmth."" Prince Philip had a close involvement with the city whose title he bears. He spent 57 years as Chancellor of Edinburgh University, a role he only retired from in 2010. The university's former principal, Prof Timothy O'Shea, said the prince was an unforgettable character who made a tremendous contribution. ""He was very actively involved in the university,"" he said. ""He presided at special graduation ceremonies, he would help me induct the new professors, he came along for senior staff getting long service awards. He even came to the installation of the rector by the students."" Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip watch competitors at the Braemar Gathering in 2003 Prof O'Shea said Prince Philip liked ""a certain amount of student wildness"". ""He was reminiscing with me about riotous installations of the rector, with students throwing flour and doing all sorts of things,"" he recalled. ""He asked me when the next one was and I said I would let him know. The administration and other colleagues said you mustn't tell him, but I felt honour-bound to. ""He immediately, despite attempts from the Special Branch, insisted he came along for some uproar. ""In the event it was quite mild. And he remonstrated with me afterwards, that I'd made it too orderly."" The Queen and the prince at the Order of the Thistle ceremony at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh in 2006 Prof O'Shea said the prince was very straight-talking, humorous and would often tease him. It was a trait for which he was well known, having famously asked a driving instructor in Oban how he ""managed to keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test"". The principal said he would be greatly missed by the university community and by the city as a whole. ""When I started he explained to me that he'd been the chancellor for more than 50 years and if I had any problems I should tell him. ""He was a part of the city's life in the way the Lord Provost is part of the city's life. ""He was very jolly - meals with the chancellor were always great fun. He was a visible, positive presence.""

Usually they went smoothly but one, which produced a ""human moment"", was derailed by a swarm of bees. Photographer Chris Young, working for the Press Association at the time, was there to capture it on camera. As colonel of the regiment, the duke was standing in full uniform, as he prepared to accompany Her Majesty when she emerged. But it was at this point that Young became aware of the bees. ""I got lucky,"" says Young, recalling the event 18 years later. ""I recognised that it was a human moment. She was giggling like a little girl and he was laughing too. ""I thought the reaction from both of them was pretty unique. ""Some of the guests were unsure as to whether they should move, but eventually everyone had to beat a retreat."" A royal beekeeper was swiftly summoned to sort things out. Read the story of that picturehere. Election campaigning will resume on Tuesday after a pause following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, councils, police and crime commissioners, and mayoral races in England are being held on 6 May. Campaigning will resume a day after tributes are paid to Prince Philip on Monday in the House of Commons, Holyrood and the Senedd. It will pause again on Saturday, the day of the duke's funeral. Read morehere. The Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will be a family affair attended by close relatives, with a guest list limited to just 30 because of ongoing coronavirus restrictions in England. The Queen and Prince Philip's children and grandchildren will gather to pay their respects. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be present, to allow for as many family members as possible to be there under Covid-19 rules, Downing Street has said. The duke's long-standing close aide, his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, will be one of the few, and possibly only, non-royals invited to attend the historic occasion inside St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday. Brigadier Miller-Bakewell has been the duke's right hand man for 11 years, taking on the role in 2010. Read more about the funeral planshere. The Duke of Edinburgh's first experience of the Royal Navy was as an 18-month old exile after the Greek military government banished his family. Years after that evacuation, as he left his Scottish boarding school, Prince Philip expressed a wish to join the Royal Air Force. He was persuaded by his uncle to consider joining the navy and began his budding career. Philip served with distinction during World War Two and was mentioned in dispatches Despite his career
being cut short by his royal duties, Prince Philip is remembered as an immensely
capable officer who drove himself as hard as his men and remained cool in moments
of crisis. He maintained
his love of ships and the sea, which remained a constant source of fascination
to him. ""You're
at sea and exposed to the elements in a way you never are ashore. ""At sea
you're in a cockleshell in this enormous expanse of the ocean. ""So that
tends to cut you down in size a bit."" Read morehere. Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 When remembering Prince Philip, it is easy to forget that he
endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, historian Philip Eade has told the
BBC. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder
sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home
as his immediate family. His mother, Princess Alice of
Battenberg, was placed into a sanatorium. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first
two years of her confinement and for five years between the summer of 1932 and
the spring of 1937, he never saw or heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this.
""I just had to get on with it,"" he later told one biographer. Read more
here The opening night of the virutal Bafta film awards has begun with a tribute paid to the Duke of Edinburgh. Host Clara Amfo praises the work of Prince Philip - a former Bafta president. ""Before we start tonight we want to say that on behalf of Bafta we are extremely saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday,"" she says. ""The duke was Bafta's very first president over 60 years ago and was the first of a line of royal patronage all the way through to Bafta's current president, his grandson, the Duke of Cambridge. ""It was Prince Philip and Her Majesty the Queen's support throughout these years that in many ways allowed Bafta, a leading charity in the arts, to continue in difficult times and to be here today in 2021 celebrating another outstanding year of achievement in film."" As the Queen comes to terms with the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, people in Windsor tell us what they'd say to Her Majesty if they had the chance. This video can not be played Prince Philip: What would you say to the Queen today? Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth says the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death in part reflects ""people's affection for the Queen"" and the realisation that she is alone. ""She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone, so it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss,"" he said. He adds: ""But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by."" He says he thinks people have also stopped to think that Prince Philip ""always did what he was asked to do"". ""He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years,"" he says.

had a close friendship with the royal family in Jaipur in the state of
Rajasthan. The Maharaja of Jaipur, His
Highness, Sawai Padmanabh Singh, says he is saddened by the passing of the
Duke of Edinburgh. ""This is truly the end of an era,"" he says.  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh ""The Royal House of Jaipur has been close to the Royal Family of Britain for generations. One of my ancestors, the late Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II of Jaipur, was among the few princes from India invited to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902,"" he writes. The Queen and Prince Philip continued the friendship through the generations and were close to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his third wifeMaharani Gayatri Devi- a glamorous royal couple, described as India's answer to John and Jackie Kennedy - visiting them all on their trips to India. âWhen Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a State visit to India in 1961, they asked to include Jaipur on their itinerary because of their personal equation.â So warm was the friendship, Maharani Gayatri Devi sent the duke a box of alfonso mangoes for his birthday every year, those close to the family have said. The close ties between the two families extended to the polo ground too: âHRH Prince Philip was a talented polo player, who has played on the Rambagh Polo Ground of Jaipur, just as our family has in England each summer."" The Maharani presented Prince Philip with the trophy when his polo team Windsor Park won the Victoria Cup in 1960 Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The writer Walter Bagehot, in 1867, wrote about the ""dignified"" bit of the state, and the ""efficient"" part. Monarchy and government, in other words. The death of one of the most senior members of the former leads to a pause in the public actions of the latter, and opposition parties. The cacophony of politics has quietened, for now, at just the point it was getting louder. There are elections next month to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elections for mayors, councils and police and crime commissioners in England. But campaigning was suspended yesterday. Tonight, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, has said the Tories will resume campaigning on Tuesday morning, but pause again next Saturday, the day of the Duke's funeral. A Labour source tells me they are likely to adopt a similar approach. The Liberal Democrats say they are likely to restart their campaigning at some point on Monday. Other parties are likely to follow a broadly similar plan. World leaders including US President Joe Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Biden called the duke ""a heck of a guy"", while Ms Ardern highlighted his awards scheme. See more tributes here: This video can not be played Sarah CampbellRoyal Correspondent In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best. As one private secretary once put it: ""Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can."" It was a marriage based on love. They chose one another. Although it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. He was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. What started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room. Their grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: ""He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.""

following confirmation the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor
Castle that afternoon. A national minute's silence will be observed as the ceremonial royal funeral
begins at 15:00 BST. The funeral will take place on a busy sporting weekend with the FA Cup
semi-finals, a full Football League programme, the Women's Six Nations rugby and the
opening day of the World Snooker Championship among the events on the calendar. The Football League has announcedmatches scheduled to begin at 15:00 will be rearranged""as a mark of respect"". The government says it is up to the discretion of organisers as to whether sport fixtures are rearranged. In Scotland, Rangers are due to host Celtic at 16:00, one of six fourth-round
ties scheduled in the Scottish Cup, with the Scottish Football Association saying it hasentered dialogue with the relevant stakeholders about the matches. Queen Rania of Jordan has shared her thoughts about what life as a royal consort is like. She describes the Duke of Edinburgh as
a âconstant anchorâ for the Queen and says the Queen might not have been able
to âcarry on her journey the way she did without him by her sideâ. Queen Rania married her husband, now King Abdullah of Jordan, in 1993 and he became king in 1999. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview
with ITV News, she says the role of a consort is âdefined as you go along, based
on how and where you can make a difference, where you are needed and where your
passions lieâ. âBeing married to someone who is under so much pressure
means you have to do whatever you can to try and alleviate some of that
pressure. Even if thatâs by being a distraction,â she says. ""The wellbeing of your spouse eventually has an impact on how well they can carry out their duties."" Queen Rania adds there ""must have been times when it wasn't easy for him"". People around the UK have been finding a way to mark the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Outside Buckingham Palace, a steady stream of people have been queuing to leave flowers. In Windsor, hundreds of people have left bunches of flowers outside the castle. A smaller number has been left outside Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And drivers of the iconic London black cab have lined up on The Mall, the road which leads to Buckingham Palace. The UK government has urged the public not to gather because of the pandemic, while the Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of flowers, and is encouraging the public to use an online book of condolence. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Downing Street has announced the Prime Minister will not attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral next Saturday - as we reported a few minutes ago. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman says: âThe
Prime Minister has throughout wanted to act in accordance with what is best for
the Royal household, and so to allow for as many family members as possible
will not be attending the funeral on Saturdayâ. My understanding is the protocol around this is those who would be expected to attend such a funeral is drawn up well in advance, and in normal times that would include the prime minister. But given the Covid restrictions, Boris Johnson felt it was appropriate to say he wouldn't be there, to allow someone who knew him better the chance to be there.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""A heck of a guy"": US President Joe Biden, NZ PM Jacinda Ardern and other world leaders pay tribute to Prince Philip Monarchs, heads of state and prime ministers across the world have sent heartfelt tributes following the death of Prince Philip at the age of 99. Europe's royal households and Commonwealth leaders alike praised the Duke of Edinburgh's public service. Joe Biden described the duke as a ""heck of a guy"", and all living former US presidents also sent tributes. Meanwhile, commemorative church services and remembrance ceremonies are taking place on Sunday. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison attended a service at Sydney's St Andrews Cathedral which included prayers for the Royal Family and a naval hymn in honour of Prince Philip.. He earlier described the duke as ""a man who was steadfast, who could be relied upon, who always [stood] by his Queen"". Special church services - such as this one in Sydney - are taking place around the world on Sunday ""On Prince Philip's many visits to Australia, we have come to know him as a man of compassion and service, personal warmth, intellectual curiosity and generous spirit,"" Reverend Kanishka de Silva Raffel said at the service. In neighbouring New Zealand, a ceremony took place on Sunday in the country's capital, Wellington, featuring a 41-gun salute. Barack Obama said Philip was a ""remarkable man... who helped provide steady leadership and guiding wisdom"" On Saturday, Pope Francis paid tribute to the duke's ""devotion to his marriage and family"". The leader of the Roman Catholic Church also noted the prince's ""commitment to the education and advancement of future generations"". The spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, wrote to the Queen and Prince Charles, saying Prince Philip would be remembered for having lived a meaningful life. President Xi Jinping of China also sent his condolences. The duke, whose death was announced by Buckingham Palace on Friday, accompanied the Queen during hundreds of overseas visits. Prince Philip had blood ties with a number of former or current European royal households, and many of their members sent condolences. The telegram from King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain was particularly poignant, sending ""all our love and affection"" to Aunt Lilibet (the affectionate name used by the duke for his wife) and Dear Uncle Philip. ""We shall never forget the moments that we shared with him,"" they told the Queen. Prince Philip rides in a carriage with Spain's Queen Letizia in London in 2017 Sweden's King Carl Gustaf said the duke had been ""a great friend of our family for many years, a relation we have deeply valued"". Swedish royal family spokeswoman Margareta Thorgren told the BBC the king and the duke had sailed together in England, adding: ""That was the start of a great friendship between them."" The Dutch royal family said they remembered Prince Philip with great respect, adding: ""His lively personality made an indelible impression."" Belgium's King Philippe said he and Queen Mathilde would ""always cherish the memories of our warm encounters"". Tributes came in too from the Commonwealth - 54 nations, most with roots in the British Empire and home to 2.4 billion people. Australian flags were flown at half-mast on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in tribute to the duke Flags were lowered to half-mast at Australia's Parliament House in Canberra, where a 41-gun salute took place on Saturday, and at the Sydney Harbour Bridge, where in 1954 Prince Philip arrived alongside the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth on the first visit by a reigning monarch to the country. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern noted that thousands of young people had ""completed life-changing challenges"" through the duke's Hillary Award. A 41-gun salute is fired to commemorate the death of Prince Philip at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the duke had ""contributed so much to the social fabric of our country - and the world"". Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said Philip had been a ""wise leader"" and his ""role in promoting Pakistan-UK relations will always be remembered"". And Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was another to praise a lifetime of dedication to ""many community service initiatives"". Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said the duke had been a ""towering symbol of family values and the unity of the British people as well as the entire global community"". African leaders mourn Philip Other warm condolences from Africa included Zimbabwe - which has had a rocky relationship with the UK and is no longer in the Commonwealth - and the president of Tanzania, which only recentlylost its leader John Pombe Magufuli amid Covid-19 rumours. Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Other tributes came from nations deeply linked to the duke and his family. Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela wrote: ""Truly saddened by the loss of Prince Philip, who made Malta his home and returned here so often. Our people will always treasure his memory."" Philip and Elizabeth spent two idyllic years on Malta, where he was stationed in the Navy, before King George VI died in 1952. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the duke had been ""the consummate public servant"" and would be much missed. The duke's mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, who died in 1969, is buried at the Church of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem. The Duke of Edinburgh with his mother Princess Alice Of Battenberg The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, sent his ""sincere condolences and sympathies"" to the Queen, the Royal Family and the British people. In a personal tribute, Barack Obama, one of the 18 US presidents in the duke's lifetime, said Philip had immediately put him and Michelle at ease, and that he was ""kind and warm, with a sharp wit and unfailing good humour"". Donald Trump said Prince Philip,externalhad ""defined British dignity and grace. He personified the quiet reserve, stern fortitude and unbending integrity of the United Kingdom..."" In a telegram to the Queen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the duke had ""rightfully enjoyed respect"" both at home and internationally. And Chancellor Angela Merkel said the duke's ""friendship with Germany, his straightforward nature and his sense of duty"" would be remembered. Gun salutes planned for Prince Philip France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the duke a man of ""great style"", saying: ""France joins in the sorrow of its friends across the Channel and salutes the life of a man who was a witness to a century of trials and hopes for our continent."" Italian President Sergio Mattarella said he would ""cherish"" the memories of Prince Philip's ""deep admiration for Italy's artistic and cultural heritage"". He said the duke had accompanied the"" evolution of his country with an open and innovative spirit"". Irish President Michael D Higgins praised Prince Philip's ability to bring ""an air of informality to otherwise formal occasions"". ""His distinctive presence and unique sense of humour put participants at ease and always engaged those who encountered him,"" he said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed her sympathy to the royal family and ""the people of the United Kingdom on this very sad day"".

"The star plans to re-record all of her first six albums, in an attempt to regain control of her music Most pop stars, if pressed, will tell you they don't listen to their old records. Years later, they can still hear all the imperfections, the missed opportunities, the things they'd have done differently. So when Taylor Swift announced plans to re-record all of her first six albums, starting with 2008's Fearless, it seemed likely that she'd take the opportunity to rewrite history. After all, one of the best tracks on Fearless, the lilting Fifteen, is about going back in time to ""tell yourself what you know now."" But somehow she's resisted that temptation. Fearless (Taylor's Version) is an almost perfect replica of the original, right down to the giggle Swift lets slip in the middle of Hey Stephen. The new recordings are cleaner, perhaps. It's easier to pick out little details like Swift dampening the strings of her guitar on White Horse, or the rattle of the hi-hats on Forever And Always. Most impressively, Swift seems to have regressed her voice to its teenage state. The maturity she discovered on last year's folk-pop masterpieces Folklore and Evermore is gone. In its place is a wide-eyed innocence that the album's giddy recollections of prom dates and first kisses requires. With everything the star has been through in the last 13 years - from failed relationships to public vilification and a career resurrection - it's an impressive feat. It would be fascinating to know how she pulled it off: Was it simply a technical process of studying the original tapes, or did she delve deep into her psyche to find a former version of herself? Either way, it's hard to overstate the complexity of pulling it off. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

One song that does seem to have been tweaked is, appropriately enough, called Change. Leading into the final chorus, Swift corrects her pronunciation of the word ""revolution"" and adds additional harmonies on the closing ""hallelujahs"". It's a subtle tweak, but it gives the song's climax a little more oomph. BeyoncÃ© and Taylor Swift make Grammys history Taylor Swift speaks out after her masters are sold Taylor Swift sells the millionth copy of Folklore Overall, the experience is a bit like hearing Fearless on a brand new pair of headphones. Minor details stand out because your brain is attuned to the novelty of having ""a new thing"". A week from now, the new versions will seem indistinguishable from the originals. And that is the point. Swift's decision to re-make her old music isn't an exercise in vanity, it's about taking back control. The backstory is complicated - but here's a brief overview: Swift's recording career started in 2005, when she signed a 12-year deal with Nashville's Big Machine Recordings. Her first album went seven-times platinum in the US and after switching lanes to pop music on 2012's Red, she became a global superstar in the process. In 2018, she signed a new deal with Universal Records, and Big Machine sold the rights to Swift's first six albums to Scooter Braun - Kanye West's former manager, whomSwift claimed had ""bullied"" her for years. Braun later sold the rights to an investment fund for an estimated $300m, although he reportedly retains a financial interest in the music. Swift was incensed that he would profit from her records, characterising the sale as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". Swift holds Scooter Braun partly responsible for Kanye West's attempts to derail her career She immediately began blocking requests for her old songs to be used in films and TV shows - thwarting one potential source of revenue - and vowed to re-record her back catalogue entirely. In doing so, she regains control of her songs - with the hope that the new versions will ""replace"" the originals on streaming services and download stores. So far, the plan seems to be working. Dedicated Swifties have flocked to the new version of Fearless, sending it to number one on iTunes within hours of its release. They've been enticed by the inclusion of 14 bonus tracks, six of which are previously-unreleased songs from the era. (Among them is the casually-scathing Mr Perfectly Fine, supposedly written about her relationship with Joe Jonas, which the star's wife Sophie Turner has described as ""not NOT a bop""). But once the excitement settles down, will fans stick with the new recordings, or go back to the beloved originals? Swift will undoubtedly be watching to see what happens next. Allow YouTube content?

"Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans. The prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a ""fact of life"" for people travelling internationally in future. The government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. However, the prime minister said he had ""not given up"" on the idea. Under plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. No isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to Â£200 each. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren But earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases. Asked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can. ""The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible."" Mr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government ""wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it. ""If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destinationâ¦ [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities."" 'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Scientists and ministers recently warnedthat holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are ""unlikely"". But Mr Johnson said he ""had not given up"" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly However,other travel industry figures called for clarityfollowing the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing. The Business Travel Association said the announcement was ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". Its chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had ""once again been kicked down the road"". ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,"" he added. The boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down. He said that overall, there were ""glimmers of good news"", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. ""But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April. But Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path. ""Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidaysâ¦ that just won't come this week."" She added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions.

"In public, Prince Philip always took second place He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him. And so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company. With his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man. His mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. His four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding. When peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the ""white heat of the technological revolution"", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable. Eighteen months after his birth, his family was in exile His childhood quickly taught him the values of self-reliance He was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, ""the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,"" as his sister Sophia later described it. In Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him. ""I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,"" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links. By the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea. Philip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. Prince Philip became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy But he had to give up his career to support the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children would not bear his name, Mountbatten That ethos became a significant, perhapsthesignificant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. ""The essence of freedom,"" he would say in Ghana in 1958, ""is discipline and self-control."" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important ""but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living"". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the ""importance of the individual"" as the ""guiding principle of our society"". And at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. And yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last? The navy ran deep in the Duke of Edinburgh's family. He is pictured sitting at the wheel of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Churchill Prince Philip gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests At Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. The navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, ""Dickie"" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. ""Prince Philip"", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, ""will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength"". Others had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  ""If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,"" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. ""One of his crew,"" writes another biographer, ""said he would rather die than serve under him again."" In Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. ""It is an extraordinary master or mistress,"" he would say later, ""it has such extraordinary moods.""  But a rival to the sea would come. When King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip. Prince Philip with his uncle, Earl Mountbatten, at the Royal Marines Barracks in 1965 The Queen, with one of the Royal corgis, chats with polo-playing Prince Philip at Windsor Great Park Their engagement was announced in July 1947 Did he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end. He knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, ""as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him"". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably. For someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. ""There's never been 'if only',"" he said once, ""except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy"". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, ""I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it."" That moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, ""It takes a man to have a boy."" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen. He would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her ""liege man of life and limb"". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,"" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband. Prince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. ""Within the house,"" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, ""I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably."" Prince Philip had hundreds of patronages and projects with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport Prince Philip helped sustain the monarchy The transition to life in the Palace was brutal. ""Philip,"" said his equerry, ""was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers."" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was ""difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive"". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany. In response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s. At home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. Within the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. ""He believes he has a creative mission,"" wrote an early biographer, ""to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society."" He was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment. In his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a ""splendid gadget"" that he called ""a miniature word processor"".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. Out of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. ""A lot of time and energy,"" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, ""has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already."" Reflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (""it seems to me..."") garnered from his extensive travels. Despite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of ""urban dwellers"" and of the ""average citizen"" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - ""The enterprise is doomed,"" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, ""if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory."" He was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the ""greedy and senseless exploitation of nature."" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, ""a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" which he referred to as the ""greenhouse effect"". His relationship with his eldest son improved in later years And he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: ""I have very little experience of self-government,"" he told one audience, ""I am one of the most governed people you could meet...."" His example of irrational behaviour? - ""making and listening to speeches on important occasions"". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - ""I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions."" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. It is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his ""gaffes"", off-colour comments and salty jokes. That he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. There was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did. Looking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say ""I don't know why you are bothering"". He once said of his son Charles: ""He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling."" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. And the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. ""Life,"" wrote one biographer, ""hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick."" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. ""What the royal family offers you is friendliness,"" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, ""not friendship."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London Major General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he ""asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine"". It was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. Because of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. ""A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,"" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, ""needs a loose fit portrait."" He was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? ""Absolutely, absolutely,"" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other ""followers"", with trademark modesty. ""Our only distinction,"" he said, ""was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it."" The Royal family Â© 2025 BBC.

"The star plans to re-record all of her first six albums, in an attempt to regain control of her music Most pop stars, if pressed, will tell you they don't listen to their old records. Years later, they can still hear all the imperfections, the missed opportunities, the things they'd have done differently. So when Taylor Swift announced plans to re-record all of her first six albums, starting with 2008's Fearless, it seemed likely that she'd take the opportunity to rewrite history. After all, one of the best tracks on Fearless, the lilting Fifteen, is about going back in time to ""tell yourself what you know now."" But somehow she's resisted that temptation. Fearless (Taylor's Version) is an almost perfect replica of the original, right down to the giggle Swift lets slip in the middle of Hey Stephen. The new recordings are cleaner, perhaps. It's easier to pick out little details like Swift dampening the strings of her guitar on White Horse, or the rattle of the hi-hats on Forever And Always. Most impressively, Swift seems to have regressed her voice to its teenage state. The maturity she discovered on last year's folk-pop masterpieces Folklore and Evermore is gone. In its place is a wide-eyed innocence that the album's giddy recollections of prom dates and first kisses requires. With everything the star has been through in the last 13 years - from failed relationships to public vilification and a career resurrection - it's an impressive feat. It would be fascinating to know how she pulled it off: Was it simply a technical process of studying the original tapes, or did she delve deep into her psyche to find a former version of herself? Either way, it's hard to overstate the complexity of pulling it off. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

One song that does seem to have been tweaked is, appropriately enough, called Change. Leading into the final chorus, Swift corrects her pronunciation of the word ""revolution"" and adds additional harmonies on the closing ""hallelujahs"". It's a subtle tweak, but it gives the song's climax a little more oomph. BeyoncÃ© and Taylor Swift make Grammys history Taylor Swift speaks out after her masters are sold Taylor Swift sells the millionth copy of Folklore Overall, the experience is a bit like hearing Fearless on a brand new pair of headphones. Minor details stand out because your brain is attuned to the novelty of having ""a new thing"". A week from now, the new versions will seem indistinguishable from the originals. And that is the point. Swift's decision to re-make her old music isn't an exercise in vanity, it's about taking back control. The backstory is complicated - but here's a brief overview: Swift's recording career started in 2005, when she signed a 12-year deal with Nashville's Big Machine Recordings. Her first album went seven-times platinum in the US and after switching lanes to pop music on 2012's Red, she became a global superstar in the process. In 2018, she signed a new deal with Universal Records, and Big Machine sold the rights to Swift's first six albums to Scooter Braun - Kanye West's former manager, whomSwift claimed had ""bullied"" her for years. Braun later sold the rights to an investment fund for an estimated $300m, although he reportedly retains a financial interest in the music. Swift was incensed that he would profit from her records, characterising the sale as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". Swift holds Scooter Braun partly responsible for Kanye West's attempts to derail her career She immediately began blocking requests for her old songs to be used in films and TV shows - thwarting one potential source of revenue - and vowed to re-record her back catalogue entirely. In doing so, she regains control of her songs - with the hope that the new versions will ""replace"" the originals on streaming services and download stores. So far, the plan seems to be working. Dedicated Swifties have flocked to the new version of Fearless, sending it to number one on iTunes within hours of its release. They've been enticed by the inclusion of 14 bonus tracks, six of which are previously-unreleased songs from the era. (Among them is the casually-scathing Mr Perfectly Fine, supposedly written about her relationship with Joe Jonas, which the star's wife Sophie Turner has described as ""not NOT a bop""). But once the excitement settles down, will fans stick with the new recordings, or go back to the beloved originals? Swift will undoubtedly be watching to see what happens next. Allow YouTube content?

"The Duke of Edinburgh was born in the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921. His family tree includes members of the royal families of Denmark, Germany, Russia and Britain. Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. The prince began his education in France at the MacJannet American school in St-Cloud and is seen here (second from left) with his schoolmates. At the age of seven he went to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. Later he attended Gordonstoun boarding school, founded by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn in northern Scotland, where he excelled at sport. This is believed to be the first time Princess Elizabeth (third from left) and the then naval cadet Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark (in the white cap on the far right) were pictured together. It was taken during a visit to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth on 23 July 1939. During World War Two, Prince Philip saw action as a midshipman on the battleship HMS Valiant. When the Italian fleet was trapped off Greece in 1941, Philip commanded the searchlights that illuminated the enemy and he was later mentioned in dispatches. His engagement to Princess Elizabeth was officially announced in July 1947. They married on 20 November that year. In 1951 a photographer caught the moment the Duke of Edinburgh jumped off his water skis as he reached the beach at Marmaris in Turkey. It was taken during his last posting as commander of HMS Magpie. The prince is seen here playing polo for Cowdray Park in the semi-finals of the Roehampton Cup. He was one of the leading polo players in Britain. The duke was also a keen cricketer. Here his team, made up of former England stars, were pitted against one captained by the Duke of Norfolk, with Sussex players. The duke and Queen had four children, (from left) Edward, Andrew, Anne and Charles, pictured here in the 1960s. The couple are seen here during a visit to a farm on their Balmoral estate, to celebrate their Silver Wedding anniversary. In 1977 the prince accompanied the Queen as she celebrated her Silver Jubilee. They are seen here both wearing Maori Kahu-Kiwi (Kiwi feather cloaks) at Rugby Park in Gisborne, on the North Island of New Zealand when they attended the opening of the Royal New Zealand Polynesian Festival in February. Later that year the royal couple waved as Concorde flew past the Royal Yacht Britannia as they neared Barbados. In August 1979 the Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA bomb blast on his boat in Ireland. The Duke of Edinburgh returned to the UK after hearing the news, having taken part in a coach-driving championship in Normandy, northern France. Nature and conservation were lifelong passions of the Duke of Edinburgh and he seemed a natural choice to become the international president of what was then the World Wildlife Fund. In 1985 the Duke of Edinburgh was surrounded by his family, including the young princes William and Harry, as they gathered to watch a flypast over Buckingham Palace after Trooping the Colour. In 1996 the duke escorted the South African President Nelson Mandela as he prepared to review an honour guard in Horse Guards Parade on the first day of his state visit to Britain. Prince Philip supported the Queen through more than 60 years of her reign, including the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. The prince set up the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, which is aimed at developing young people's abilities, in 1956. Here he shares a joke with Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holders at Holyroodhouse in 2010. The duke continued to compete in sport late in his life, including this carriage-driving event at Sandringham in 2005. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace to greet the Royal Family after the wedding of Prince Philip's grandson, Prince William, to Catherine Middleton in 2011. Twelve months later, the prince had appeared to be in good health when he accompanied the Queen on the royal barge, the Spirit of Chartwell, which formed part of the rain-drenched Diamond Jubilee river pageant on 3 June 2012. He and the Queen stood for most of the 80-minute journey, as they were accompanied by 1,000 boats travelling seven miles down the River Thames to Tower Bridge. However, the duke was admitted to hospital with a bladder infection before the Diamond Jubilee concert on 4 June. After making a recovery, he was fit enough to accompany Princess Anne to watch Great Britain's equestrian team, which included his granddaughter Zara Phillips, compete in the eventing at the 2012 London Olympics. In June 2013 the duke attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation. In 2014 he accompanied the Queen on a tour of Northern Ireland. He is pictured here signing the visitors book at Hillsborough Castle, Belfast. Queen Elizabeth II accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh lit the first of more than 200 beacons to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE Day at Windsor Castle. The duke and his son Charles shared a funny moment together during a visit to Poundbury, an urban development on the edge of Dorchester, where the Queen unveiled a statue of the Queen Mother. In April 2017 the duke accompanied his wife to open a new Centre for Elephant Care at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. In May however he announced he was to stand down from public engagements at the age of 95, with the full support of the Queen. Alongside the Queen the duke observed a minute's silence at the start of a garden party at Buckingham Palace on 23 May 2017 in tribute to those killed at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The duke has been the longest-serving royal consort in British history.

"Amazon has fiercely opposed efforts by the RWDSU to unionise workers at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama Amazon appears likely to be headed to victory over activists hoping to establish the company's first unionised warehouse in the US. Votes against the effort held a more than 2 to 1 lead, in an early tally of almost half the ballots on Thursday. The National Labor Relations Board will continue the count on Friday. The contest is seen as a key test for the e-commerce giant, which has faced global criticism for its treatment of workers during the pandemic. Last month, US President Joe Biden called the vote by workers at the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama a ""vitally important choice"". Celebrities and national Democratic politicians have travelled to the state to support the union campaign, which even drew some Republican backing. A total of 3,125 ballots were cast in the election, according to the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which was behind the unionisation effort. That was a higher turnout than organisers had anticipated, representing just over half of the nearly 6,000 people employed at the warehouse. Hundreds of the votes were challenged by Amazon and union representatives, but an incomplete count of uncontested ballots conducted by labour officials on Thursday showed that at least 1,100 workers voted against the union effort, compared to less than 500 votes in favour of unionising. Amazon has a reputation as a demanding employer RWDSU leaders had hoped that a victory would set a new standard for the firm's hundreds of thousands of workers across the country. If successful, the union drive would mean Amazon, the second largest employer in the US, would have to negotiate a contract with union officials on issues such as work rules and pay. But analysts had warned that the union faced an uphill battle in the election. Amazon worker fight: 'You're a cog in the system' Amazon 'illegally retaliated' against climate activists Union membership has steadily dwindled in America in recent decades - just6% of private sector workers,externalbelonged to a trade union in 2020. Suspicion of organised labour runs especially deep in conservative states like Alabama. In Bessemer, a city with a population of 27,000 outside Birmingham, the opening of the Amazon plant last year was hailed as a welcome jobs creator, for a town hit hard by the closure of manufacturing plants in the 1980s. The union fight in Bessemer has drawn national attention from politicians such as Senator Bernie Sanders Amazon had also fiercely opposed the unionisation drive. At mandatory staff meetings, in text messages and online, the e-commerce giant argued that it offered competitive pay and benefits. It said the union would charge members hundreds of dollars in dues, without being able to make meaningful change. In a statement on Thursday, RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said the union would call on the labour board ""to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behaviour during the campaign"". ""Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that,"" he said. ""But make no mistake about it - this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard."" In media interviews prior to the vote, pro-union workers had said the company frequently denied staff breaks, changed schedules unexpectedly and intrusively monitored their activities. Union organisers had also tied the fight at the warehouse - where the majority of workers are black - to broader issues of civil rights and racial justice.

"The UK government gives more detail on its traffic light system for the resumption of overseas travel from England Travellers will need to pay for tests when departing and returning from abroad, including at least one PCR test Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the cost of Covid tests needs to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel sector Shapps also says he's not advising against people in England booking summer trips abroad It's still too early to say whether foreign holidays can resume on 17 May, he says, or which countries will be deemed to be safe Twice-weekly free rapid coronavirus tests are available to everyone in England from today Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab Brazil records more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant circulates Edited by Holly Wallis ITV presenter Kate Garraway's husband has returned home after more than a year in hospital being treated for Covid-19. Former political adviser Derek Draper, 53, was admitted in March last year with coronavirus symptoms, before having to be put into a coma. Garraway says he ""absolutely knew he was home"" but has not yet regained his speech and will require round-the-clock care. She and her young family all ""burst into tears"" when he arrived home. ""As we pulled up, I could see two little faces, Darcey and Billy [their children] looking out the window, and I could literally see them go, 'he's here,'"" she tells her Good Morning Britain colleagues. ""And they sort of ran out and ran forward, opened the door, and he immediately burst into tears. ""There was a lot of hugging and we got him inside."" Read more here While many sun-seekers are desperate for a foreign holiday, others have been unable to see family abroad for months because of travel restrictions. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Today's report on international travel is not the grand reopening many in the industry wanted. There is real worry, particularly among lower cost carriers, that around Â£100 per person for a PCR test on return will dissuade travellers from booking, with many paying more for it than for their flights. But there are suggestions that the government has tried to address some of the concerns too. The introduction of a green watch list, to flag any countries potentially about to move from green to amber, is an attempt to avoid some of last year's confusion, as people rushed back to the UK before countries required quarantine. Nothing is guaranteed yet, but the government now says it will confirm whether or not international travel will restart on 17 May early next month. How early is the next question. Rob EnglandBBC News Dr Bennett-Richards said the rollout had been rewarding but challenging for GPs In the last four months, more than 50% of England's adult population have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine. In London's Tower Hamlets, that figure stands at 27% - but it doesn't tell the full story of the area's vaccine rollout. Initial low vaccination coverage was down to a combination of a young population, high infection rates in January and some hesitancy among residents, according to Dr Somen Banerjee, the borough's public health director. But Dr Phillip Bennett-Richards, a health worker and volunteer vaccinator, believes attitudes towards vaccines have changed among some patients in recent weeks. ""In addition to the younger, fitter cohorts, you're seeing older people coming in to get the vaccine who initially rejected it,"" he said, adding that he suspected they wanted to ""wait a month or so"" to learn more about potential side effects and others' experiences. And the vaccination gap between different ethnicities is narrowing in the borough: Dr Banerjee said when a clinic was held at the East London Mosque, the change in attitude was clear. ""The fact we had a vaccine centre in the mosque was an endorsement of it,"" he said. ""It was evident people were there that wouldn't have come otherwise."" Continue readinghere. We've just received some more reaction to the UK government's travel plan from holiday company Tui. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, says he is ""disappointed about the expensive testing and quarantine measures proposed"". ""We're firmly committed to finding cost effective testing solutions for our customers, as well as offering maximum flexibility, so we can make travel possible this summer and beyond,"" he says. Customers due to travel between 17 May and the end of July are  able to change their holiday to another date for free. Flintham says customers who are not able to quarantine on return, or pay for tests, are able to change their holiday to a later date. Greta Thunberg has told the BBC she does not plan to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November, as she is concerned about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on attendance at COP26. The 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner believes the summit should be postponed. She says the UK government, which is hosting the summit, should wait until global vaccination rates have risen. The summit will bring together world leaders with the aim of agreeing a plan to tackle climate change. ""This needs to happen in the right way. Of course, the best thing to do would be to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible so that everyone could take part on the same terms,"" she said. Read more here.

On Thursday,Brazil recorded more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant fuels a surge in cases. Hospitals are overcrowded, with people dying as they wait for treatment in some cities, and the health system is on the brink of collapse in many areas. The country's total death toll is now almost 337,000, second only to the US, and experts are warning the current surge in cases may not peak for several weeks. But President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreak. He argues that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, and has tried to reverse some of the restrictions imposed by local authorities in the courts. He has consistently played down the severity of the virus, but he is now turning his focus to the nationwide vaccination drive which his critics say has come far too late. Read more here. Other travel industry bosses have been reacting to today's news from the government. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren says the requirement for PCR tests for passengers returning to England is ""a blow to all travellers"" and risks ""making flying only for the wealthy"". Consumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed -could cost about Â£120 per person.,external Mark Tanzer, boss of travel trade organisation Abta, says allowing the use of cheaper lateral flow tests would ""make international travel more accessible and affordable whilst still providing an effective mitigation against reimportation of the virus"". Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, says the announcement ""does not represent a reopening of travel as promised by ministers"". More industry reaction
to the UK governmentâs proposed travel plan has been coming in this morning. Jet2 has announced âwith
a heavy heartâ that it will suspend flights and holidays up to and including 23
June âbecause of the continued uncertainty that the [governmentâs] framework
providesâ. CEO Steve Heapy says he
is âextremely disappointed at the lack of clarity and detailâ in the overseas travel plan. It ""lacks any rigorous detail"" about how to get international travel going again and the framework ""is virtually the same as six months ago"", he says. Heapy adds that customers who are yet to travel and who are affected by this announcement will automatically have their booking cancelled with a full refund. ""Our team of travel experts will be in touch to help them to book their summer getaway for later in the year,"" he adds.  The Covid vaccine programme has prevented 10,400 deaths in the over 60s in England over the past four months, new analysis suggests. From the first jab on 8 December last year up to the end of March, more than 15 million jabs have been given to adults in this age group, Public Health England (PHE) said. According to its estimates, 9,100 deaths were prevented during that time in those aged 80 and over, 1,200 were avoided in those aged 70 to 79, and 100 lives were saved in those aged 60 to 69. The figures were estimated using real-world data on how effective the vaccines
are at preventing death and vaccine uptake. PHE said there was now increasing
evidence that vaccines helped to reduce transmission, therefore it was likely that
an even higher number of deaths would have been avoided by the vaccine programme. As India grapples with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections - with an average of more than 90,000 cases daily from 1 April - its vaccination drive appears to be struggling. Half a dozen states are reporting ashortage of doses,externaleven as the federal government insists that there's enough in stock. In the western state of Maharashtra, which is reporting more than half of India's new infections, the inoculation programme appears to be grinding to a halt. The local government says its current stock of 1.5 million doses will last only for three days. Vaccination centres have been shut in the state capital, Mumbai, and parts of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. ""If the vaccines don't come in three days, we will be forced to stop the drive,"" state Health Minister Rajesh Tope told reporters. Read more here. Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab. During Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. Islamic teaching says Muslims should refrain ""from anything entering the body"" between sunrise and sunset. But Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast. Read more here Elsewhere, the UK's leadingsports bodies are backing ""vaccine passports"" and Covid testingas ""credible"" means of allowing full capacities at venues. In a letter to the leaders of the major political parties, they say a certification process could be beneficial ""in getting more fans safely back as quickly as possible"". However the group also warned that ""the final approach must not be discriminatory, should protect privacy, and have clear exit criteria."" Signatories include the Football Association, the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union, the All England Tennis Club at Wimbledon and Silverstone motor-racing circuit. As part of the government's reopening road map, from 17 May in England larger outdoor sports venues will be allowed to operate at up to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 10,000 spectators. People in Wales will be able to hit the gym and form extended households a week earlier than planned due to a drop in Covid cases, the Welsh government has confirmed. Gyms and leisure centres will be able to open from 3 May - instead of 10 May - while two households can bubble up to meet indoors from the same date. Wedding receptions outdoors for up to 30 people will be allowed in Wales from 26 April, also moving forward a week. But the dates for reopening the hospitality industry have not changed - pubs, cafes and restaurants will still be able to reopen outdoors from 26 April. Read all the detailshere. Here's what's happening around the world: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has reiterated his plan to drive down the cost of coronavirus PCR tests for travellers under the travel proposals. He tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he wants the tests to be ""as cheap and convenient as
possible"". ""Iâm going to work with the travel industry and the private
testing providers to drive down that cost,"" he says. ""I wonât spare those companies that seem to be profiteering - including even potentially removing them from the recommended list. ""I donât want to see people being ripped off."" He repeats that this is the first time he is not advising against people in England booking summer holidays abroad. ""For the first time there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he says. Germany has sparked controversy by launching talks over the Russian vaccine without waiting for coordinated EU action Russiahas askedSlovakiato return 200,000
doses of its Sputnik V vaccine which have sat in storage since they were
delivered on 1 March. Former Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic got hold of the doses secretly but then lost
his job last week over the controversy. Now Slovakiaâs drug
regulator says the doses are different to those reviewed positively by the
Lancet. Germanyhas started talks on buying the Sputnik drug, according toRussiaâssovereign wealth fund. TheEUâs medical agency EMAhasnât yet approved the vaccine and
Germanyâs health minister says purchase will be conditional on its approval. For the first time in eight days the number of Covid patients in
intensive care inFrancehas fallen, by 24 cases, to 5,705. A
big surge of infections was reported on Thursday, but that includes figures
from several days. Meanwhile, France has recorded its10 millionth Covid
vaccination and a record 437,000 were inoculated yesterday alone.Germanyâscase numbers have risen above 25,000 in the past 24 hours. The Netherlands and Portugal have joined several other countries in
limiting the Oxford-AstraZeneca drug to over-60s after the EMA advised of a
possible causal link with very rare blood clots. The agency is clear that the benefits outweigh
the risks. MeanwhileFranceâshealth minister says anyone under 55 who
has already had the first AZ dose will be offered another vaccine for the
second. Icelandis revising a new rule requiring anyone
arriving from a high-risk country to stay in a special quarantine hotel for five
days or submit a second negative test. The courts have ruled that the mandatory
hotel stay is illegal. The health minister says travellers wonât have to pay
for the hotel and will be allowed outdoors. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds says the government has not given enough detail about its traffic light travel system for it to be properly scrutinised by MPs. ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing,"" he tells BBC Breakfast. ""But I have no idea what the levels of each of those are, for the government to place countries into the green category, amber or red."" He says instead the information has been ""drip-fed into the media day-by-day"" and has been announced on a day when Parliament is not sitting. ""That's extremely frustrating,"" he says. At the moment, foreign holidays are banned, and returning travellers have toquarantineon arrival. Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reason currently faces a Â£5,000 fine. The earliest possible date for holidaying abroad has been given as 17 May - if the coronavirus situation allows it. For England, the government has yet to confirm travel can take place from that date. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has saidit would be ""premature""to book a foreign summer trip.

"Amazon has fiercely opposed efforts by the RWDSU to unionise workers at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama Amazon appears likely to be headed to victory over activists hoping to establish the company's first unionised warehouse in the US.

"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, won widespread respect for his steadfast and constant support of the Queen. It was a desperately difficult role for anyone, let alone a man who had been used to naval command and who held strong views on a wide range of subjects. Yet it was that very strength of character that enabled him to discharge his responsibilities so effectively, and provide such wholehearted support to his wife in her role as Queen. As male consort to a female sovereign, Prince Philip had no constitutional position. But no-one was closer to the monarchy, or of greater importance to the monarch, than he was. Prince Philip of Greece was born on 10 June 1921 on the island of Corfu. His birth certificate shows the date as 28 May 1921, as Greece had not then adopted the Gregorian calendar. His father was Prince Andrew of Greece, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and sister of Earl Mountbatten of Burma. After a coup d'etat in 1922, his father was banished from Greece by a revolutionary court. A British warship sent by his second cousin, King George V, took the family to Italy. Baby Philip spent much of the voyage in a crib made from an orange box. His mother, Princess Alice, was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria He was the youngest child, the only boy in a family of sisters - and his early childhood was spent in a loving atmosphere. The prince began his education in France but, at the age of seven, came to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. By this time his mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and been placed in an asylum. The young prince would have little contact with her. In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany, which was run by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn. But within months, Hahn, who was Jewish, was forced to flee Nazi persecution. Hahn moved to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun school, to which the prince transferred after only two terms in Germany. Gordonstoun's Spartan regime, with its emphasis on self-reliance, was the ideal environment for a teenage boy who, separated from his parents, felt very much on his own. With war looming, Prince Philip decided on a military career. He wanted to join the Royal Air Force but his mother's family had a seafaring tradition and he became a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. While there he was delegated to escort the two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the college. According to witnesses, Prince Philip showed off a great deal. But the meeting made a deep impression on the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Philip quickly proved himself an outstanding prospect, passing out at the top of his class in January 1940 and seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. Philip (seated) thrived at Gordonstoun where he enjoyed amateur dramatics He transferred to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet, where he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. As the officer in charge of the ship's searchlights, he played a crucial role in this decisive night action. ""I found another ship and it lit up the middle part of it, whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15in shells at point-blank range,""he told BBC Radio 4 in 2014. By October 1942, he was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy, serving on board the destroyer HMS Wallace. Throughout this period, he and the young Princess Elizabeth had been exchanging letters, and he was invited to stay with the Royal Family on a number of occasions. It was after one of these visits, over Christmas 1943, that Elizabeth placed a photograph of Philip, in naval uniform, on her dressing table. Their relationship developed in peacetime, although there was opposition to it from some courtiers - one of whom described Prince Philip as ""rough and ill-mannered"". But the young princess was very much in love and, in the summer of 1946, her suitor asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage. Philip had a distinguished naval career However, before an engagement could be announced, the prince needed a new nationality and a family name. He renounced his Greek title, became a British citizen and took his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten. The day before the marriage ceremony, King George VI bestowed the title of His Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding day he was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. It was, as Winston Churchill put it, a ""flash of colour"" in a grey post-war Britain. The duke returned to his naval career and was posted to Malta where, for a while at least, the couple could live the life of any other service family. Their son, Prince Charles, was born at Buckingham Palace in 1948, and a daughter, Princess Anne, arrived in 1950. They were later joined by Prince Andrew (1960) and Prince Edward (1964). On 2 September 1950, he achieved the ambition of every naval officer when he was appointed to his own command, the sloop HMS Magpie. But his naval career was about to be curtailed. The worsening health of George VI meant his daughter had to take on more royal duties and needed her husband by her side. His wedding to Princess Elizabeth was described as ""a flash of colour in a grey post-war Britain"" Philip took leave from the Royal Navy in July 1951. He never returned in an active role. The duke was not a man to carry regrets, but he did say in later life that he was sorry he had been unable to continue his career in the navy. Contemporaries have said that he could, on his own merit, have risen to become first sea lord. In 1952, the royal couple set off on a tour of the Commonwealth originally planned to be undertaken by the King and Queen. It was while they were staying at a game lodge in Kenya in February that word came through the King had died. He had suffered a coronary thrombosis - a fatal heart blood clot. It fell to the prince to break the news to his wife that she was now Queen. A friend later described Prince Philip as looking as if ""half the world"" had dropped on him. Philip was the first to pay homage to the Queen at her coronation Deprived of his naval career, he had to create a new role for himself, and Elizabeth's accession to the throne raised the whole question of what that was to be. As the coronation approached, a Royal Warrant proclaimed that Prince Philip would have precedence after the Queen on all occasions, yet he was never to have any constitutional position. The duke was full of ideas about how best to modernise and streamline the monarchy but became increasingly disillusioned by the entrenched opposition from a number of the palace old guard. He channelled some of his energies into an active social life. He and a group of male friends met every week in rooms above a restaurant in Soho, central London. There were long, convivial lunches and visits to nightclubs and he was often photographed with glamorous companions. One area in which the duke was given free rein to exercise his authority was in the family, although he lost the battle over the name his children would carry. He had to adapt to life as a royal consort The Queen's decision that the family would carry the name of Windsor, rather than his own family name of Mountbatten, was a bitter blow. ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,"" he complained to friends. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba."" As a parent, Prince Philip could appear brusque and insensitive. According to Prince Charles's biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles was reduced to tears in his youth by public reprimands from his father and the relationship between father and eldest son was never easy. Philip insisted that Prince Charles go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the well-intentioned belief that its regime would help counter his son's somewhat retiring nature. In the event the young prince hated the school, where he suffered homesickness and was often the target of bullies. The duke's attitudes reflected the difficult nature of his own, sometimes lonely, childhood. He was forced from an early age to develop self-reliance and found it difficult to understand that not everyone shared his strength of character. His insistence that Prince Charles attend Gordonstoun caused a rift between father and son One of Prince Philip's main concerns was for the welfare of young people, and in 1956 that interest sparked the launch of his phenomenally successful Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Over the years it enabled some six million 15-to-25-year-olds - many with disabilities - the world over to challenge themselves physically, mentally and emotionally in a range of outdoor activities designed to promote teamwork, resourcefulness and a respect for nature. ""If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,"" he told the BBC, ""that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others."" Throughout his life the duke continued to devote much time to the scheme, attending various functions and involving himself in its day-to-day running. He was also a passionate advocate for wildlife and the environment, although his decision to shoot a tiger while on a trip to India in 1961 caused a furore. The publication of a photograph, in which the tiger was displayed as a trophy, only made matters worse. However, he threw his considerable influence and energy behind the World Wildlife Fund, later to become the World Wide Fund for Nature, and seemed a natural choice as its first president. The Duke of Edinburgh threw himself into his conservation efforts with typical energy and enthusiasm ""I think it's marvellous we have such a fantastic variety of life on this planet, all interdependent,"" he told a BBC interviewer. ""I think also that if we humans have the power of life or death - or extinction or survival - we ought to exercise it with some sort of moral sense. Why make something extinct if you don't have to?"" He upset some conservationists when he defended grouse shooting. ""If you have a game species, you want it to survive because you want to have some next year - exactly like a farmer. You want to crop it, you don't want to exterminate it."" But he was widely praised for his commitment to preserving the world's forests and campaigning against overfishing in the oceans. Prince Philip also took a keen interest in industry, visiting factories and becoming patron of the Industrial Society, now known as the Work Foundation. It was to a group of industrialists in 1961 that the duke displayed characteristic bluntness when he told them: ""Gentlemen, it's time we pulled our fingers out."" He took a keen interest in British industry This tendency to be forthright was interpreted by some as boorishness and sometimes got him into trouble. He certainly gained a reputation for misjudging situations, particularly when he was abroad. He made one of his most controversial comments while accompanying the Queen on a state visit to China in 1986. He made what he thought was a private remark about ""slitty eyes"". The tabloids went into a frenzy, although it seemed to cause little concern in China. On a visit to Australia in 2002, he asked an Aboriginal businessman whether ""you still throw spears at each other"". While he was heavily criticised in some quarters for such remarks, others saw them as reflecting someone who was his own man and who had refused to become bound by political correctness. Indeed, many saw his so-called ""gaffes"" as nothing more than an attempt to lighten the atmosphere and put people at their ease. Throughout his life, Prince Philip maintained an enthusiasm for sport. He sailed, played cricket and polo, excelled at carriage driving and was president of the International Equestrian Federation for many years. He had a particular passion for polo The tensions with his eldest son resurfaced with the publication of Jonathan Dimbleby's biography of Prince Charles. The Duke of Edinburgh, it was said, had pushed Charles into his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. Yet the duke was more solicitous than many critics would allow during the difficult years when his children's marriages were disintegrating. He took the lead in attempting to understand the problems, prompted perhaps by his own memories of the difficulties of marrying into the Royal Family. Prince Philip was greatly saddened by the ending of the marriages of three of his four children - Princess Anne and Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Charles. But he always refused to talk about personal matters, telling a newspaper in 1994 that he had not done so before and was not going to start then. Advancing years barely slowed the pace of his life. He continued to travel extensively, both for the World Wide Fund for Nature and with the Queen on state visits abroad. Carriage driving was one of the duke's many sporting interests And he made a personal pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1994 to visit the tomb of his mother. Her wish to be buried there had been fulfilled. There was another poignant moment for him during the 50th anniversary of VJ Day in 1995. Prince Philip had been on a British destroyer in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered and, on the anniversary, he joined other veterans of the Far East campaign in marching past the Queen on The Mall. He also expressed sympathy for those former prisoners of the Japanese who had found it hard, or indeed impossible, to forgive what had been done to them. His brusqueness mellowed a little in later years, prompted by the public's sometimes hostile attitude to the Royal Family after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. He was a source of great support to Diana, Princess of Wales In 2007, letters between the duke and the princess were published in an attempt to refute claims that he had been hostile to his daughter-in-law. Dubbed the Dearest Pa letters, they showed he had been a source of great support to Diana, a fact underlined by the warm tones in which she wrote to him. Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Diana's last companion, Dodi, even suggested at the inquest into her death that she had been murdered on Prince Philip's orders - an allegation the coroner strongly rejected. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a strong-willed and independent man who found himself at the centre of British society. He was a natural leader whose role forced him always to take second place; a man with a combative temperament that frequently sat uneasily with the sensitivities of his position. ""I've just done what I think was my best,"" he once told the BBC. ""I can't suddenly change my whole way of doing things, I can't change my interests or the way I react to things. That's just my style."" The Queen referred to him as her 'strength and stay' The duke retired from public life in August 2017 after decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. Buckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952, and Theresa May, the then prime minister, thanked him for a ""remarkable life of public service"". Philip celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary later that year.

Two women in the other car were injured, and the duke voluntarily surrendered his driver's licence. During the coronavirus pandemic, Philip and the Queen moved to Windsor Castle, and were given a vaccine in January 2021. Philip was successful in using his position to make a huge contribution to British life and played his part in helping the monarchy come to terms with changing social attitudes over the years.

He believed his job was, as he told his biographer, ""to ensure the Queen can reign"".

"The Duke of Edinburgh was born in the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921. His family tree includes members of the royal families of Denmark, Germany, Russia and Britain. Prince Philip was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. The prince began his education in France at the MacJannet American school in St-Cloud and is seen here (second from left) with his schoolmates. At the age of seven he went to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. Later he attended Gordonstoun boarding school, founded by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn in northern Scotland, where he excelled at sport. This is believed to be the first time Princess Elizabeth (third from left) and the then naval cadet Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark (in the white cap on the far right) were pictured together. It was taken during a visit to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth on 23 July 1939. During World War Two, Prince Philip saw action as a midshipman on the battleship HMS Valiant. When the Italian fleet was trapped off Greece in 1941, Philip commanded the searchlights that illuminated the enemy and he was later mentioned in dispatches. His engagement to Princess Elizabeth was officially announced in July 1947. They married on 20 November that year. In 1951 a photographer caught the moment the Duke of Edinburgh jumped off his water skis as he reached the beach at Marmaris in Turkey. It was taken during his last posting as commander of HMS Magpie. The prince is seen here playing polo for Cowdray Park in the semi-finals of the Roehampton Cup. He was one of the leading polo players in Britain. The duke was also a keen cricketer. Here his team, made up of former England stars, were pitted against one captained by the Duke of Norfolk, with Sussex players. The duke and Queen had four children, (from left) Edward, Andrew, Anne and Charles, pictured here in the 1960s. The couple are seen here during a visit to a farm on their Balmoral estate, to celebrate their Silver Wedding anniversary. In 1977 the prince accompanied the Queen as she celebrated her Silver Jubilee. They are seen here both wearing Maori Kahu-Kiwi (Kiwi feather cloaks) at Rugby Park in Gisborne, on the North Island of New Zealand when they attended the opening of the Royal New Zealand Polynesian Festival in February. Later that year the royal couple waved as Concorde flew past the Royal Yacht Britannia as they neared Barbados. In August 1979 the Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA bomb blast on his boat in Ireland. The Duke of Edinburgh returned to the UK after hearing the news, having taken part in a coach-driving championship in Normandy, northern France. Nature and conservation were lifelong passions of the Duke of Edinburgh and he seemed a natural choice to become the international president of what was then the World Wildlife Fund. In 1985 the Duke of Edinburgh was surrounded by his family, including the young princes William and Harry, as they gathered to watch a flypast over Buckingham Palace after Trooping the Colour. In 1996 the duke escorted the South African President Nelson Mandela as he prepared to review an honour guard in Horse Guards Parade on the first day of his state visit to Britain. Prince Philip supported the Queen through more than 60 years of her reign, including the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. The prince set up the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, which is aimed at developing young people's abilities, in 1956. Here he shares a joke with Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holders at Holyroodhouse in 2010. The duke continued to compete in sport late in his life, including this carriage-driving event at Sandringham in 2005. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace to greet the Royal Family after the wedding of Prince Philip's grandson, Prince William, to Catherine Middleton in 2011. Twelve months later, the prince had appeared to be in good health when he accompanied the Queen on the royal barge, the Spirit of Chartwell, which formed part of the rain-drenched Diamond Jubilee river pageant on 3 June 2012. He and the Queen stood for most of the 80-minute journey, as they were accompanied by 1,000 boats travelling seven miles down the River Thames to Tower Bridge. However, the duke was admitted to hospital with a bladder infection before the Diamond Jubilee concert on 4 June. After making a recovery, he was fit enough to accompany Princess Anne to watch Great Britain's equestrian team, which included his granddaughter Zara Phillips, compete in the eventing at the 2012 London Olympics. In June 2013 the duke attended a church service at Westminster Abbey to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation. In 2014 he accompanied the Queen on a tour of Northern Ireland. He is pictured here signing the visitors book at Hillsborough Castle, Belfast. Queen Elizabeth II accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh lit the first of more than 200 beacons to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE Day at Windsor Castle. The duke and his son Charles shared a funny moment together during a visit to Poundbury, an urban development on the edge of Dorchester, where the Queen unveiled a statue of the Queen Mother. In April 2017 the duke accompanied his wife to open a new Centre for Elephant Care at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. In May however he announced he was to stand down from public engagements at the age of 95, with the full support of the Queen. Alongside the Queen the duke observed a minute's silence at the start of a garden party at Buckingham Palace on 23 May 2017 in tribute to those killed at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The duke has been the longest-serving royal consort in British history.

"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, won widespread respect for his steadfast and constant support of the Queen. It was a desperately difficult role for anyone, let alone a man who had been used to naval command and who held strong views on a wide range of subjects. Yet it was that very strength of character that enabled him to discharge his responsibilities so effectively, and provide such wholehearted support to his wife in her role as Queen. As male consort to a female sovereign, Prince Philip had no constitutional position. But no-one was closer to the monarchy, or of greater importance to the monarch, than he was. Prince Philip of Greece was born on 10 June 1921 on the island of Corfu. His birth certificate shows the date as 28 May 1921, as Greece had not then adopted the Gregorian calendar. His father was Prince Andrew of Greece, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and sister of Earl Mountbatten of Burma. After a coup d'etat in 1922, his father was banished from Greece by a revolutionary court. A British warship sent by his second cousin, King George V, took the family to Italy. Baby Philip spent much of the voyage in a crib made from an orange box. His mother, Princess Alice, was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria He was the youngest child, the only boy in a family of sisters - and his early childhood was spent in a loving atmosphere. The prince began his education in France but, at the age of seven, came to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. By this time his mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and been placed in an asylum. The young prince would have little contact with her. In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany, which was run by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn. But within months, Hahn, who was Jewish, was forced to flee Nazi persecution. Hahn moved to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun school, to which the prince transferred after only two terms in Germany. Gordonstoun's Spartan regime, with its emphasis on self-reliance, was the ideal environment for a teenage boy who, separated from his parents, felt very much on his own. With war looming, Prince Philip decided on a military career. He wanted to join the Royal Air Force but his mother's family had a seafaring tradition and he became a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. While there he was delegated to escort the two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the college. According to witnesses, Prince Philip showed off a great deal. But the meeting made a deep impression on the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Philip quickly proved himself an outstanding prospect, passing out at the top of his class in January 1940 and seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. Philip (seated) thrived at Gordonstoun where he enjoyed amateur dramatics He transferred to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet, where he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. As the officer in charge of the ship's searchlights, he played a crucial role in this decisive night action. ""I found another ship and it lit up the middle part of it, whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15in shells at point-blank range,""he told BBC Radio 4 in 2014. By October 1942, he was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy, serving on board the destroyer HMS Wallace. Throughout this period, he and the young Princess Elizabeth had been exchanging letters, and he was invited to stay with the Royal Family on a number of occasions. It was after one of these visits, over Christmas 1943, that Elizabeth placed a photograph of Philip, in naval uniform, on her dressing table. Their relationship developed in peacetime, although there was opposition to it from some courtiers - one of whom described Prince Philip as ""rough and ill-mannered"". But the young princess was very much in love and, in the summer of 1946, her suitor asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage. Philip had a distinguished naval career However, before an engagement could be announced, the prince needed a new nationality and a family name. He renounced his Greek title, became a British citizen and took his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten. The day before the marriage ceremony, King George VI bestowed the title of His Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding day he was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. It was, as Winston Churchill put it, a ""flash of colour"" in a grey post-war Britain. The duke returned to his naval career and was posted to Malta where, for a while at least, the couple could live the life of any other service family. Their son, Prince Charles, was born at Buckingham Palace in 1948, and a daughter, Princess Anne, arrived in 1950. They were later joined by Prince Andrew (1960) and Prince Edward (1964). On 2 September 1950, he achieved the ambition of every naval officer when he was appointed to his own command, the sloop HMS Magpie. But his naval career was about to be curtailed. The worsening health of George VI meant his daughter had to take on more royal duties and needed her husband by her side. His wedding to Princess Elizabeth was described as ""a flash of colour in a grey post-war Britain"" Philip took leave from the Royal Navy in July 1951. He never returned in an active role. The duke was not a man to carry regrets, but he did say in later life that he was sorry he had been unable to continue his career in the navy. Contemporaries have said that he could, on his own merit, have risen to become first sea lord. In 1952, the royal couple set off on a tour of the Commonwealth originally planned to be undertaken by the King and Queen. It was while they were staying at a game lodge in Kenya in February that word came through the King had died. He had suffered a coronary thrombosis - a fatal heart blood clot. It fell to the prince to break the news to his wife that she was now Queen. A friend later described Prince Philip as looking as if ""half the world"" had dropped on him. Philip was the first to pay homage to the Queen at her coronation Deprived of his naval career, he had to create a new role for himself, and Elizabeth's accession to the throne raised the whole question of what that was to be. As the coronation approached, a Royal Warrant proclaimed that Prince Philip would have precedence after the Queen on all occasions, yet he was never to have any constitutional position. The duke was full of ideas about how best to modernise and streamline the monarchy but became increasingly disillusioned by the entrenched opposition from a number of the palace old guard. He channelled some of his energies into an active social life. He and a group of male friends met every week in rooms above a restaurant in Soho, central London. There were long, convivial lunches and visits to nightclubs and he was often photographed with glamorous companions. One area in which the duke was given free rein to exercise his authority was in the family, although he lost the battle over the name his children would carry. He had to adapt to life as a royal consort The Queen's decision that the family would carry the name of Windsor, rather than his own family name of Mountbatten, was a bitter blow. ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,"" he complained to friends. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba."" As a parent, Prince Philip could appear brusque and insensitive. According to Prince Charles's biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles was reduced to tears in his youth by public reprimands from his father and the relationship between father and eldest son was never easy. Philip insisted that Prince Charles go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the well-intentioned belief that its regime would help counter his son's somewhat retiring nature. In the event the young prince hated the school, where he suffered homesickness and was often the target of bullies. The duke's attitudes reflected the difficult nature of his own, sometimes lonely, childhood. He was forced from an early age to develop self-reliance and found it difficult to understand that not everyone shared his strength of character. His insistence that Prince Charles attend Gordonstoun caused a rift between father and son One of Prince Philip's main concerns was for the welfare of young people, and in 1956 that interest sparked the launch of his phenomenally successful Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Over the years it enabled some six million 15-to-25-year-olds - many with disabilities - the world over to challenge themselves physically, mentally and emotionally in a range of outdoor activities designed to promote teamwork, resourcefulness and a respect for nature.

"The renewed tension in Northern Ireland could have far-reaching implications for the future of the United Kingdom - and post-Brexit relations with the EU. The violence that has erupted this week on the streets of Belfast and other towns and cities in Northern Irelandhas many causes. But anger about post-Brexit trading rules that came into force in February is a factor. The section of the Brexit deal known as the ""protocol"" was designed to protect the peace process by avoiding the need for checks on the border with Ireland. But it also means that some European laws continue to apply in Northern Ireland. And that has reinforced long-held feelings among Unionists that they are being cut off from the rest of the UK - and that they've been misled by the UK government and that the EU is not listening. Police use water cannon during further riots in NI Timeline: How Northern Ireland's violence unfolded Belfast rioting 'worst seen in N Ireland in years' Much of the focus in talks with Brussels on the UK's departure from the EU was on ensuring that trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain could continue freely - to be ""unfettered"". That's what Prime Minister Boris Johnson meant when, in the run up to the 2019 general election, he famouslytold traders they would have his permissionto throw away any new paperwork. This video can not be played ""There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,"" Boris Johnson tells Conservative supporters It also gave many the impression that trade in the other direction - from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - would be just as smooth. This was despite warnings from the EU, and UK civil servants, that the new rules would inevitably lead to more friction. The past few months have provided real-world examples as the Protocol kicked in: Imports of plant and animal products, such as mozzarella cheese, into Northern Ireland from Great Britain now require multiple forms, when previously there were fewer or none Some firms such as John Lewis suspended delivery of parcels to Northern Ireland, and some packages from Great Britain were labelled as ""international"", although the department store chainhas resumed most deliveries now Two cigarette manufacturerssaid they would reduce the range of products,externalon sale in Northern Ireland because EU rules on packaging remained People moving house from Great Britain to Northern Irelandneed a customs declaration for their possessionsif they use a removals firm Some of the problems were temporary and have gone away. Others are on the way to being solved with workarounds, or with money or support schemes. Some have been booted into the long grass, with ""grace periods"" before the rules are fully applied. One European diplomat, who helped to write the Brexit deal, told me it was unlikely that any of these issues had inspired teenagers to throw missiles at the police this week. Youths clash with police in West Belfast But each one is a reminder that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK because of a treaty agreed by the UK government. And the rhetoric of Unionist politicians suggests it is unlikely that the differences can ever be minimised in a way that satisfies them. They would prefer the Protocol was suspended - which would be allowed if there was a serious threat to security or the economy - or permanently junked. That will be the DUP's pitch at the elections for the Northern Ireland assembly next May. And again when Stormont votes on the continuation of the Protocol in 2024. Which means the instability around the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland is likely to continue for years. And it could get even worse. I recently spoke to one of the UK's Brexit negotiators, who asked: How will Northern Irish Leave voters feel if the European Court of Justice is ever asked to rule on how the Protocol is being applied? British observers also fear that DUP leader Arlene Foster is being forced into increasingly extreme positions - by her own party and by voters demanding an even stronger brand of unionism. One government advisor also suggested to me that Unionist leaders were whipping up their supporters, risking a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" where politicians use inflammatory language, which winds up the public, which then demands an ever-tougher response. Arlene Foster has called for an end to the violence That makes it more difficult for the DUP to share power with Sinn Fein, which threatens devolved government and the peace process. It also makes it harder for the Northern Irish government to build inspection posts at ports and other things it is meant to implement under the terms of the protocol, potentially undermining the Brexit deal itself. Boris Johnson is also under pressure from some of his own Conservative MPs, who are still pressing for alternative solutions to the Irish border issue, even though these solutions were rejected by the EU many times during the Brexit negotiations. And what about the EU? The British government accuses them of being deaf to the needs of Unionists and of putting the interests of those who care more about Northern Ireland's relationship with Ireland ahead of those who care about its relationship with Great Britain. UK ministers say the EU gave Unionists another reason to be upset by almost accidentally suspending the Protocol in January when it was designing a mechanism to screen exports of Coronavirus vaccines. The EU quickly corrected its mistake and apologised. Officials in Brussels say privately that the problems in Northern Ireland are because the UK was not honest about the changes that were coming and acted too late to minimise their impact. The biggest question of all is the degree to which the implementation of the Brexit deal affects the number of Northern Irish citizens saying they would like to be part of Ireland. British law compels the Northern Ireland Secretary to hold a referendum - aborder poll- if there is evidence that a majority of the population wants reunification. Opinion polls suggest a small but growing minority in favour but the law is silent about what evidence should be considered or how a vote would work. This potential break-up of the UK is why the technical details of the Brexit deal matter to politicians in London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels. And to people on the streets in Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Londonderry.

"The rioting has mostly involved gangs of youths armed with bricks and petrol bombs Nearly 90 officers have been hurt inNorthern Ireland's worst street violence for years, after sporadic rioting in several towns and cities since the end of March. The governments in Belfast, London and Dublin have condemned the unrest, with the US calling for calmas police used water cannons for the first time in six years. Eighteen people have been arrested and 15 charged after crowds of predominantly loyalist youths attacked lines of riot police officers and vehicles with bricks, fireworks and petrol bombs. Saturday night was the first without major incident since Good Friday on 2 April, with the lack of trouble being linked to the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. While all Northern Ireland's main parties havecondemned the violence, they are divided about its causes. Since the end of March, there has been unrest on a near-nightly basis, mainly in loyalist areas of a number of towns and cities Violence involving gangs of youthsstarted on 29 March in an area of Londonderrythat is loyalist - in favour of keeping Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Until the death of Prince Philip on 9 April, there were protests and rioting on a near-nightly basis in a number of towns and cities, including Belfast, Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Newtownabbey. The areas affected are among the most deprived in the country, withthe lowest level of educational attainment in Europe,external. On the night of 7 April, the fighting spilled over a so-called peace wall in west Belfast that divides predominantly Protestant loyalist communities from predominantly Catholic nationalist communities who want to see a united Ireland. A gate that divides the two was smashed open and, during several hours of disorder, police officers and a press photographer were attacked and a bus was hijacked and burned. The clashes raised concerns of escalating sectarian tensions. Parts of Northern Ireland are still split along sectarian lines, 23 years after a peace deal largely ended Northern Ireland's Troubles -which lasted almost 30 years and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people. While there are no clear indications the unrest is being orchestrated by an organised group, the violence has been concentrated in areas where criminal gangs linked to loyalist paramilitaries have significant influence. The violence has been concentrated in areas where loyalist paramilitaries have significant influence There is increasing evidence that senior figures in organisations such as the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force are allowing the trouble to proceed. Analysts suggest loyalist paramilitaries of the South East Antrim UDA may have exploited an opportunity tokick back at the Police Service of Northern Ireland after a recent clampdown on criminalityin the area around Carrickfergus. Some of the unrest has involved adults egging on children to get involved in violence The paramilitary group is involved in many forms of organised crime, doing ""untold damage to the community and exerting fear in neighbourhoods"", say police. Northern Ireland's children's commissioner said adults engaged in ""criminal exploitation"" of fighting youths ""had to be held accountable"". Koulla Yiasouma said the violence involved ""coercion by adults of vulnerable and at-risk children"". Read more:'A criminal cartel wrapped in a flag' Unionist leaders have linked the violence to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. The new trading border is the result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, introduced to avoid the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK The protocol means Northern Ireland remains in the EU single market for goods, so products being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland undergo EU import procedures. Itavoids the need for checks on the Irish border, as EU customs rules are enforced at Northern Ireland's ports instead. Unionists say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In January, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border was daubed on walls in some loyalist areas, including parts of Bangor, Belfast, Glengormley, and the home of one of Northern Ireland's main ports, Larne. These Brexit checks were temporarily suspendedamid reported threats against port workers in Larne and Belfast - although the police later saidthere was no evidence of ""credible threats"". Timeline: How the violence has unfolded Young voices: Rioters urged 'not to throw lives away' Watch: What is the Good Friday Agreement? Explainer: The Northern Ireland Protocol In March, a group which includes representatives of loyalist paramilitarieswrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to withdraw its support for the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal that effectively ended the Troubles. The Loyalist Communities Council said it was temporarily withdrawing its backing because of concerns about the protocol. Lord Frost, the UK Brexit minister, is to meet EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic in Brussels on Thursdayto discuss plans about implementing the protocol. Read more:What is Brexit doing to Northern Ireland? Some unionist leaders have attributed the violence to the decision not to prosecute leaders of the republican Sinn FÃ©in party for breaching Covid regulationsat the funeral of a former IRA intelligence chief last June. Some 2,000 mourners lined the streets for the funeral of former IRA intelligence chief Bobby Storey in June 2020 Bobby Storey's funeral drew 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when strict Covid restrictions were still in place, limiting the number of people who could gather in public. Many people expressed anger at Ms O'Neill for failing to follow the guidance she insisted the public should follow - guidance which had led to loyalist band parades being cancelled last summer. Some have accused police of double standards after the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said there would be no prosecutions - against the police's recommendations. WhileDUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said she did not share that view,she called on PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign. Mr Byrne said he recognised people were angry, but has refused to step down. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said the PSNI and the Policing Board need to reconnect with communities to restore trust, adding that the decision not to bring charges over Bobby Storey's funeral had ""a very substantial impact"" on the street violence.

"This video can not be played Chris Gentile said his coach company is one of many choosing to delay foreign trips Some coach companies have said they will not run international trips this year, even if lockdown rules change to allow it. Voel Coaches, based in Denbighshire, normally offers them but said it had already decided to cancel. It said other coach operators across the UK it had spoken to were making the same decision. Under current lockdown restrictions it isillegal to travel abroad,externalfrom anywhere in the UK for a holiday. There is currently no date for when people in Wales will be able to travel abroad for leisure. The Denbighshire-based company does not plan to run trips abroad until 2022 Voel has a fleet of 38 coaches and during the summer season around half of the holidays it offers would involve trips abroad. Marketing manager Chris Gentile said: ""No matter what happens at this time, we will not be changing our mind"" and that ""if the government had been very clear, in their guidance, from day one, things could have been different"". When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? 'Stay-local' rule in Wales to end from Saturday He said that if the company did take customers overseas and there were rule changes, then it ""would open us up to some great risks"" having to get a coach full of passengers back to Wales. When Covid first hit last year one of its coaches was in Spain and ""had literally hours to get across the border"", he said. He said he had been in contact with a number of other coach tour operators throughout the UK and many of them had made a similar decision not to run foreign holidays this year because ""there's too much of a risk"". ""We're an industry that's been affected really bad and I don't think the risks really add up to even attempting that - I don't think it's the right thing to do."" Mr Gentile said it would be March next year before the company looked at offering holidays overseas again, which means it will also be missing out on taking passengers abroad for the next ski season. Ann Jones says Covid restrictions may bring younger people back to traditional travel agents One travel agent said many people were being cautious when it comes to booking holidays abroad in the summer months. Ann Jones from Teithiau Menai Travel in Caernarfon said booking inquiries had been ""fluctuating"" in recent months and many customers were looking beyond this summer for a trip abroad. She said she had been rescheduling holidays ""sometimes for a third time"" and it was ""very complicated"" because of uncertainty caused by Covid restrictions. ""It's a lot of hard work and especially when you have no income coming in for it because we in travel don't get a penny for working until people actually go on their holidays,"" she said. But she believed the complications involved in trying to arrange overseas travel could be a boost to bring customers back to traditional travel agents - particularly for younger people who would normally book online. ""They've found that they haven't been able to contact anyone, speak to anyone, talk about the refunds or moving their holidays,"" she said. What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The tests are coming out too expensive, we are trying to drive that down."" People in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. But he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry. Mr Shapps has also given more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk. Passengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk ""green"" countries. There will also be a watch list for countries most at risk of going from green to amber to provide greater assurance for those looking to travel abroad. When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Which countries are on the UK's travel ban list? Announcing thefindings of the Global Travel Taskforce,externalset up by the government to examine how leisure travel could be reopened safely after lockdown, Mr Shapps said foreign holidays would resume on 17 May at the earliest. He told the BBC: ""This is the first time I'm able to come on and say I'm not advising against booking foreign holidays. ""Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. ""But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place."" Mr Shapps said the use of PCR tests - those needing to be sent to a lab - enabled scientists to detect potential variants of concern. But he said he was ""concerned"" about the cost of the tests, adding that the government was committed to driving down the price of these by working with the private sector. The transport secretary also said the government was looking at the possibility of people bringing pre-departure tests with them that they can use before boarding their return flight, pointing out that people are now able to order free lateral flow tests. On Friday,the UK confirmed another 3,150 virus cases,external, and another 60 deaths of people who had tested positive in the past 28 days. Mr Shapps said countries would be categorised based on level of infections and vaccinations, variants of concern and the quality of their genetic sequencing. He said this list would be kept under constant review and that he was hopeful European countries would be upgraded as their vaccination rates improve. Mr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. The government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. Nearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK. The earliest date holidays abroad could be allowed under the current roadmap out of lockdown is 17 May The rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said. Further formal reviews will take place at ""checkpoints"" no later than 31 July and 1 October. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. He told the BBC: ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red."" The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be ""premature"" to book a foreign summer trip.

"Mr Kim made his rare admission of looming hardship at a party conference North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has told citizens to prepare for hard times ahead, following warnings from rights groups that the country faces dire food shortages and economic instability. Speaking at a party conference, Mr Kim appeared to compare the situation to the devastating 1990s famine, estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands. North Korea has shut its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trade with China, its economic lifeline, has come to a standstill. This is on top of existing international economic sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Imagine a North Korean family... North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The South Koreans enslaved in the North's mines In a rare admission of looming hardship, the authoritarian leader of the single-party state on Thursday called on officials to ""wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little"". The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death is not known, but estimates range up to 3 million. North Korea often struggles to feed its people ""It is not unusual for Kim Jong-un to talk about difficulties and hardship but this time the language is quite stark and that's different,"" Colin Zwirko, North Korea analyst at NK News, told the BBC. ""Last October for instance,he gave a speech where he said that he himself failed to bring about enough changes. But mentioning explicitly that he's decided to carry out a new Arduous March is not something he has said before."" Earlier this week, Mr Kim had warned the country faced the ""worst-ever situation"" and ""unprecedentedly numerous challenges"". There have been warnings for months that the people of North Korea are struggling. Reports of hardship appear to be coming especially from towns near the Chinese border, where smuggling would have been a huge earner for many. The price of corn, the staple diet for most of rural North Korea, has reportedly fluctuated enormously and at times a kilogram of corn has cost more than a month's wages. Lina Yoon, a researcher from Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a recent report,externalciting unnamed contacts in the country that ""there is barely any food going into the country from China"". ""There are so many more beggars, some people died from hunger in the border area, and there's no soap, toothpaste, or batteries,"" she wrote. What's it like to live in North Korea? Russians leave North Korea on hand-pushed trolley The UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, TomÃ¡s Ojea Quintana,warned last month in a report of a ""serious food crisis"",externalalready leading to malnourishment and starvation. ""Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them."" It is unclear whether any aid at all is currently coming into the country. North Korea has rejected offers of external aid and almost all diplomats and aid workers, including staff of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), have left. Meanwhile North Korea's border closures means trade with China dropped by 80% last year from levels that had already fallen significantly in 2018 when the UN expanded sanctions over North Korea's nuclear programme. Reports suggest North Korea restricted imports of staple foods from China last August and then cut almost all trade, including food and medicines, in October. The country has also ramped up punishments for smuggling, describing it as ""anti-socialist"" and ""enemy"" behaviour, according to HRW. North Korea was also hit by two major storms last summer, which caused flooding that is believed to have damaged crops, exacerbating the shortages. Kim Jong-un is shoring up support within his party as times get tough. He's making sure that the warnings are coming from him - perhaps so that when things get worse, he can point the finger at his officials for not acting on his orders. He can also pin blame for the dire economy on the Covid-19 pandemic and the strict economic sanctions designed to curb his nuclear weapons programme. And yet his regime continues to design and test new missiles. The weapons tests are something we can all see on satellite images and state media photos, and use them to question world leaders about how they are going to act. The North Korean people cannot get images of their suffering to us without the risk of being imprisoned or shot. Unseen, and according to warnings by their own leader, they now face going hungry amid a looming humanitarian crisis. Tightly controlled by the government, North Korea's economy is one of the least free in the world and is said to be highly inefficient. The enormous cost of maintaining the military and security structures has left very little for the ordinary North Korean. The almost complete border closure aims to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in a country that does not have the public health infrastructure to handle an outbreak. However there are indications that Pyongyang is feeling pressure to reopen borders at least a bit, Mr Zwirko said. ""North Korea has shown signs of wanting to increase trade with China again. They have passed a law a few months ago to help facilitate border trade,"" he said. ""But fundamentally, North Korea remains extremely paranoid about the virus. They'd really have to change and trust in the ability to disinfect goods that would come through.""

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The tests are coming out too expensive, we are trying to drive that down."" People in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. But he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry. Mr Shapps has also given more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk. Passengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk ""green"" countries. There will also be a watch list for countries most at risk of going from green to amber to provide greater assurance for those looking to travel abroad. When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Which countries are on the UK's travel ban list? Announcing thefindings of the Global Travel Taskforce,externalset up by the government to examine how leisure travel could be reopened safely after lockdown, Mr Shapps said foreign holidays would resume on 17 May at the earliest. He told the BBC: ""This is the first time I'm able to come on and say I'm not advising against booking foreign holidays. ""Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. ""But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place."" Mr Shapps said the use of PCR tests - those needing to be sent to a lab - enabled scientists to detect potential variants of concern. But he said he was ""concerned"" about the cost of the tests, adding that the government was committed to driving down the price of these by working with the private sector. The transport secretary also said the government was looking at the possibility of people bringing pre-departure tests with them that they can use before boarding their return flight, pointing out that people are now able to order free lateral flow tests. On Friday,the UK confirmed another 3,150 virus cases,external, and another 60 deaths of people who had tested positive in the past 28 days. Mr Shapps said countries would be categorised based on level of infections and vaccinations, variants of concern and the quality of their genetic sequencing. He said this list would be kept under constant review and that he was hopeful European countries would be upgraded as their vaccination rates improve. Mr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. The government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. Nearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK. The earliest date holidays abroad could be allowed under the current roadmap out of lockdown is 17 May The rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said. Further formal reviews will take place at ""checkpoints"" no later than 31 July and 1 October. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. He told the BBC: ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red."" The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be ""premature"" to book a foreign summer trip.

The suspect, from Gillingham, and the victims were known to each other. He was arrested after being stopped in a vehicle in Hammersmith, London, and was taken to hospital. A cordon remains in place at Sir Richard's Dorset property and police have appealed for information. Dorset Police said the victim and the arrested man were known to each other Sir Richard, who was number 435 in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, owned several top hotels and had a large property and farming portfolio. He owned the freehold of the Sheraton Grand London Park Lane and the Athenaeum Hotel in Mayfair. A statement from the businessman's company, Sir Richard Sutton Limited, said staff were ""deeply saddened and devastated by the sudden death"". ""Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family,"" it said. A police cordon is still in place at the country estate in Gillingham North Dorset Conservative MP Simon Hoare, who was a friend of Sir Richard, said he had received a briefing from Dorset Police and described the death as ""deeply awful"".

"The UK government gives more detail on its traffic light system for the resumption of overseas travel from England Travellers will need to pay for tests when departing and returning from abroad, including at least one PCR test Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the cost of Covid tests needs to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel sector Shapps also says he's not advising against people in England booking summer trips abroad It's still too early to say whether foreign holidays can resume on 17 May, he says, or which countries will be deemed to be safe Twice-weekly free rapid coronavirus tests are available to everyone in England from today Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab Brazil records more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant circulates Edited by Holly Wallis ITV presenter Kate Garraway's husband has returned home after more than a year in hospital being treated for Covid-19. Former political adviser Derek Draper, 53, was admitted in March last year with coronavirus symptoms, before having to be put into a coma. Garraway says he ""absolutely knew he was home"" but has not yet regained his speech and will require round-the-clock care. She and her young family all ""burst into tears"" when he arrived home. ""As we pulled up, I could see two little faces, Darcey and Billy [their children] looking out the window, and I could literally see them go, 'he's here,'"" she tells her Good Morning Britain colleagues. ""And they sort of ran out and ran forward, opened the door, and he immediately burst into tears. ""There was a lot of hugging and we got him inside."" Read more here While many sun-seekers are desperate for a foreign holiday, others have been unable to see family abroad for months because of travel restrictions. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Today's report on international travel is not the grand reopening many in the industry wanted. There is real worry, particularly among lower cost carriers, that around Â£100 per person for a PCR test on return will dissuade travellers from booking, with many paying more for it than for their flights. But there are suggestions that the government has tried to address some of the concerns too. The introduction of a green watch list, to flag any countries potentially about to move from green to amber, is an attempt to avoid some of last year's confusion, as people rushed back to the UK before countries required quarantine. Nothing is guaranteed yet, but the government now says it will confirm whether or not international travel will restart on 17 May early next month. How early is the next question. Rob EnglandBBC News Dr Bennett-Richards said the rollout had been rewarding but challenging for GPs In the last four months, more than 50% of England's adult population have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine. In London's Tower Hamlets, that figure stands at 27% - but it doesn't tell the full story of the area's vaccine rollout. Initial low vaccination coverage was down to a combination of a young population, high infection rates in January and some hesitancy among residents, according to Dr Somen Banerjee, the borough's public health director. But Dr Phillip Bennett-Richards, a health worker and volunteer vaccinator, believes attitudes towards vaccines have changed among some patients in recent weeks. ""In addition to the younger, fitter cohorts, you're seeing older people coming in to get the vaccine who initially rejected it,"" he said, adding that he suspected they wanted to ""wait a month or so"" to learn more about potential side effects and others' experiences. And the vaccination gap between different ethnicities is narrowing in the borough: Dr Banerjee said when a clinic was held at the East London Mosque, the change in attitude was clear. ""The fact we had a vaccine centre in the mosque was an endorsement of it,"" he said. ""It was evident people were there that wouldn't have come otherwise."" Continue readinghere. We've just received some more reaction to the UK government's travel plan from holiday company Tui. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, says he is ""disappointed about the expensive testing and quarantine measures proposed"". ""We're firmly committed to finding cost effective testing solutions for our customers, as well as offering maximum flexibility, so we can make travel possible this summer and beyond,"" he says. Customers due to travel between 17 May and the end of July are  able to change their holiday to another date for free. Flintham says customers who are not able to quarantine on return, or pay for tests, are able to change their holiday to a later date. Greta Thunberg has told the BBC she does not plan to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November, as she is concerned about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on attendance at COP26. The 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner believes the summit should be postponed. She says the UK government, which is hosting the summit, should wait until global vaccination rates have risen. The summit will bring together world leaders with the aim of agreeing a plan to tackle climate change. ""This needs to happen in the right way. Of course, the best thing to do would be to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible so that everyone could take part on the same terms,"" she said. Read more here. Victoria GillScience correspondent, BBC News Fish larvae use the sound of a healthy reef to find their way 'home' Ocean scientists around the world are studying the ""unique moment"" of quiet created by the pandemic in a vast listening experiment called ""the year of the quiet ocean"". ""Lockdown slowed global shipping on a scale that would otherwise be impossible,"" says Prof Peter Tyack from the University of St Andrews. The scientists plan to listen to the ocean soundscape before, during and after lockdown.

On Thursday,Brazil recorded more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant fuels a surge in cases. Hospitals are overcrowded, with people dying as they wait for treatment in some cities, and the health system is on the brink of collapse in many areas. The country's total death toll is now almost 337,000, second only to the US, and experts are warning the current surge in cases may not peak for several weeks. But President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreak. He argues that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, and has tried to reverse some of the restrictions imposed by local authorities in the courts. He has consistently played down the severity of the virus, but he is now turning his focus to the nationwide vaccination drive which his critics say has come far too late. Read more here. Other travel industry bosses have been reacting to today's news from the government. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren says the requirement for PCR tests for passengers returning to England is ""a blow to all travellers"" and risks ""making flying only for the wealthy"". Consumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed -could cost about Â£120 per person.,external Mark Tanzer, boss of travel trade organisation Abta, says allowing the use of cheaper lateral flow tests would ""make international travel more accessible and affordable whilst still providing an effective mitigation against reimportation of the virus"". Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, says the announcement ""does not represent a reopening of travel as promised by ministers"". More industry reaction
to the UK governmentâs proposed travel plan has been coming in this morning. Jet2 has announced âwith
a heavy heartâ that it will suspend flights and holidays up to and including 23
June âbecause of the continued uncertainty that the [governmentâs] framework
providesâ. CEO Steve Heapy says he
is âextremely disappointed at the lack of clarity and detailâ in the overseas travel plan. It ""lacks any rigorous detail"" about how to get international travel going again and the framework ""is virtually the same as six months ago"", he says. Heapy adds that customers who are yet to travel and who are affected by this announcement will automatically have their booking cancelled with a full refund. ""Our team of travel experts will be in touch to help them to book their summer getaway for later in the year,"" he adds.  The Covid vaccine programme has prevented 10,400 deaths in the over 60s in England over the past four months, new analysis suggests. From the first jab on 8 December last year up to the end of March, more than 15 million jabs have been given to adults in this age group, Public Health England (PHE) said. According to its estimates, 9,100 deaths were prevented during that time in those aged 80 and over, 1,200 were avoided in those aged 70 to 79, and 100 lives were saved in those aged 60 to 69. The figures were estimated using real-world data on how effective the vaccines
are at preventing death and vaccine uptake. PHE said there was now increasing
evidence that vaccines helped to reduce transmission, therefore it was likely that
an even higher number of deaths would have been avoided by the vaccine programme. As India grapples with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections - with an average of more than 90,000 cases daily from 1 April - its vaccination drive appears to be struggling. Half a dozen states are reporting ashortage of doses,externaleven as the federal government insists that there's enough in stock. In the western state of Maharashtra, which is reporting more than half of India's new infections, the inoculation programme appears to be grinding to a halt. The local government says its current stock of 1.5 million doses will last only for three days. Vaccination centres have been shut in the state capital, Mumbai, and parts of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. ""If the vaccines don't come in three days, we will be forced to stop the drive,"" state Health Minister Rajesh Tope told reporters. Read more here. Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab. During Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. Islamic teaching says Muslims should refrain ""from anything entering the body"" between sunrise and sunset. But Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast. Read more here Elsewhere, the UK's leadingsports bodies are backing ""vaccine passports"" and Covid testingas ""credible"" means of allowing full capacities at venues. In a letter to the leaders of the major political parties, they say a certification process could be beneficial ""in getting more fans safely back as quickly as possible"". However the group also warned that ""the final approach must not be discriminatory, should protect privacy, and have clear exit criteria."" Signatories include the Football Association, the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union, the All England Tennis Club at Wimbledon and Silverstone motor-racing circuit. As part of the government's reopening road map, from 17 May in England larger outdoor sports venues will be allowed to operate at up to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 10,000 spectators. People in Wales will be able to hit the gym and form extended households a week earlier than planned due to a drop in Covid cases, the Welsh government has confirmed. Gyms and leisure centres will be able to open from 3 May - instead of 10 May - while two households can bubble up to meet indoors from the same date. Wedding receptions outdoors for up to 30 people will be allowed in Wales from 26 April, also moving forward a week. But the dates for reopening the hospitality industry have not changed - pubs, cafes and restaurants will still be able to reopen outdoors from 26 April. Read all the detailshere. Here's what's happening around the world: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has reiterated his plan to drive down the cost of coronavirus PCR tests for travellers under the travel proposals. He tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he wants the tests to be ""as cheap and convenient as
possible"". ""Iâm going to work with the travel industry and the private
testing providers to drive down that cost,"" he says. ""I wonât spare those companies that seem to be profiteering - including even potentially removing them from the recommended list. ""I donât want to see people being ripped off."" He repeats that this is the first time he is not advising against people in England booking summer holidays abroad. ""For the first time there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he says. Germany has sparked controversy by launching talks over the Russian vaccine without waiting for coordinated EU action Russiahas askedSlovakiato return 200,000
doses of its Sputnik V vaccine which have sat in storage since they were
delivered on 1 March. Former Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic got hold of the doses secretly but then lost
his job last week over the controversy. Now Slovakiaâs drug
regulator says the doses are different to those reviewed positively by the
Lancet. Germanyhas started talks on buying the Sputnik drug, according toRussiaâssovereign wealth fund. TheEUâs medical agency EMAhasnât yet approved the vaccine and
Germanyâs health minister says purchase will be conditional on its approval. For the first time in eight days the number of Covid patients in
intensive care inFrancehas fallen, by 24 cases, to 5,705. A
big surge of infections was reported on Thursday, but that includes figures
from several days. Meanwhile, France has recorded its10 millionth Covid
vaccination and a record 437,000 were inoculated yesterday alone.Germanyâscase numbers have risen above 25,000 in the past 24 hours. The Netherlands and Portugal have joined several other countries in
limiting the Oxford-AstraZeneca drug to over-60s after the EMA advised of a
possible causal link with very rare blood clots. The agency is clear that the benefits outweigh
the risks. MeanwhileFranceâshealth minister says anyone under 55 who
has already had the first AZ dose will be offered another vaccine for the
second. Icelandis revising a new rule requiring anyone
arriving from a high-risk country to stay in a special quarantine hotel for five
days or submit a second negative test. The courts have ruled that the mandatory
hotel stay is illegal. The health minister says travellers wonât have to pay
for the hotel and will be allowed outdoors. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds says the government has not given enough detail about its traffic light travel system for it to be properly scrutinised by MPs. ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing,"" he tells BBC Breakfast. ""But I have no idea what the levels of each of those are, for the government to place countries into the green category, amber or red."" He says instead the information has been ""drip-fed into the media day-by-day"" and has been announced on a day when Parliament is not sitting. ""That's extremely frustrating,"" he says. At the moment, foreign holidays are banned, and returning travellers have toquarantineon arrival. Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reason currently faces a Â£5,000 fine. The earliest possible date for holidaying abroad has been given as 17 May - if the coronavirus situation allows it. For England, the government has yet to confirm travel can take place from that date. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume.

"Mr Kim made his rare admission of looming hardship at a party conference North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has told citizens to prepare for hard times ahead, following warnings from rights groups that the country faces dire food shortages and economic instability. Speaking at a party conference, Mr Kim appeared to compare the situation to the devastating 1990s famine, estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands. North Korea has shut its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trade with China, its economic lifeline, has come to a standstill. This is on top of existing international economic sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Imagine a North Korean family... North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis The South Koreans enslaved in the North's mines In a rare admission of looming hardship, the authoritarian leader of the single-party state on Thursday called on officials to ""wage another, more difficult 'Arduous March' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little"". The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country's struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death is not known, but estimates range up to 3 million. North Korea often struggles to feed its people ""It is not unusual for Kim Jong-un to talk about difficulties and hardship but this time the language is quite stark and that's different,"" Colin Zwirko, North Korea analyst at NK News, told the BBC. ""Last October for instance,he gave a speech where he said that he himself failed to bring about enough changes. But mentioning explicitly that he's decided to carry out a new Arduous March is not something he has said before."" Earlier this week, Mr Kim had warned the country faced the ""worst-ever situation"" and ""unprecedentedly numerous challenges"". There have been warnings for months that the people of North Korea are struggling. Reports of hardship appear to be coming especially from towns near the Chinese border, where smuggling would have been a huge earner for many. The price of corn, the staple diet for most of rural North Korea, has reportedly fluctuated enormously and at times a kilogram of corn has cost more than a month's wages. Lina Yoon, a researcher from Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a recent report,externalciting unnamed contacts in the country that ""there is barely any food going into the country from China"". ""There are so many more beggars, some people died from hunger in the border area, and there's no soap, toothpaste, or batteries,"" she wrote. What's it like to live in North Korea? Russians leave North Korea on hand-pushed trolley The UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, TomÃ¡s Ojea Quintana,warned last month in a report of a ""serious food crisis"",externalalready leading to malnourishment and starvation. ""Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them."" It is unclear whether any aid at all is currently coming into the country. North Korea has rejected offers of external aid and almost all diplomats and aid workers, including staff of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), have left. Meanwhile North Korea's border closures means trade with China dropped by 80% last year from levels that had already fallen significantly in 2018 when the UN expanded sanctions over North Korea's nuclear programme. Reports suggest North Korea restricted imports of staple foods from China last August and then cut almost all trade, including food and medicines, in October. The country has also ramped up punishments for smuggling, describing it as ""anti-socialist"" and ""enemy"" behaviour, according to HRW. North Korea was also hit by two major storms last summer, which caused flooding that is believed to have damaged crops, exacerbating the shortages. Kim Jong-un is shoring up support within his party as times get tough. He's making sure that the warnings are coming from him - perhaps so that when things get worse, he can point the finger at his officials for not acting on his orders. He can also pin blame for the dire economy on the Covid-19 pandemic and the strict economic sanctions designed to curb his nuclear weapons programme. And yet his regime continues to design and test new missiles. The weapons tests are something we can all see on satellite images and state media photos, and use them to question world leaders about how they are going to act. The North Korean people cannot get images of their suffering to us without the risk of being imprisoned or shot. Unseen, and according to warnings by their own leader, they now face going hungry amid a looming humanitarian crisis. Tightly controlled by the government, North Korea's economy is one of the least free in the world and is said to be highly inefficient. The enormous cost of maintaining the military and security structures has left very little for the ordinary North Korean. The almost complete border closure aims to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in a country that does not have the public health infrastructure to handle an outbreak. However there are indications that Pyongyang is feeling pressure to reopen borders at least a bit, Mr Zwirko said. ""North Korea has shown signs of wanting to increase trade with China again. They have passed a law a few months ago to help facilitate border trade,"" he said. ""But fundamentally, North Korea remains extremely paranoid about the virus. They'd really have to change and trust in the ability to disinfect goods that would come through."" North Korea claims that so far the border shutdown has kept it Covid-free, though analysts doubt this claim.

"The UK government gives more detail on its traffic light system for the resumption of overseas travel from England Travellers will need to pay for tests when departing and returning from abroad, including at least one PCR test Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the cost of Covid tests needs to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel sector Shapps also says he's not advising against people in England booking summer trips abroad It's still too early to say whether foreign holidays can resume on 17 May, he says, or which countries will be deemed to be safe Twice-weekly free rapid coronavirus tests are available to everyone in England from today Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab Brazil records more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant circulates Edited by Holly Wallis ITV presenter Kate Garraway's husband has returned home after more than a year in hospital being treated for Covid-19. Former political adviser Derek Draper, 53, was admitted in March last year with coronavirus symptoms, before having to be put into a coma. Garraway says he ""absolutely knew he was home"" but has not yet regained his speech and will require round-the-clock care. She and her young family all ""burst into tears"" when he arrived home. ""As we pulled up, I could see two little faces, Darcey and Billy [their children] looking out the window, and I could literally see them go, 'he's here,'"" she tells her Good Morning Britain colleagues. ""And they sort of ran out and ran forward, opened the door, and he immediately burst into tears. ""There was a lot of hugging and we got him inside."" Read more here While many sun-seekers are desperate for a foreign holiday, others have been unable to see family abroad for months because of travel restrictions. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent Today's report on international travel is not the grand reopening many in the industry wanted. There is real worry, particularly among lower cost carriers, that around Â£100 per person for a PCR test on return will dissuade travellers from booking, with many paying more for it than for their flights. But there are suggestions that the government has tried to address some of the concerns too. The introduction of a green watch list, to flag any countries potentially about to move from green to amber, is an attempt to avoid some of last year's confusion, as people rushed back to the UK before countries required quarantine. Nothing is guaranteed yet, but the government now says it will confirm whether or not international travel will restart on 17 May early next month. How early is the next question. Rob EnglandBBC News Dr Bennett-Richards said the rollout had been rewarding but challenging for GPs In the last four months, more than 50% of England's adult population have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine. In London's Tower Hamlets, that figure stands at 27% - but it doesn't tell the full story of the area's vaccine rollout. Initial low vaccination coverage was down to a combination of a young population, high infection rates in January and some hesitancy among residents, according to Dr Somen Banerjee, the borough's public health director. But Dr Phillip Bennett-Richards, a health worker and volunteer vaccinator, believes attitudes towards vaccines have changed among some patients in recent weeks. ""In addition to the younger, fitter cohorts, you're seeing older people coming in to get the vaccine who initially rejected it,"" he said, adding that he suspected they wanted to ""wait a month or so"" to learn more about potential side effects and others' experiences. And the vaccination gap between different ethnicities is narrowing in the borough: Dr Banerjee said when a clinic was held at the East London Mosque, the change in attitude was clear. ""The fact we had a vaccine centre in the mosque was an endorsement of it,"" he said. ""It was evident people were there that wouldn't have come otherwise."" Continue readinghere. We've just received some more reaction to the UK government's travel plan from holiday company Tui. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, says he is ""disappointed about the expensive testing and quarantine measures proposed"". ""We're firmly committed to finding cost effective testing solutions for our customers, as well as offering maximum flexibility, so we can make travel possible this summer and beyond,"" he says. Customers due to travel between 17 May and the end of July are  able to change their holiday to another date for free. Flintham says customers who are not able to quarantine on return, or pay for tests, are able to change their holiday to a later date. Greta Thunberg has told the BBC she does not plan to attend the UN climate conference due to be held in Glasgow this November, as she is concerned about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on attendance at COP26. The 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner believes the summit should be postponed. She says the UK government, which is hosting the summit, should wait until global vaccination rates have risen. The summit will bring together world leaders with the aim of agreeing a plan to tackle climate change. ""This needs to happen in the right way. Of course, the best thing to do would be to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible so that everyone could take part on the same terms,"" she said. Read more here. Victoria GillScience correspondent, BBC News Fish larvae use the sound of a healthy reef to find their way 'home' Ocean scientists around the world are studying the ""unique moment"" of quiet created by the pandemic in a vast listening experiment called ""the year of the quiet ocean"". ""Lockdown slowed global shipping on a scale that would otherwise be impossible,"" says Prof Peter Tyack from the University of St Andrews. The scientists plan to listen to the ocean soundscape before, during and after lockdown. The study will measure both how the pandemic briefly changed the ocean soundscape and how decades of increasing ocean noise has affected marine life. Activities like shipping, construction, military activity and undersea surveys for oil and gas, are all ""drowning out"" the healthy ocean soundscape,a review,externalfound recently. The impacts can be seen most dramatically in mass strandings of some species of deep-diving whales, which studies havelinked to the use of naval sonar,external. Read our full storyhere. On Thursday,Brazil recorded more than 4,000 Covid-related deaths in 24 hours for the first time, as a more contagious variant fuels a surge in cases. Hospitals are overcrowded, with people dying as they wait for treatment in some cities, and the health system is on the brink of collapse in many areas. The country's total death toll is now almost 337,000, second only to the US, and experts are warning the current surge in cases may not peak for several weeks. But President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose any lockdown measures to curb the outbreak. He argues that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself, and has tried to reverse some of the restrictions imposed by local authorities in the courts. He has consistently played down the severity of the virus, but he is now turning his focus to the nationwide vaccination drive which his critics say has come far too late. Read more here. Other travel industry bosses have been reacting to today's news from the government. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren says the requirement for PCR tests for passengers returning to England is ""a blow to all travellers"" and risks ""making flying only for the wealthy"". Consumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed -could cost about Â£120 per person.,external Mark Tanzer, boss of travel trade organisation Abta, says allowing the use of cheaper lateral flow tests would ""make international travel more accessible and affordable whilst still providing an effective mitigation against reimportation of the virus"". Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, says the announcement ""does not represent a reopening of travel as promised by ministers"". More industry reaction
to the UK governmentâs proposed travel plan has been coming in this morning. Jet2 has announced âwith
a heavy heartâ that it will suspend flights and holidays up to and including 23
June âbecause of the continued uncertainty that the [governmentâs] framework
providesâ. CEO Steve Heapy says he
is âextremely disappointed at the lack of clarity and detailâ in the overseas travel plan. It ""lacks any rigorous detail"" about how to get international travel going again and the framework ""is virtually the same as six months ago"", he says. Heapy adds that customers who are yet to travel and who are affected by this announcement will automatically have their booking cancelled with a full refund. ""Our team of travel experts will be in touch to help them to book their summer getaway for later in the year,"" he adds.  The Covid vaccine programme has prevented 10,400 deaths in the over 60s in England over the past four months, new analysis suggests. From the first jab on 8 December last year up to the end of March, more than 15 million jabs have been given to adults in this age group, Public Health England (PHE) said. According to its estimates, 9,100 deaths were prevented during that time in those aged 80 and over, 1,200 were avoided in those aged 70 to 79, and 100 lives were saved in those aged 60 to 69. The figures were estimated using real-world data on how effective the vaccines
are at preventing death and vaccine uptake. PHE said there was now increasing
evidence that vaccines helped to reduce transmission, therefore it was likely that
an even higher number of deaths would have been avoided by the vaccine programme. As India grapples with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections - with an average of more than 90,000 cases daily from 1 April - its vaccination drive appears to be struggling. Half a dozen states are reporting ashortage of doses,externaleven as the federal government insists that there's enough in stock. In the western state of Maharashtra, which is reporting more than half of India's new infections, the inoculation programme appears to be grinding to a halt. The local government says its current stock of 1.5 million doses will last only for three days. Vaccination centres have been shut in the state capital, Mumbai, and parts of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. ""If the vaccines don't come in three days, we will be forced to stop the drive,"" state Health Minister Rajesh Tope told reporters. Read more here. Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab. During Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. Islamic teaching says Muslims should refrain ""from anything entering the body"" between sunrise and sunset. But Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast. Read more here Elsewhere, the UK's leadingsports bodies are backing ""vaccine passports"" and Covid testingas ""credible"" means of allowing full capacities at venues. In a letter to the leaders of the major political parties, they say a certification process could be beneficial ""in getting more fans safely back as quickly as possible"". However the group also warned that ""the final approach must not be discriminatory, should protect privacy, and have clear exit criteria."" Signatories include the Football Association, the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union, the All England Tennis Club at Wimbledon and Silverstone motor-racing circuit. As part of the government's reopening road map, from 17 May in England larger outdoor sports venues will be allowed to operate at up to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 10,000 spectators. People in Wales will be able to hit the gym and form extended households a week earlier than planned due to a drop in Covid cases, the Welsh government has confirmed. Gyms and leisure centres will be able to open from 3 May - instead of 10 May - while two households can bubble up to meet indoors from the same date. Wedding receptions outdoors for up to 30 people will be allowed in Wales from 26 April, also moving forward a week. But the dates for reopening the hospitality industry have not changed - pubs, cafes and restaurants will still be able to reopen outdoors from 26 April. Read all the detailshere. Here's what's happening around the world: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has reiterated his plan to drive down the cost of coronavirus PCR tests for travellers under the travel proposals. He tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he wants the tests to be ""as cheap and convenient as
possible"". ""Iâm going to work with the travel industry and the private
testing providers to drive down that cost,"" he says. ""I wonât spare those companies that seem to be profiteering - including even potentially removing them from the recommended list. ""I donât want to see people being ripped off."" He repeats that this is the first time he is not advising against people in England booking summer holidays abroad. ""For the first time there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he says. Germany has sparked controversy by launching talks over the Russian vaccine without waiting for coordinated EU action Russiahas askedSlovakiato return 200,000
doses of its Sputnik V vaccine which have sat in storage since they were
delivered on 1 March. Former Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic got hold of the doses secretly but then lost
his job last week over the controversy. Now Slovakiaâs drug
regulator says the doses are different to those reviewed positively by the
Lancet. Germanyhas started talks on buying the Sputnik drug, according toRussiaâssovereign wealth fund. TheEUâs medical agency EMAhasnât yet approved the vaccine and
Germanyâs health minister says purchase will be conditional on its approval. For the first time in eight days the number of Covid patients in
intensive care inFrancehas fallen, by 24 cases, to 5,705. A
big surge of infections was reported on Thursday, but that includes figures
from several days. Meanwhile, France has recorded its10 millionth Covid
vaccination and a record 437,000 were inoculated yesterday alone.Germanyâscase numbers have risen above 25,000 in the past 24 hours. The Netherlands and Portugal have joined several other countries in
limiting the Oxford-AstraZeneca drug to over-60s after the EMA advised of a
possible causal link with very rare blood clots. The agency is clear that the benefits outweigh
the risks. MeanwhileFranceâshealth minister says anyone under 55 who
has already had the first AZ dose will be offered another vaccine for the
second. Icelandis revising a new rule requiring anyone
arriving from a high-risk country to stay in a special quarantine hotel for five
days or submit a second negative test. The courts have ruled that the mandatory
hotel stay is illegal. The health minister says travellers wonât have to pay
for the hotel and will be allowed outdoors. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds says the government has not given enough detail about its traffic light travel system for it to be properly scrutinised by MPs. ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing,"" he tells BBC Breakfast. ""But I have no idea what the levels of each of those are, for the government to place countries into the green category, amber or red."" He says instead the information has been ""drip-fed into the media day-by-day"" and has been announced on a day when Parliament is not sitting. ""That's extremely frustrating,"" he says. At the moment, foreign holidays are banned, and returning travellers have toquarantineon arrival. Anyone in England who travels abroad without good reason currently faces a Â£5,000 fine. The earliest possible date for holidaying abroad has been given as 17 May - if the coronavirus situation allows it. For England, the government has yet to confirm travel can take place from that date. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has saidit would be ""premature""to book a foreign summer trip.

"This video can not be played Chris Gentile said his coach company is one of many choosing to delay foreign trips Some coach companies have said they will not run international trips this year, even if lockdown rules change to allow it. Voel Coaches, based in Denbighshire, normally offers them but said it had already decided to cancel. It said other coach operators across the UK it had spoken to were making the same decision. Under current lockdown restrictions it isillegal to travel abroad,externalfrom anywhere in the UK for a holiday. There is currently no date for when people in Wales will be able to travel abroad for leisure. The Denbighshire-based company does not plan to run trips abroad until 2022 Voel has a fleet of 38 coaches and during the summer season around half of the holidays it offers would involve trips abroad. Marketing manager Chris Gentile said: ""No matter what happens at this time, we will not be changing our mind"" and that ""if the government had been very clear, in their guidance, from day one, things could have been different"". When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? 'Stay-local' rule in Wales to end from Saturday He said that if the company did take customers overseas and there were rule changes, then it ""would open us up to some great risks"" having to get a coach full of passengers back to Wales. When Covid first hit last year one of its coaches was in Spain and ""had literally hours to get across the border"", he said. He said he had been in contact with a number of other coach tour operators throughout the UK and many of them had made a similar decision not to run foreign holidays this year because ""there's too much of a risk"". ""We're an industry that's been affected really bad and I don't think the risks really add up to even attempting that - I don't think it's the right thing to do."" Mr Gentile said it would be March next year before the company looked at offering holidays overseas again, which means it will also be missing out on taking passengers abroad for the next ski season. Ann Jones says Covid restrictions may bring younger people back to traditional travel agents One travel agent said many people were being cautious when it comes to booking holidays abroad in the summer months. Ann Jones from Teithiau Menai Travel in Caernarfon said booking inquiries had been ""fluctuating"" in recent months and many customers were looking beyond this summer for a trip abroad. She said she had been rescheduling holidays ""sometimes for a third time"" and it was ""very complicated"" because of uncertainty caused by Covid restrictions. ""It's a lot of hard work and especially when you have no income coming in for it because we in travel don't get a penny for working until people actually go on their holidays,"" she said. But she believed the complications involved in trying to arrange overseas travel could be a boost to bring customers back to traditional travel agents - particularly for younger people who would normally book online. ""They've found that they haven't been able to contact anyone, speak to anyone, talk about the refunds or moving their holidays,"" she said. What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

"Sir Richard Sutton and his family's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man arrested on suspicion of murder after one of the UK's richest men was found stabbed to death remains in hospital with injuries, police said. Sir Richard Sutton, 83, was pronounceddead at his mansion near Gillingham, Dorset, at 21:15 BST on Wednesday. A woman, in her 60s and believed to be his wife, was also stabbed and remains in a critical condition.

Dorset Police said a 34-year-old man who was arrested following the stabbing was continuing to receive hospital treatment for injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening. The suspect, from Gillingham, and the victims were known to each other. He was arrested after being stopped in a vehicle in Hammersmith, London, and was taken to hospital. A cordon remains in place at Sir Richard's Dorset property and police have appealed for information. Dorset Police said the victim and the arrested man were known to each other Sir Richard, who was number 435 in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, owned several top hotels and had a large property and farming portfolio. He owned the freehold of the Sheraton Grand London Park Lane and the Athenaeum Hotel in Mayfair.

"This video can not be played Who bought Lil Nas X $1,000 'Satan shoe'? Nike says the art collective which made ""Satan Shoes"" that purportedly contain a drop of human blood in the soles has agreed to issue a voluntary recall as part of a legal settlement. The $1,018 (Â£740) trainers are modified Nike Air Max 97s. Only 666 pairs were made and all but one have been shipped. The collective MSCHF will offer full refunds to customers in order to remove the shoes from circulation, Nike said. The settlement resolves a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Nike. The controversial shoes were produced by the Brooklyn collective in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X, who held the last pair so he could choose the recipient. MSCHF said it would keep the final pair of shoes. No further details were made public about the settlement, which includes the Jesus Shoes produced by MSCHF in 2019 also using the Air Max 97 as a base. ""MSCHF altered these shoes without Nike's authorisation. Nike had nothing to do with the Satan Shoes or the Jesus Shoes,"" Nike said in a statement. Limited edition shoes can fetch higher prices among collectors so it is not clear how many - if any - customers will return the products. Nike wins court bid to halt sale of 'Satan Shoes' Nike sues over 'Satan Shoes' with human blood Nike sued MSCHF last week claiming the ""Satan Shoes [were] likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association"" between MSCHF's products and the company. But MSCHF said the shoes were ""individually-numbered works of art"" and did not sow confusion. Siding with Nike, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order last Thursday. Lil Nas X and MSCHF's Satan Shoes sold out in less than a minute David Bernstein, from the intellectual property litigation group at Debevoise & Plimpton and a representative for MSCHF, said the artistic messages the collective hoped to convey were ""dramatically amplified"" by the lawsuit. ""MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance,"" he said in a statement as news of the settlement emerged, adding that MSCHF was ""pleased to have resolved the lawsuit"". MSCHF sold the black and red shoes in less than a minute last week. It coincided with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which had debuted on YouTube days earlier. The song features the rapper, who came out as gay in 2019, celebrating his sexuality and rejecting attempts to shame him. In a heavily stylised music video, he slides down a pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snaps his neck and steals his horns. The imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - ""So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'.""

"The US has blacklisted seven Chinese groups it accuses of building supercomputers to help its military. It is the first move by the Biden administration to make it harder for China to obtain US technology On Thursday, three companies and four branches of China's National Supercomputing Center were added to theUS blacklist,external. This bars American companies from exporting technology to the groups without proper approval. World's fastest supercomputer fights coronavirus Tech Tent: Is Arm the future of computing? Too many computer chips made in Asia - Intel chief The US commerce department said the groups were involved in building supercomputers used by Chinese ""military actors"" and facilitating programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction. The sanctioned groups are leading China's supercomputing development and are key players in Beijing's plan for chip self-sufficiency. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the Biden administration would use ""the full extent of its authorities to prevent China from leveraging US technologies to support these destabilising military modernisation efforts"". This video can not be played What is quantum computing? The Trump administration had also targeted dozens of Chinese companies it suspected of using American technology for military uses, including phonemaker Huawei. Mr Biden's move on Thursday requires the seven Chinese groups to obtain licences to access American technologies, including chip infrastructures designed by Intel and other U.S chipmakers. While the blacklist bars US-based companies from providing services and products to the Chinese firms, it doesn't bar those that are produced in facilities outside of the US. One such company is TSMC, the Taiwan-based company that has become the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturer. Supercomputers have a considerably higher level of performance compared to a general-purpose computer and can make billions of calculations per second. Supercomputers are made up of thousands of connected processors and are used for functions like forecasting weather and climate trends, simulating nuclear tests and for pharmaceutical research. They are also necessary for the development of advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles. ""Supercomputing capabilities are vital for the development of many - perhaps almost all - modern weapons and national security systems, such as nuclear weapons and hypersonic weapons,"" Ms  Raimondo added. The US is worried about China gaining access to American technology that helps its army close the gap with the US military. The Biden administration is currently reviewing dozens of China-related actions that Donald Trump took, including an order that prohibits Americans from investing in Chinese companies believed to be linked to the military. ""Do you think China is waiting around to invest in its digital infrastructure or research and development? I promise you, they are not waiting,"" Mr Biden said in a speech on Wednesday. Mr Biden said China and the rest of the world ""are racing ahead of us in the investments they have in the future"".

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The tests are coming out too expensive, we are trying to drive that down."" People in England can start thinking about booking foreign holidays again this summer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. But he said the cost of the Covid tests required needed to be driven down, amid criticism from the travel industry. Mr Shapps has also given more detail on the traffic light system which will see countries graded on their risk. Passengers will have to take the tests before leaving and on returning - even from low-risk ""green"" countries. There will also be a watch list for countries most at risk of going from green to amber to provide greater assurance for those looking to travel abroad. When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Which countries are on the UK's travel ban list? Announcing thefindings of the Global Travel Taskforce,externalset up by the government to examine how leisure travel could be reopened safely after lockdown, Mr Shapps said foreign holidays would resume on 17 May at the earliest. He told the BBC: ""This is the first time I'm able to come on and say I'm not advising against booking foreign holidays. ""Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. ""But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place."" Mr Shapps said the use of PCR tests - those needing to be sent to a lab - enabled scientists to detect potential variants of concern. But he said he was ""concerned"" about the cost of the tests, adding that the government was committed to driving down the price of these by working with the private sector. The transport secretary also said the government was looking at the possibility of people bringing pre-departure tests with them that they can use before boarding their return flight, pointing out that people are now able to order free lateral flow tests. On Friday,the UK confirmed another 3,150 virus cases,external, and another 60 deaths of people who had tested positive in the past 28 days. Mr Shapps said countries would be categorised based on level of infections and vaccinations, variants of concern and the quality of their genetic sequencing. He said this list would be kept under constant review and that he was hopeful European countries would be upgraded as their vaccination rates improve. Mr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. The government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. Nearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK. The earliest date holidays abroad could be allowed under the current roadmap out of lockdown is 17 May The rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said. Further formal reviews will take place at ""checkpoints"" no later than 31 July and 1 October. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. He told the BBC: ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red."" The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be ""premature"" to book a foreign summer trip. In other developments: People in England can now order free lateral flow tests, as the governmentencourages people to get into the habit of testing themselves twice a week,external Gyms will be allowed to reopen and people will be able to form extended householdsa week earlier than planned in Wales At the moment, almost anyone seeking to travel to Englandmust first take a coronavirus test,externalbefore departure and then two tests when they arrive, bought through a private provider.

Consumer group Which? estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed -could cost about Â£120 per person.,external However, the government said it would work with airlines, travel firms and the test providers to see whether prices can be reduced.

The government's plans have been met with mixed reaction from the travel industry.

"Boris Johnson says any testing regime for international travel should be easy and cheap, after the boss of EasyJet criticised new government plans. The prime minister also said vaccine passports would be a ""fact of life"" for people travelling internationally in future. The government hopes to reopen international travel on 17 May, but is yet to make a final decision. However, the prime minister said he had ""not given up"" on the idea. Under plans outlined on Sunday, destinations would be classed as green, amber or red based on their Covid infection rates and vaccination coverage. No isolation would be necessary on return to the UK from green countries, but pre-departure and post-arrival tests would be required, potentially costing up to Â£200 each. EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren But earlier on Tuesday, EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren told the BBC this would make travel too expensive, with the tests costing as much or more than a flight in some cases. Asked about the comments, and whether cheaper lateral flow tests could replace PCR tests in the plans, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I do think we want to make things as easy as we possibly can. ""The boss of EasyJet is right to focus on this issue, we're going to see what we can do to make things as flexible and as affordable as possible."" Mr Lundgren told the BBC that if costs were not reduced, the government ""wouldn't open up international travel for everyone, but only those who can afford it. ""If you are ticking all of those boxes to become a green destinationâ¦ [multiple tests] don't make sense to me and it would add to cost and complexities."" 'Disappointed' travel chiefs seek clarity from PM When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Scientists and ministers recently warnedthat holidays to destinations such as France, where Covid cases are rising, are ""unlikely"". But Mr Johnson said he ""had not given up"" on the idea that non-essential foreign travel could begin again on 17 May. This video can not be played How one airline is keeping its aircraft and staff ready to fly However,other travel industry figures called for clarityfollowing the prime minister's latest announcement on lockdown restrictions easing. The Business Travel Association said the announcement was ""beyond disappointing"" and called for ""a clear pathway to international travel and trade"". Its chief executive, Clive Wratten, said moves to open borders had ""once again been kicked down the road"". ""The business travel industry continues to be crippled by today's lack of movement,"" he added. The boss of travel firm Thomas Cook, Alan French, also told the BBC's Wake Up to Money that a lack of clarity around what type of tests might be required for passengers and when they would need to be taken was a let-down. He said that overall, there were ""glimmers of good news"", in that the earliest date for travel resuming on 17 May was not pushed back. ""But actually, the details were missing and that was disappointing,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Johnson said he did not want to see coronavirus re-imported from abroad and urged people to wait for a report from the Global Travel Taskforce on 12 April. But Gemma Antrobus, owner of independent travel company Haslemere Travel, warned that business owners like herself faced a difficult path. ""Disappointed is putting it mildly. Where we hoped confidence would start to pick up, and more people would be interested in booking holidaysâ¦ that just won't come this week."" She added that some customers had now moved bookings for holidays five times amid changing restrictions. ""Every week we don't have that confidence from consumers, business owners like myself just wonder what lies ahead.""

Mr Shapps also said he was concerned about people who were separated from family members living overseas, saying it was ""possibly even more pressing than the holiday issue"". He said families in the UK were ""uniquely spread across the world"", and the government wanted to make sure people were able to reunite. The government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do so by early May. Nearly 40 countries are currently on the UK government's red list of countries from which travel is banned, except for British and Irish nationals and those with residence rights in the UK. The earliest date holidays abroad could be allowed under the current roadmap out of lockdown is 17 May The rules will be reviewed on 28 June to see whether any measures can be rolled back, the government said. Further formal reviews will take place at ""checkpoints"" no later than 31 July and 1 October. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the government had not outlined the traffic light system in detail and criticised the release of the plans while MPs are not sitting. He told the BBC: ""The government has spoken about factors like vaccination rates, infection rates, the position with variants and also about the level of genomic sequencing. But I've no idea what the levels of each of those are for the government to place countries into, whether it's the green category, amber or red."" The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have both already argued that 17 May will be too early for foreign holidays to resume. Northern Ireland has not yet announced its plans, but its chief medical officer has said it would be ""premature"" to book a foreign summer trip.
