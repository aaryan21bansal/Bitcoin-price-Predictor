"The Killers say they have found no evidence to support ""heartbreaking"" allegations of sexual assault by members of their road crew in 2009. The band's legal team set up an investigation last week, following an account by their former sound engineer. She alleged hearing crew members boast of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in a dressing room in Milwaukee. After speaking to her, as well as venue staff and the alleged victim, they found ""no corroboration"" of the claims. However, the band requested that anyone with further information about the allegations should contact them; and said they would establish a new system for reporting assault or bullying on future tours. Some readers may find the following information distressing. If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story,these organisations may be able to help. The claims emerged last week, in a blog posted by Chez Cherrie, who worked with The Killers briefly in 2009. She wrote that, during a show at the the Rave/Eagles Ballroom in Milwaukee, the front of house engineer told the crew that there was ""a girl set up in Dressing Room A,"" and crew members could put their name on a list to be called ""when it's [their] turn."" Cherrie said that later, on the bus, members of the crew would ""swap stories"" about their time with the woman. ""They talked about her intoxication level, yet had no qualms that she was obviously blacked out, or close to it,"" she added. As they were departing, she claimed a security guard ran towards the bus and said: ""That girl in Dressing Room A is passed out and naked. Is anyone going to take care of her?"" She alleged that the men on the bus laughed and declined, before leaving the venue. Cherrie did not name the band in the article, which was first published in 2018, but identified them as The Killers while re-posting the article on Twitter last week. None of the band members were implicated in the alleged assault. In a separate allegation, however, Cherrie claimed the band ""would bring drunken groupies to our bus"" and that the crew were given bonuses if they took women backstage who were willing to perform oral sex or shower naked for un-named band-members. The Killers to investigate tour misconduct claims In response, the band told the BBC they were ""shocked and astonished"" by the allegations. Although the incident had not been reported to the police, they asked their legal firm, Reynolds & Associates, to investigate the allegations. In a lengthy statement shared with the BBC on Monday, the legal team summarised their findings, concluding that the ""accusations of sexual misconduct and a sexual assault backstage... were discovered to be entirely unfounded"". They confirmed that Chez Cherrie had worked on the tour for three weeks in April 2009, and ""received much of the information she shared from a second or third hand source"". ""She confirmed that she did not witness the alleged events herself,"" the statement continued. One of the biggest bands in rock music, The Killers have headlined Glastonbury twice It was established that a front of house engineer was identified by several crew members as ""a problematic workmate"" whose ""sexist remarks and rude comments"" towards Cherrie, as well as his treatment of others on the tour, ""was frequently deemed unfair by those who witnessed it"". This employee, who no longer works for the band, was thought to be the person who made the radio transmissions about a ""line up"" in ""Dressing Room A"", according to several crew members. However, they characterised the comments as an ""attempt at a joke or a 'hazing',"" while others recalled that ""vulgar language"" and ""crass jokes"" were sometimes overheard on the tour. Regarding the alleged assault, staff at the venue noted ""that dressing rooms are not, and have never been, labelled alphabetically, and at that time the dressing rooms were interconnected and without doors"". The catering team also asserted that ""at no point did they see or hear of a drunk or naked woman in any dressing room"" and that such an incident would have been raised with the security team. The legal team also said they were able to trace ""via touring records"" the alleged victim of the incident, who had been given ""aftershow"" passes by the front of house engineer, and interviewed her as part of their investigation. ""The guest in question confirmed that she and her friend were backstage after the show, did not witness any 'train' or 'line-up,' nor were they left behind in the dressing rooms at the venue,"" the statement said. ""She stated that she and the same friend attended 2009 Lollapalooza festival later that year on the band's production guest list."" The investigation also stated that ""it was not verified but assessed as feasible"" that Cherrie was party to discussions about receiving bonuses for supplying women, but that such conversations did not come from ""any of the musicians"" or tour management. It suggested that comments of this nature were an in-joke, based upon ""urban legends"" about touring life; and found no evidence of a band member ever spending time on the crew bus. While the allegations could not be corroborated, the band expressed ""great regret"" that Cherrie ""felt she had nowhere to turn with her concerns at the time"". ""The band believe there should always be an easy way to report a situation that is concerning to anyone on the road with them, no matter their status or how briefly they are joining for,"" their lawyers said. ""They expressed regret that the temporary crew member was made to feel unsafe and bullied during her brief time with the band and understand that it is not always feasible for touring crew to raise concerns with their immediate superiors."" To that end, the band said they would make available an ""off-site independent HR contact"" for all staff on future tours, with whom they could raise any concerns anonymously. The statement ended: ""The Killers would like to take this opportunity to assure their fans - and the families of their current crew - that their tours are a safe, familial and professional working environment."" In response, Cherrie said she was grateful that the band had ""taken my experience seriously"" and that she was ""beyond relieved"" they had been able to find the alleged victim, who ""is reportedly fine"". However, she told the BBC she had ""conflicting feelings"" about some of the investigation's other findings, including ""generalised statements"" that she ""didn't agree with"". The sound engineer added that the vulgarity and lewd humour she witnessed on tour reflected ""a larger issue in this industry - that 'hazing' towards the only women on the technical crew was normal, expected, accepted and not questioned by anyone, including myself. ""I hope that this moment is a learning experience for the entire industry and that we are able to come together in comprehensive manner to have these discussions that are so long overdue."" Welcoming The Killers' own initiatives, she added: ""I hope that we are able to work together to develop a framework of reporting mistreatment and harassment that protects workers and fans and demands accountability of the people in power.""

"The government has urged pharmaceutical firms to have six weeks' worth of drugs stockpiled, in readiness for the end of the Brexit transition period. In a letter to medical suppliers, the Department of Health said there would be no extension to the transition period after 31 December. The department acknowledged that global supply chains were under pressure because of the coronavirus crisis. But it said having reserve stocks would provide a buffer against disruption. ""To build upon past work and ensure a co-ordinated approach, we will be asking suppliers to confirm their contingency plans for the end of the [transition period],"" the department's letter said. The call from the government comes amid continued uncertainty about what form the UK's relationship with the EU will take after the transition period ends. UK post-Brexit drug stockpiles at risk amid virus No-deal Brexit: Drug supply plans not yet clear Coronavirus vaccine: UK signs deal with GSK and Sanofi Last month, after informal talks in London, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said""significant divergences"" remained between the EU and the UKon a post-Brexit trade deal. The UK has ruled out extending the 31 December deadline to reach a deal. The government asked medical firms to consider avoiding sending supplies on short routes across the Channel, such as from Dover and Folkestone to Calais and Dunkirk. Its letter also pointed out that regardless of whether the UK and the EU reach an agreement, the government plans to bring in new border controls in three stages, concluding in July next year. In June, the pharmaceutical industry warned the government thatsome stockpiles of medical supplies had been ""used up entirely""by coronavirus. Drugmakers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again in time, if the UK should fail to strike a deal with the EU. The pharmaceutical industry advised that the government would need to buy and store a longer and much broader list of medicines, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year. Drugmakers also urged the government to ensure that alternative supply routes were put in place to ensure that goods could continue to flow uninterrupted across borders.

"DW Sports, a gym and sports retailer, has said it will enter administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk. The company, founded by former Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan, operated 73 gyms and 75 stores across the UK. All of its stores are to close, but DW said it would work with administrators BDO to save as many gyms as possible. Fitness First and its 43 gyms, which are part of the same group of companies, will not be affected, the firm said. Aviation and gyms 'ignored' by government ""As a consequence of Covid-19, we found ourselves in a position where we were mandated by government to close down both our retail store portfolio and our gym chain in its entirety for a protracted period, leaving us with a high fixed-cost base and zero income,"" chief executive Martin Long said. ""The decision to appoint administrators has not been taken lightly but will give us the best chance to protect viable parts of the business, return them to profitability, and secure as many jobs as possible."" Administrator BDO said its aim was to try and sell as ""much of DW Sports' business as can be achieved."" DW Sports had already closed 25 of its stores, and the firm said its remaining 50 retail sites would ""all be moving into closing down sales from today"". The DW Sports website will cease trading with immediate effect. The company said 59 of its gyms in England and Northern Ireland have reopened, while 14 are in areas restricted by localised lockdowns and are closed. Mr Long told the BBC in April that the firm's income normally totals around Â£15m a month, but that it had fallen to zero, overnight, while it still had a Â£3m monthly wage bill. Administrators BDO said gym members should contact their local gym for further information, or call the DWS Customer Service centre on 01942 311215. Creditors can register claims by emailing DWS@bdo.co.uk What's most worrying about the decision by DW sports is that its problems are far from being confined to itself: among non-food retailers, they're almost universal. They've had to deal with months when lots of money was going out (high fixed costs like rent, rates and wages) and zero money was coming in. And as DW's chief executive Martin Long points out, this government-ordered lockdown has made it ""difficult for any business to manage without long-term damage"". That's the worry - that DW's misfortune may reflect that of most of the consumer-facing sector of the economy. All retailers have been looking carefully at sales and costs since lockdown was eased and at whether any 'bounce-back' is strong and sustained enough. Clearly for DW, founded in the 1970s as JJB, it isn't. Nor was it enough for any potential buyer to be prepared to risk taking over the business as a whole. It won't be the last retail business to exhaust options, come to the same reluctant conclusion and call in administrators. The news followed Monday's announcement that HSBC is speeding up its 35,000 job losses and Friday's Byron Burger news it is axing 650 jobs and closing more than half its outlets. The number of jobs being lost because of the coronavirus crisis is accelerating, with an estimated 150,000 redundancies so far. Last week's bad news included 450 jobs disappearing at Selfridges, 650 at busmaker Alexander Dennis, 900 at Dyson, and 1,200 workers facing redundancy at the National Trust. Other lay-offs announced during the pandemic have included: Up to 5,000 job cuts at Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin 1,900 jobs at CafÃ© Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group 1,000 jobs at Pret A Manger 1,700 UK jobs at plane-maker Airbus 1,300 crew and 727 pilots at EasyJet 550 jobs are going at Daily Mirror publisher Reach Mr Long spoke out about the ""limited support"" DW Sports had. ""It is a difficult model for any business to manage through without long-term damage, and with the limited support which we have been able to gain,"" he said. ""Having exhausted all other available options for the business, we firmly believe that this process can be a platform to restructure the business and preserve many of our gyms for our members, and also protect the maximum number of jobs possible for our team members.""

"Bytedance is weighing up whether to base its TikTok app in London An influential backbench MP has called on the government to carry out a security review of TikTok before its Chinese owner decides whether to base the app in the UK. Neil O'Brien - co-founder of the China Research Group of Tory MPs - said the intelligence services should publish a report into the matter. President Trump is threatening to ban TikTok in the US. This has forced the app to ditch plans to establish its headquarters there. TikTok had been expected to pick California or New York - where it already has offices - after appointing an American ex-Disney executive as its chief executive in May. However, the US president has since given it an ultimatum to sell its local business to an American firm. ""I set a date of around 15 September, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States... unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal,"" said Donald Trump on Monday. He added that ""a very substantial portion of that price"" should go to the US Treasury ""because we're making it possible for this deal to happen"". Microsoft has confirmed it is in talks to buy TikTok's service in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - all the members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, except the UK. The app's Chinese parent company Bytedance has confirmed this had forced a rethink. This video can not be played WATCH: What's going on with TikTok? ""In light of the current situation, Bytedance has been evaluating the possibility of establishing TikTok's headquarters outside of the US, to better serve our global users,"" it said in a brief statement. The Sun newspaperhad reported on the weekend that the UK government,externalhad already approved TikTok setting up its HQ in London, and an announcement would be made this week. However a source told the BBC that Bytedance had yet to make a final decision, although London was on a short list of possibilities. Dublin and Singapore have been reported to be the other options. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said any decision would be a ""commercial one"" taken by Bytedance, and added that Boris Johnson had not discussed the issue with President Trump. The China Research Group represents a group of about 50 MPs who are concerned about Beijing's influence in the UK. It previously helped pressure the government into a rethink on Huawei, and has also raised concerns about plans to let Chinese companies invest in UK nuclear power stations. Neil O'Brien co-founded the China Research Group with fellow Tory MP Tom Tugendhat in April Mr O'Brien said he was not opposed in principle to the idea of TikTok being based in London, but said a ""deep dive"" into its code should be carried out first. ""It would be useful for the government to use the kind of specialists in cyber-security that only it has access to, to give us a definitive view of whether the app is safe,"" he told the BBC. ""[If it is] we should welcome investment by TikTok in the country. ""But if there are problems, as some media reports have suggested, with either political interference in its algorithms and the content that's shown, or about where the data is ending up and a lack of security - well that would raise a whole bunch of other questions."" Beyond TikTok: Who else might President Trump ban? How would the US go about banning TikTok? Microsoft and TikTok talks continue after Trump call However, another prominent Tory backbencher has taken a tougher line. The Times reports that Sir Iain Duncan Smith,external, who chairs the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: ""We are playing silly games over this, trying to persuade ourselves that we are able to run a risk-free involvement with these companies. Bytedance is every bit as unreliable as Huawei."" TikTok has said that it strictly abides by local laws. It currently stores data from its international users on servers based in the US and Singapore. This keeps it separate from that of users in mainland China, who use TikTok's sister app Douyin. While the government has not commented on a security review, as a matter of course GCHQ looks into any cyber-issue flagged as a national security threat  by the US. Two points are believed to be of particular concern to the agency. Firstly, whether Chinese spies could get access to the geo-location data - including GPS coordinates and internet addresses - logged by the app. Secondly, the degree to which the app could be subverted to push certain political content at users. While TikTok says it would not send international users' data back to China, there is concern it would be compelled to do so if Beijing invoked its National Intelligence Law. It obligates Chinese citizens to ""support, assist and cooperate"" with the country's intelligence services and to keep such activity secret. Such concerns have to be weighed against the prestige of hosting TikTok's headquarters, and the degree to which doing so might help repair relations with Beijing following a ban of the use of Huawei's 5G kit. ""If TikTok decided to base its new HQ in London, it would certainly cement it as a global tech hub,"" commented Chloe Colliver from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue think tank. ""There are already some very prominent start-ups, but TikTok is one of the fastest growing tech companies in the world.""

"Andrea Charles Fidelis said police presumed she was guilty because of her race Police have apologised to a black civil servant who was accused of being a car thief while jogging near her home. Dr Andrea Charles Fidelis, who works for the Ministry of Justice, said she was racially profiled and ""dehumanised"" by an officer in Swanley, Kent. She was ""threatened with arrest"" after a man claimed to have seen her leaving his driveway on 29 March, she said. Kent Police said claims the officer had been ""biased and discriminatory"" were not upheld by an investigation. But the force said it had apologised to Dr Charles Fidelis ""for the way the officer had spoken to her"". Dr Charles Fidelis, 41, said she had sought sanctuary in a railway station after being followed while jogging by a man who mistakenly believed she had attempted to steal his car. When police arrived, an officer presumed she was guilty without asking any questions and did not believe her account that she was in fear of being attacked by the man, she said. ""I was dismissed by him as not having the capacity to have natural human feelings,"" she added. The findings of Kent Police's inquiry, shared with Dr Charles Fidelis, said there was no evidence of ""discrimination or incivility"" and the officer had not breached the force's policy or the law. A report said the information available to the officer at the time was ""sufficient to identify Dr Charles Fidelis as a suspect"". She said the force had failed to take account of the ""engrained"" racial bias of the officer, who had been ""unable to empathise or even see me as a potential victim"". ""Throughout this whole saga I have not been treated equally to my white accuser,"" she wrote in a blog. ""The embodiment of black people being seen first as criminals, rather than victims has played out at every stage from start to finish."" The experience left her feeling ""brutalised"" and ""frightened to go out"", she said. The mother of three, who sits on the board of a violence reduction charity, said she had been aware of a ""deeply held resentment in the black community towards policing"", but had previously had a ""really positive experience with the police"". However, her treatment had provided a ""painful insight into how it plays out"", she said. Kent Police said it ""takes all complaints relating to racial discrimination seriously"". It said Dr Charles Fidelis had ""appealed against the outcome of the complaint and this is now in the hands of the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) to allow the matter to be considered independently"". The IOPC said it was assessing the appeal.

"This video can not be played Hays Travel founders tell 5 Live why theyâre having to lay off hundreds of staff The firm which bought Thomas Cook shops has said up to 878 employees out of 4,500 may lose their jobs because of new coronavirus travel restrictions. Hays Travel took on more than 2,000 former Thomas Cook employees when it went bust in October last year. Owners John and Irene Hays said Spanish travel restrictions meant hundreds of thousands of holidays were cancelled. They were ""devastated"" staff would lose jobs ""through no fault of their own"", the couple said. In a joint statement, the Hays said they had ""made every possible effort"" to protect the jobs of all the firm's staff, ""including those who were employed when Hays Travel took on the Thomas Cook shops last October"". The Sunderland-based company said it was now consulting with 344 staff training as travel consultants and the 534 who work in the foreign exchange division. The firm said its experienced travel sales staff, apprentices and other head office staff were not affected by the cuts. ""We are devastated that after all of our efforts and the huge investment we've made, we now face losing some of our valued employees, through no fault of their own. ""Following the decision to ban travel to Spain and the changes in furlough conditions coming at the same time, we have had no choice,"" the firm added. In July, the governmentbrought back a 14-day quarantine for travellersreturning to the UK from Spain after a spike in coronavirus cases. The Foreign Office laterupdated its advice against all non-essential travel to Spainto include the Balearic and Canary Islands as well as the mainland. And firms who have furloughed staff during the pandemichad to start contributing to the government job retention scheme from Saturday, putting more pressure on struggling companies. Mrs Hays told the BBC it was ""impossible to overstate the importance of Spain"" on the company's business. Mr Hays said the firm disagreed with the government's approach to quarantining Spain: ""Other parts of Spain, on the Costa Del Sol, the islands, Majorca, Tenerife, Lanzarote, Ibiza, the Canaries... the incidence of the virus is very low - less than the UK. ""The German government's reaction has been to quarantine people going to the north-east of Spain, but allow people to go to all of the other places I've just said, and that's a much more targeted and sophisticated approach."" Hays Travel said it had a two-year turnaround plan in place, and that although 2020 ""looked really bad"", bookings for 2021 were already up on the same period in 2019. Hays Travel took over Thomas Cook's 555 travel agents last October Hays Travel made the surprise announcement in October 2019 that it was taking charge of all of Thomas Cook's 555 travel agents across the UK, after the 178-year-old firm went out of business. This prevented thousands of staff from losing their jobs. But the coronavirus pandemic has put major pressure on many parts of the economy, including the travel sector. Rival travel firm Tui said last week that it would close nearly a third of its High Street stores in the UK and Ireland because of the coronavirus pandemic and in response to changes in customer behaviour. Meanwhile, on Monday sports retail chain DW Sports announcedit had fallen into administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk. It followed an announcement by HSBC on Monday that it would accelerate 35,000 job losses and news from Byron Burger on Friday that it would cut 650 jobs and close more than half of its restaurants. There have been an estimated 150,000 redundancies so far. Last week's cuts included 450 jobs going at Selfridges, 650 at busmaker Alexander Dennis, 900 at Dyson and 1,200 workers facing redundancy at the National Trust. Other lay-offs announced during the pandemic have included: Up to 5,000 job cuts at Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin 1,900 jobs at CafÃ© Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group 1,000 jobs at Pret A Manger 1,700 UK jobs at plane-maker Airbus 1,300 crew and 727 pilots at EasyJet 550 jobs at Daily Mirror publisher Reach.

"Juan Carlos is under investigation in Spain, as well as in Switzerland Spain's former King Juan Carlos has left the country for an unknown destination, weeks after he was linked to an inquiry into alleged corruption. Juan Carlos, 82, announced the move on Monday in a letter to his son, Felipe, to whom he handed power six years ago. He said he would be available if prosecutors needed to interview him. In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened an investigation into the alleged involvement of Juan Carlos in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia. The former king had most likely already left when the letter was released on Monday, Spain's El PaÃ­s newspaper reports. It is unclear where Juan Carlos is, though some Spanish media report he is in the Dominican Republic. It is a humiliating exit for a king who had once seemed set to go down in history as the leader who skilfully guided Spain from dictatorship to democracy after the death of General Franco in 1975, BBC Europe correspondent Nick Beake says. Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune Spain ex-king probed over Saudi rail deal King Felipe renounces father's inheritance Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014 after nearly 40 years as king following a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. In the letter, the former monarch wrote that he was making the decision ""in the face of the public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are generating"" and in the hope of allowing his son to carry out his functions as king with ""tranquillity"". ""Guided by the conviction to best serve the people of Spain, its institutions, and you as king, I inform you of my decision at this time to leave Spain. ""A decision I make with deep emotion but with great serenity,"" the letter said. King Felipe VI (right) has been trying to distance himself from his father Juan Carlos The statement from the Zarzuela palace said that King Felipe VI had conveyed ""his heartfelt respect and gratitude"" to his father for this decision. In March,King Felipe VI renounced the inheritance of his father.The royal palace also said at the time that Juan Carlos would stop receiving an annual grant of â¬194,000 ($228,000; Â£174,520). Spain's Supreme Court has said it aims to establish Juan Carlos's connection with the Saudi project after his abdication in June 2014. At that point he lost his immunity from prosecution. Spanish firms won a â¬6.7bn (Â£6bn) deal to build a Mecca-Medina rail link. This video can not be played King Juan Carlos, 76, has had health problems in recent years The probe involves Swiss banks too. Spanish anti-corruption officials suspect that the former king kept some undeclared funds in Switzerland, and a Swiss investigation is under way. The Spanish government has said that ""justice is equal for all"" and it would ""not interfere"" in the inquiry. Born in Rome, Italy, in 1938 Ascends the throne on 22 November 1975, two days after the death of fascist dictator Gen Francisco Franco Juan Carlos was widely admired for steering Spain to democracy during a difficult period But towards the end of his 39-year reign he drew growing criticism Abdicates on 18 June 2014 in favour of his son Felipe Spain's monarchy shaken by ex-king's Swiss fortune Spain ex-king probed over Saudi rail deal King Felipe renounces father's inheritance Spanish princess cleared in tax trial Why is King Juan Carlos abdicating?

"This video can not be played Hays Travel founders tell 5 Live why theyâre having to lay off hundreds of staff The firm which bought Thomas Cook shops has said up to 878 employees out of 4,500 may lose their jobs because of new coronavirus travel restrictions.

"Conservative MP Liam Fox is a former trade minister Documents on UK-US trade talks, leaked ahead of the 2019 general election, were stolen from an email account belonging to Conservative MP Liam Fox, it has emerged. The papers were published online and used byLabour in the 2019 campaignto claim the NHS would be put at risk. The UK government has said Russians almost certainlysought to interfere in the electionthrough the documents. A criminal inquiry into the leaking of the documents is under way. A spokesman for the National Crime Agency confirmed it was leading the investigation, but added he could not comment further. Mr Fox was international trade secretary from July 2016 to July 2019. It is not clear when his account was accessed and the information stolen. Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim Reuters, whichfirst reported,externalthe story, said hackers accessed Mr Fox's account multiple times between 12 July and 21 October last year. A government spokesperson said: ""There is an ongoing criminal investigation into how the documents were acquired, and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this point. ""But as you would expect, the government has very robust systems in place to protect the IT systems of officials and staff."" Last month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government had ""reasonable confidence"" that Russian actors had tried to interfere in the December 2019 general election. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election He told the BBC they had sought to ""spread online, illegally obtained, leaked government documents"" around the UK-US trade negotiations for after the country leaves the EU. Mr Raab said the government would ""reserve the right to take the appropriate action"" when the criminal investigation concluded. The UK government was later criticised in a report from the Intelligence and Security Committee -known as the ""Russia report""- for having ""badly underestimated"" the threat the country posed. The mystery of the ""trade leaks"" is slowly being revealed - though still not completely. The 2019 general election now looks like it was the target of what is known a ""hack and leak"" operation, similar - though not on the same scale - as the one Russian military intelligence launched in the 2016 US presidential election. Last month, the government said it believed Russian actors were responsible for spreading the trade document on social media. But there was still the question of how it was first obtained. Now, we know it came from a hack of an email account belonging to Liam Fox. The exact identity of the Russian group behind the attack remains murky. Whether it was the same group which then spread the document is unclear and that group (codenamed Secondary Infektion) is not thought to be the same as the one behind events in the US election, which had a larger impact. Hackers from many countries have targeted politicians in recent years. But coming soon after the Russia report, this will serve as a reminder that groups based in Russia are often the most adept at not just stealing, but also using, the information. Responding to reports of the hack on Mr Fox's email, a spokesperson for the National Cyber Security Centre said it works closely with MPs and political parties to offer them ""the best cyber security guidance and support."" ""We have worked closely with political parties for several years on how to protect and defend against cyber attacks - including publishing advice on our website.

"This video can not be played Politicians from across the political spectrum pay tribute to John Hume The Nobel Peace Prize winner and prominent Northern Ireland politician John Hume has died aged 83. He died in a Londonderry nursing home following a long period of illness. One of the highest-profile politicians in Northern Ireland for more than 30 years, he helped create the climate that brought an end to the Troubles. He was a founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in 1970 and led the party from 1979 until 2001. Obituary: John Hume John Hume: Life in pictures Tributes paid to 'political titan' John Hume Mr Hume played a major role in the peace talks, which led to theGood Friday Agreement,externalin 1998. David Trimble, U2 singer Bono and John Hume campaigning for the peace deal in 1998 He was widely admired for his steadfast commitment to peaceful, democratic politics during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Tributes have been paid by political leaders past and present, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was in office when the peace deal was signed. Mr Blair said he was ""a visionary who refused to believe the future had to be the same as the past"". ""His contribution to peace in Northern Ireland was epic and he will rightly be remembered for it,"" he said. ""He was insistent it was possible, tireless in pursuit of it and endlessly creative in seeking ways of making it happen."" This video can not be played John Hume became leader of the SDLP in 1979, a post which he relinquished in November 2001 Former US President Bill Clinton said Mr Hume ""fought his long war for peace in Northern Ireland"" ""His chosen weapons: an unshakeable commitment to nonviolence, persistence, kindness and love,"" he said. ""With his enduring sense of honour, he kept marching on against all odds towards a brighter future for all the children of Northern Ireland. ""I'll never forget our night in Derry in 1995, with the town square and blocks around full of hopeful faces, walking with him across the Peace Bridge nearly 20 years later, and all of the moments we shared in between."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Northern Ireland had ""lost a great man who did so much to help bring an end to the Troubles and build a better future for all"". He said Mr Hume's vision ""paved the way for the stability, positivity and dynamism of the Northern Ireland of today"". SDLP co-founder Austin Currie said ""John Hume is the greatest Irishman since Parnell"". ""His place in Irish history is richly deserved. Hume's consistency provided a compass through some terrible times,"" he said. In the late 1980s, Mr Hume took considerable risks for peace byholding talks with the then leader of Sinn FÃ©in, Gerry Adams.,external The talks were controversial because the IRA was still heavily involved in violence, but Mr Hume's aim was to persuade republicans to commit to exclusively democratic means. The Hume-Adams talks helped to lay the foundations for the1994 IRA ceasefire,externaland later negotiations which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement. John Hume faced enormous criticism for his decision to hold talks with Gerry Adams Mr Adams said he was ""a political leader genuinely prepared to look at the bigger picture and to put the wider interests of society above narrow party politics"". He said his decision to meet him was a ""breakthrough moment in Irish politics"". ""When others were stuck in the ritual politics of condemnation, John Hume had the courage to take real risks for peace,"" he added. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin hailed Mr Hume as ""a true peacemaker"". ""During the darkest days of paramilitary terrorism and sectarian strife, he kept hope alive. And with patience, resilience and unswerving commitment, he triumphed and delivered a victory for peace,"" he said. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster described the former SDLP leader as a ""giant in Irish nationalism"". ""In our darkest days he recognised that violence was the wrong path and worked steadfastly to promote democratic politics,"" the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader added. Following the 1998 peace deal, Mr Hume was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with the then leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble. John Hume and David Trimble were presented with doves of peace sculptures Lord Trimble said from the outset Mr Hume urged people to stick to their objective peacefully. ""He was a major contributor to politics in Northern Ireland, particularly to the process that gave us an agreement that we are still working our way through,"" he said. ""He will be remembered for that contribution for years to come."" Mr Hume spent decades fighting and winning elections to different parliaments at Stormont, Westminster and Brussels. He served as member of the European Parliament (MEP) for more than 25 years, and held a seat in Westminster as MP for the Foyle constituency for almost 22 years. This video can not be played Former BBC Ireland Correspondent Denis Murray: ""John Hume was a giant of world politics"" Former Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern, who co-signed the 1998 peace deal with Tony Blair, said Mr Hume always ""saw the bigger picture"" in Irish politics. He credited Mr Hume with the idea of ratifying the deal with different referenda on both sides of the Irish border. ""When the Good Friday Agreement was signed by Tony and I, he [Mr Hume] said: 'You put this to the people north and south and it will get the legitimacy of the people'. ""That was singularly his idea and it really was a bright idea,"" Mr Ahern told BBC Radio Five Live. John Hume with his wife Pat after his election to the European Parliament in 1979 Irish President Michael D Higgins said Mr Hume had ""remodelled politics in Ireland"" and hailed his ""personal bravery and leadership"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said Northern Ireland would not be where it was today ""without his leadership and courage"". ""He dedicated his life to peace, and for that the people of Northern Ireland will never forget him,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald described him as ""a national icon"". Archbishop Eamon Martin said ""a great sadness"" had descended over the city of Derry. The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland described Mr Hume as ""a paragon of peace, a giant of a statesman whose legacy of unstinting service to the common good is internationally acclaimed"". There is no way you could overestimate John Hume's contribution in the political development of Northern Ireland. He was definitely, during those years, the brains behind the approach to the peace process. He worked on differing relationships, trying to solve problems which seemed for so many years to be completely without any possible solution. He helped create the political space in which the different parties could manoeuvre their way towards what became the the Good Friday Agreement. John Hume battled on at very hard times during the Troubles - when any kind of dialogue came under attack from opponents as being a sign of weakness. He persevered with his efforts to bring about a solution. Mr Hume died in the early hours of Monday at Owen Mor nursing home in Derry, having suffered dementia for several years. Books of condolence have been opened for Mr Humein Derry,externalandin Belfast,external. His funeral Mass will be celebrated at the Cathedral of Saint Eugene, Derry, at 11.30 BST on Wednesday. In a statement, his family said his loss would be greatly felt and they had drawn ""great comfort"" from ""being with John again in the last days of his life"".

"The MS Roald Amundsen is owned by the Norwegian firm Hurtigruten At least 41 passengers and crew on a Norwegian cruise ship have tested positive for Covid-19, officials say. Hundreds more passengers who travelled on the MS Roald Amundsen are in quarantine and awaiting test results, the company that owns the ship said. The ship, which belongs to the Norwegian firm Hurtigruten, docked in the port of Tromso in northern Norway on Friday. Hurtigruten has halted all leisure cruises because of the outbreak. ""This is a serious situation for everyone involved. We have not been good enough and we have made mistakes,"" Chief Executive Daniel Skjeldam said in a statement on Monday. ""A preliminary evaluation shows a breakdown in several of our internal procedures,"" he added. ""The only responsible choice is to suspend all expedition sailings."" Will we ever take cruise holidays again? The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes home Where can I take a foreign holiday this summer? Norway's government has announced it will stop all cruise ships with more than 100 people on board from disembarking passengers for at least 14 days. And police said they were investigating whether any laws had been broken prior to the outbreak on the Roald Amundsen. ""We have found grounds to open a case,"" a police official told Reuters news agency. The MS Roald Amundsen had been on a week-long voyage to Svalbard in the Arctic, and was also reportedly scheduled to visit ports in England and Scotland in September. Four crew members were admitted to hospital on Friday with coronavirus symptoms, shortly after the ship docked in the Arctic port of Tromso, and they later tested positive for the virus. Another 32 crew members on board were found to be infected. The staff who tested positive included German, French and Filipino citizens. They were tested for the virus before leaving their home countries but did not quarantine before starting work on the ship, Hurtigruten said. Almost 180 passengers were allowed to depart the ship on Friday, leaving the authorities scrambling over the weekend to locate and test those who had been on board. All the passengers have now been contacted and told to self-isolate for 10 days, health officials said. Five passengers have so far tested positive out of 387 who had travelled on the ship since 17 July. ""We expect that more infections will be found in connection to this outbreak,"" said Line Vold, a health official. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? SYMPTOMS:How long should I self-isolate? HOTSPOTS:Tracking the global outbreak The majority of passengers are reported to be Norwegians, but there were also travellers from Germany, Denmark, the UK and the US on board. The outbreak on the MS Roald Amundsen is the latest blow to an industry that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with shares in the major global operators falling dramatically since the start of March. Thousands of passengers were left stranded at sea earlier this year as ships were hit by outbreaks of the virus and countries closed their borders. The MS Roald Amundsen was itself stranded for several days in March after Chile refused it entry as it tightened its border restrictions. Similar incidents involving other ships occurred over the following weeks in various places around the world. And while the industry has restarted in recent times, there have been other coronavirus-related setbacks. A crew member on a ship in the Pacific tested positive for the virus on Sunday. The Paul Gauguin was forced to suspend its journey when the case was detected by the ship's doctor, local media report. Passengers were told to stay in their cabins as the ship turned back to Papeete on the island of Tahiti, where all on board are being tested. Ahead of resuming its operations, Ponant, the company that runs the Paul Gauguin, hadreassured customers in a blog post,externalthat it had strict regulations in place that ""go further than the international standards for the sector"". In any case cruise companies are expecting strong bookings for 2021. They are reporting a combination of new bookings and people using vouchers they received for cancelled cruises that had been scheduled for this year. ""We absolutely believe when we come out of this we will lean into our repeat cruisers,"" Christine Duffy, the president of Carnival Cruise line, told Reuters. ""They really are the ambassadors for the cruise industry.""

"Thousands of DNA test machines will be rolled out in hospitals from September New 90-minute tests that can detect coronavirus and flu will be rolled out in hospitals and care homes from next week. The ""on-the-spot"" swab and DNA tests will help distinguish between Covid-19 and other seasonal illnesses, the government said. The health secretary said this would be ""hugely beneficial"" over the winter. Currently, a third of tests take longer than 24 hours to process. The announcement comes as the government pushed back a July target to regularly test all care home staff and residents - a key move to identify so-called silent spreaders, those who are infected but do not show symptoms. This is unlikely to be achieved until September because the number of testing kits has become more limited. How bad will winter really be? How can I get a coronavirus test? What symptoms should I look out for? The government said almost half a million of the new rapid swab tests, called LamPORE, will be available from next week in adult care settings and laboratories, with millions more due to be rolled out later in the year. Additionally, thousands of DNA test machines, which have already been used in eight London hospitals and can analyse nose swabs, will be available across NHS hospitals from September. Around 5,000 machines, supplied by DnaNudge, will provide 5.8 million tests in the coming months, the Department for Health said. There is currently no publicly available data on the accuracy of the new tests. But Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who has been advising the government on tests, said they produced the same ""sensitivity"" as the current lab-based tests. The breakthrough on testing is important for a number of reasons - not just because one has the ability to test for flu and other viruses too. Firstly, speed. The fact the tests do not have to be sent off to a lab means the processing times are much quicker. In hospital, most tests - 9 in 10 - are currently turned around in 24 hours. But those done in the community via regional drive-through centres, using postal kits and mobile units, tend to take longer because they have to be sent away to labs for processing. Results are only returned in 24 hours in half of cases. The two tests will also help to increase capacity. Currently around 300,000 tests a day can be processed, but the aim is to get to 500,000. But this is all dependent on delivery. The DNA test will not be rolled out until September, while the LamPORE test is ready to go now but is still waiting for approval from regulators - which the government is expecting by the end of the week. The government has also not published full details on the accuracy of the tests. The testing system is complex and is reliant on many different factors, including multiple supply chains and having the workforce to carry them out. If just one thing goes wrong - as the roll-out of the whole care home testing system shows - delivery can fall short of ambition. This video can not be played ""A device this small is effectively a laboratory"" - Prof Chris Toumazou, of DnaNudge, explains how the new test works Health Secretary Matt Hancock described these latest innovations as a ""big step forward"" and said the government was on target to reach 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. He said the new technologies could be used in settings such as schools and across the community where ""we want to test people who don't have symptoms so we can find out where the virus is"". Mr Hancock added: ""The fact these tests can detect flu as well as Covid-19 will be hugely beneficial as we head into winter, so patients can follow the right advice to protect themselves and others."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would receive a share of the new tests - but its own clinical advisers would look carefully at their accuracy and efficacy before they are made available. This video can not be played Matt Hancock says test results being delivered more quickly would keep ""rates of infection downâ. Dame Anne Johnson, professor of infectious disease and epidemiology at University College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the new tests were ""great news"" but part of a wider system which needed to act rapidly overall. Rapid diagnosis was useful, but the most important thing was for people to self isolate if they felt ill, she said. Sir Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute and a member of Scientists for Labour, said the government needed to ""treat the public as adults"" in Covid-19 communications. ""We need openness, transparency, scrutiny, and a leadership of people taking responsibility for the decision-making,"" he said. The testing news comes as: Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidshe won't hesitate to reintroduce lockdown restrictionsif Covid-19 starts to get ""out of control"" Owners ofrestaurants, pubs and hairdressers in Leicester- the first UK city to have a localised lockdown - have spoken of their ""relief"" at being able to open for the first time since March A government scheme to encourage people to visit restaurants, cafes and pubs,across the UK has now launched- giving customers of 72,000 establishments 50% off meals bought from Monday to Wednesday in August Groups ofup to 30 people can now meet in Walesand pubs, cafes and restaurants can serve people inside as the lockdown rules were further eased on Monday Theremight never be a silver bullet treatment for coronavirus, according to the director general of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Coronavirus tests are currently carried out at drive-through or walk-in sites as well as at hospitals for patients and some NHS workers. Home testing kits can also be delivered to someone's door so that people can test themselves. Swab samples are analysed at a laboratory before the result is passed on to the individual. Unlike other seasonal illnesses, those infected with Covid-19 are required to self-isolate for 10 days. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Regular testing of care home residents and staffwas meant to have started on 6 Julybut officials said this might not be in place until the end of the first week of September. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: ""A combination of factors have meant that a more limited number of testing kits, predominantly used in care homes, are currently available for asymptomatic re-testing and we are working round the clock with providers to restore capacity."" Last month, the government withdrew one brand of home-testing kits used in care homes over safety concerns. A further nine coronavirus deaths were reported on Monday, taking the total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK to 46,210. The latest government figures also showed there were 938 new confirmed cases. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? CARE HOMES:The forgotten frontline? FORT SALEM:Fancy some escapism?

"This video can not be played Hays Travel founders tell 5 Live why theyâre having to lay off hundreds of staff The firm which bought Thomas Cook shops has said up to 878 employees out of 4,500 may lose their jobs because of new coronavirus travel restrictions. Hays Travel took on more than 2,000 former Thomas Cook employees when it went bust in October last year. Owners John and Irene Hays said Spanish travel restrictions meant hundreds of thousands of holidays were cancelled. They were ""devastated"" staff would lose jobs ""through no fault of their own"", the couple said. In a joint statement, the Hays said they had ""made every possible effort"" to protect the jobs of all the firm's staff, ""including those who were employed when Hays Travel took on the Thomas Cook shops last October"". The Sunderland-based company said it was now consulting with 344 staff training as travel consultants and the 534 who work in the foreign exchange division. The firm said its experienced travel sales staff, apprentices and other head office staff were not affected by the cuts. ""We are devastated that after all of our efforts and the huge investment we've made, we now face losing some of our valued employees, through no fault of their own. ""Following the decision to ban travel to Spain and the changes in furlough conditions coming at the same time, we have had no choice,"" the firm added. In July, the governmentbrought back a 14-day quarantine for travellersreturning to the UK from Spain after a spike in coronavirus cases. The Foreign Office laterupdated its advice against all non-essential travel to Spainto include the Balearic and Canary Islands as well as the mainland. And firms who have furloughed staff during the pandemichad to start contributing to the government job retention scheme from Saturday, putting more pressure on struggling companies. Mrs Hays told the BBC it was ""impossible to overstate the importance of Spain"" on the company's business. Mr Hays said the firm disagreed with the government's approach to quarantining Spain: ""Other parts of Spain, on the Costa Del Sol, the islands, Majorca, Tenerife, Lanzarote, Ibiza, the Canaries... the incidence of the virus is very low - less than the UK. ""The German government's reaction has been to quarantine people going to the north-east of Spain, but allow people to go to all of the other places I've just said, and that's a much more targeted and sophisticated approach."" Hays Travel said it had a two-year turnaround plan in place, and that although 2020 ""looked really bad"", bookings for 2021 were already up on the same period in 2019. Hays Travel took over Thomas Cook's 555 travel agents last October Hays Travel made the surprise announcement in October 2019 that it was taking charge of all of Thomas Cook's 555 travel agents across the UK, after the 178-year-old firm went out of business. This prevented thousands of staff from losing their jobs. But the coronavirus pandemic has put major pressure on many parts of the economy, including the travel sector. Rival travel firm Tui said last week that it would close nearly a third of its High Street stores in the UK and Ireland because of the coronavirus pandemic and in response to changes in customer behaviour. Meanwhile, on Monday sports retail chain DW Sports announcedit had fallen into administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk. It followed an announcement by HSBC on Monday that it would accelerate 35,000 job losses and news from Byron Burger on Friday that it would cut 650 jobs and close more than half of its restaurants.

"Decades of conservation efforts have led to a rebound in the number of giant pandas Saving the giant panda is one of the big success stories of conservation. Decades of efforts to create protected habitat for the iconic mammal has pulled it back from the brink of extinction. But, according to a new study, while many other animals in the same landscape have benefited from this conservation work, some have lost out. Leopards, snow leopards, wolves and Asian wild dogs have almost disappeared from the majority of protected areas. Driven to near extinction by logging, poaching and disease, their loss could lead to ""major shifts, even collapse, in ecosystems"", said researchers in China. Without the likes of leopards and wolves, deer and livestock can roam unchecked, causing damage to natural habitats, with knock-on effects for other wildlife, including pandas themselves. By protecting the panda's forests, conservationists believed they would be protecting not only the charismatic black-and-white animal, but the many other species roaming the same habitat. But while that has worked for some other wildlife, the efforts do not appear to have worked for large carnivores, such as the leopard and wolf. A team of researchers now says a broader - holistic - approach is needed to manage the ecosystem in which the panda lives - one that ensures key species don't lose out. China is home to the world's largest snow leopard population This was ""critically needed to better increase the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystems not only for giant pandas but also for other wild species"", said co-author Dr Sheng Li of Peking University in Beijing. In order to achieve this, the researchers outline a range of measures including enforcement against poaching and restoring habitats for the animals that large carnivores eat. Giant pandas rebound off endangered list Meet the new poster animals of conservation Giant pandas are seen as living proof that conservation works. Their numbers in the wild are finally rebounding after years of decline, and in 2016 they were upgraded from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable"" on the official extinction Red List. The distinctive black and white mammal is regarded as an ""umbrella species"". These are species selected as subjects for conservation, typically because protecting them indirectly helps other wildlife in that ecological community. In the wild panda's case, protecting the forests in which it lives has been good for many other animals and plants, including birds and small carnivores. Yet, large predators such as leopards, wolves and the little-known Asian wild dog, or dhole, which tend to range far and wide, seem to have fared badly. Since panda reserves were set up in the 1960s, all four species have been lost from a big proportion of reserves. Leopards have disappeared from 81% of reserves, snow leopards from 38%, wolves from 77% and Asian wild dogs from 95%. Asian wild dog: The highly social animal suffers from habitat loss and threats from diseases Numbers are now very low. For instance, there were only four sightings of the Asian wild dog among data from almost 8,000 survey stations recording more than 1.5 million camera days' of footage. Prof Samuel Turvey of ZSL (Zoological Society of London), who is not connected with the study, said conservation in China and elsewhere in the world has often been based around landscape protection for specific ""flagship species"", with inferred wider benefits for regional biodiversity. This includes giant pandas in central China, and critically endangered gibbons in Hainan, he said. ""This has led to some important species recoveries, but efforts to maintain threatened biodiversity must also address human activities at the wider ecosystem-level, otherwise non-target species might continue to slip away unnoticed,"" said Prof Turvey. In the study, the researchers analysed data from 73 protected areas, including 66 giant panda nature reserves, comparing historical survey data with a decade's worth of extensive camera-trap surveys. The research is published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"New tests for Covid-19 and flu that can give results in 90 minutes are to be rolled out in the UK next week While hopes for a vaccine are strong, there may never be a ""silver bullet"" for the coronavirus, the WHO warns The pandemic is likely to be ""lengthy"", the UN health agency says, and response fatigue is a risk Infections in the Australian state of Victoria are surging - many businesses to close under new lockdown UK firm Hays Travel has said up to 878 employees out of 4,500 may lose their jobs because of the pandemic Diners at UK restaurants to get 50% off meals as ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme launches Manchester, in northern England, declares a major incident after a rise in the infection rate Globally, more than 18 million infections and 689,000 deaths have been recorded - Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce We're ending our live coverage here for now. But we'll be back tomorrow with more updates on coronavirus around the world. In the meantime here are the latest headlines:  Italy has reported about 248,000 confirmed coronavirus cases The results of nationwide antibody tests in Italy suggest that 1.48 million people, or 2.5% of the population, have had coronavirus. The estimate is six times greater than the number of confirmed cases in the official virus tally. The tests were conducted on almost 65,000 Italians as part of a campaign to see how widely the virus had spread. The ""provisional analysis"" of the results was announced by health officials. They stressed that the tests were not intended to determine whether Italians with antibodies were now safe from coronavirus.   Marian Thomas and Michelle Teale A woman with incurable cancer has been reunited with her mother after the extended lockdown in Leicester kept them separated for 22 weeks. Michelle Teale, 58, from Leicester, was shielding because she has secondary breast cancer. She had not seen her mother Marian Thomas, 85, who lives in Cleethorpes, since 2 March whenthe UK was in the early stagesof the coronavirus crisis. ""I'm feeling just elated. It's like a weight's been lifted,"" said Mrs Teale. The head of the United Nations has said indiginous communities must be consulted in the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement,,externalUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the outbreak has had a ""devastating impact"" on more than 476 million indigenous people around the world. ""It is critical for countries to marshal the resources to respond to their needs, honour their contributions and respect their inalienable rights,"" he said. He added that respecting the rights of indigenous communities means ensuring that they have an input in Covid-19 response and recovery strategies. Indigenous people tend to be at higher risk from emerging infectious diseases compared to other populations. Issues include inadequate access to health care, clean water and sanitation, Mr Guterres said. Read more:How Covid-19 could destroy indigenous communities Radio 4 PM Russia is pushing ahead with a coronavirus vaccine, working with manufacturers in Brazil and India to produce it in what it says is ""very large amounts"". Kirill Dmitriyev, head of Russia's Direct Investment Fund, said it was expected to be registered in the next 10 days. He said reports in the West that it may be unsafe were an example of ""dishonest competition"". Mass vaccine production in September is Russia's goal. They have more than one such vaccine in the pipeline. But Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, a virologist and lecturer in global health at St George's, University of London, told BBC Radio 4's PM no data had yet been shared about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. ""It's quite worrying that the claims have been made without showing data,"" she said. The scientific community felt there has been an element of rushing - and the possibly of shortcuts having been taken - when it comes to a Russian vaccine, she added.   Just hours after classes resumed at an Indiana school, administrators were notified that a student had tested positive for Covid-19. The school district - one of the first in the US to reopen - told families that it has now enacted its Covid-19 protocol: the student, who attended classes for part of the day, has been isolated and all close contacts have been identified. And two states south, in Georgia, the state's largest school district has confirmed that roughly 260 employees have either tested positive for the virus, or have been exposed to infections. The Gwinnett County School District (GCPS) is set to reopen for online classes on 12 August. But despite the confirmed community spread, parents held protests last week demanding students be allowed to return to school. The reports come as US schools grapple with how to safely reopen as the school year approaches. Despite climbing infections across the country, President Donald Trump has urged schools to reopen by fall. BBC World Service Deborah Birx is a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force US President Donald Trump has lashed out at one of his top medical advisers who warned on Sunday that the US was entering a new phase in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Deborah Birx told CNN the disease was ""extraordinarily widespread"" across the country and a greater threat than when the outbreak first began. But on Twitter, Mr Trump described her interview as ""pathetic"". He said Dr Birx had fallen into a trap set by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has accused Mr Trump of spreading disinformation about the virus and Dr Birx of doing little to counter it. The president's outburst comes two days after he described as ""wrong"" an interview given by his other coronavirus expert, Dr Anthony Fauci. Dr Fauci had said the high rate of infection in the US stemmed from an inadequate response by the authorities.  Read more:Nancy Pelosi criticises Deborah Birx Florida surpassed its record for most Covid-19 deaths in a single week on Sunday, with 1,230 fatalities reported in the past seven days. The Sunshine State broke the previous record - set one week earlier - after reporting 257 deaths on Friday, its highest single-day tally so far. Florida is among the states leading the US in terms of total Covid-19 infections, second only to California, which has double the population. Its soaring coronavirus hospitalisations and infections are happening alongside Tropical Storm Isaias, moving along the state's east coast. Thousands of power cuts have already been reported and Governor Ron De Santis has told residents to stockpile a week's supply of food, water and medicine. Trade in a town hit by a coronavirus outbreak is said to have taken a downturn over the weekend. Some pubs had closed voluntarily following the outbreak in Stone, Staffordshire. Nineteen people there tested positive after cases were linked to the Crown and Anchor pub. Ed Stant, secretary of traders' group Stone is Where the Heart is, said trade had been starting to pick up since lockdown but that ""for the vast majority it's fallen like a stone"". He described Saturday night in the town as being ""like a ghost town"". One restaurant said 17 of the 34 people who booked for a meal on Saturday evening did not show up.

Johnson thanked Netflix for helping to provide ""the safest and most aggressive 'quarantined bubble'"" for the film, which also features Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. âLike so many of us here in the U.S. and around the world - getting back can be a tough decision that  requires real consideration and strategic planning around best health practices and safety measures,""Johnson wrote on Instagram.,external ""I'm confident in our safety strategy and execution, but we'll also be fluid and amenable to best practice changes on the fly."" Coronavirus has brought production on other fan-favourite programmes and movies to a halt. Days of Our Lives - the longest-running US soap opera - is slated to return to production in September, after a months-long hiatus. Most music events have been cancelled around the world but four festivals were still going to take place in Malta this month. No longer. They have now been called off due to a rise in Covid-19 cases on the island. Escape 2 The Island, Rhythm + Waves, BPM Festival: Malta and Mi Casa Festival have all been called off. A statement from each festival says they are all ""disappointed"" not to be going ahead, after making a decision with the Maltese Tourism Authority. Ticket holders, many who were from the UK, will receive a full refund. Malta washoping to be 2020's festival hotspot, with most clubs in Mallorca and Ibiza closed and festivals in the UK cancelled.

""Chef Eric"", who did not want to give his full name, runs Les Enfants Terribles in Weymouth, Dorset. He said he had been let down by more than 100 people since he reopened the restaurant on 4 July. ""I have been put in a very difficult position after what has already been a difficult time due to coronavirus,"" said Chef Eric, whose previous ""good"" customers have included former England footballer David Beckham. ""One woman said I should double-book tables. Can you imagine if a customer turned up and I said, 'I'm sorry you can't sit here because I also booked it for someone else'. Madness."" On Saturday, he said 12 people had also left without paying the bill, which Dorset Police is investigating.

The MS Roald Amundsen is owned by the Norwegian firm Hurtigruten Earlier we told you about the outbreak on the MS Roald
Amundsen, a Norwegian cruise ship where at least 41 passengers and crew have tested positive for Covid-19. This is the latest blow to an industry that has been hit hard by the pandemic, with shares in the major global operators falling
dramatically since the start of March. While the industry has
restarted in recent times, there have already been setbacks. A crew member on a ship in the
Pacific tested positive for the virus on Sunday. The Paul Gauguin was forced to
suspend its journey when the case was detected by the ship's doctor, local
media report. Passengers were then told to
stay in their cabins as the ship turned back to Papeete on the island of
Tahiti, where all on board are being tested. Ahead of resuming its
operations, Ponant, the company that runs the Paul Gauguin, had reassured customers in a blog
post that it had strict regulations in place that ""go further
than the international standards for the sector"". But cruise companies are expecting
strong bookings for 2021. They are reporting a combination of new bookings and
people using vouchers they received for cancelled cruises this year. ""We absolutely believe when
we come out of this we will lean into our repeat cruisers,"" Christine
Duffy, the president of Carnival Cruise line, told Reuters news agency. ""They really
are the ambassadors for the cruise industry."" Find out more about what is happening with the MS Roald Amundsen The captain and owners of The Liberty Belle riverboat were arrested by New York City deputy sheriffs on Saturday for holding a crowded cruise around the city, in defiance of coronavirus social distancing rules. The boat, which boasts four bars, three outdoor decks and space for 600 guests, was used to host a party on the weekend with more than 170 guests on board. Owners Ronny Vargas and Alex Suazo were arrested for violating local social distancing provisions and operating an unlicensed bar and bottle club, the sheriff's office said.

Here's the latest information on coronavirus in the UK, after nine more deaths were reported on Monday. That takes the total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK to 46,210. The latest government figures also showed there were 938 new confirmed cases. Drayton Manor opened in 1950 The family-run Drayton Manor theme park in Englandhas gone into administration after being hit by Storm Denis and coronavirus. The park in Staffordshire has been run by the Bryan family since opening in 1950. It is being taken over by the Looping Group, which runs a number of attractions in Europe. The jobs of some 600 employees have been protected, administrators said. Elsewhere in England, it was announced thatManchester's famous Belle Vue greyhound racing stadium will not reopen. Operators said the coronavirus lockdown had a ""particularly negative effect"". The stadium was built in 1926 and has also been used for speedway and stock car racing. All employees will be made redundant. The oldest department store in the US, Lord & Taylor, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, joining a growing list of iconic retailers to file for protection amid coronavirus shutdowns. The collapse of the 194-year-old firm comes just weeks after two other department store chains - Neiman Marcus and JC Penney - did the same. Lord & Taylor has about 40 stores across the US, many of which are in shopping malls. The company's origins trace back to 1826 New York City when English immigrants Samuel Lord and George Washington Taylor opened a dry goods store in Manhattan. It was bought by clothing rental company Le Tote last year for about $100m (Â£57m). At its peak, the chain was a bastion of high-end fashion. Christopher Biggins was among the cast in Aladdin at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley in 2019 The UK's biggest pantomime producer has said it has been ""left with no choice"" but to launch a consultation on whether its shows can go ahead this season. Qdos had set a deadline of 3 August to decide whether its 34 shows - in cities from Bristol to Birmingham and Bradford - can take place amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, the company said it had been ""very clear"" that it required clarity from the government regarding the reopening of theatres by today, ""in order for our pantomime season as we know it to take place"". The firm added: ""Based on the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sportâs reiteration last week that the government wonât be providing further guidance on theatres operating without social distancing until November at the earliest, we are left with no choice but to begin the consultation process with our partner theatres about the viability of each show. This is a complex process and will take several weeks to complete. ""We are not immediately announcing the postponement of all shows, however plans will be announced by individual theatres and communicated to ticket holders in due course.""

"Thousands of DNA test machines will be rolled out in hospitals from September New 90-minute tests that can detect coronavirus and flu will be rolled out in hospitals and care homes from next week. The ""on-the-spot"" swab and DNA tests will help distinguish between Covid-19 and other seasonal illnesses, the government said. The health secretary said this would be ""hugely beneficial"" over the winter. Currently, a third of tests take longer than 24 hours to process. The announcement comes as the government pushed back a July target to regularly test all care home staff and residents - a key move to identify so-called silent spreaders, those who are infected but do not show symptoms. This is unlikely to be achieved until September because the number of testing kits has become more limited. How bad will winter really be? How can I get a coronavirus test? What symptoms should I look out for? The government said almost half a million of the new rapid swab tests, called LamPORE, will be available from next week in adult care settings and laboratories, with millions more due to be rolled out later in the year. Additionally, thousands of DNA test machines, which have already been used in eight London hospitals and can analyse nose swabs, will be available across NHS hospitals from September. Around 5,000 machines, supplied by DnaNudge, will provide 5.8 million tests in the coming months, the Department for Health said. There is currently no publicly available data on the accuracy of the new tests. But Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who has been advising the government on tests, said they produced the same ""sensitivity"" as the current lab-based tests. The breakthrough on testing is important for a number of reasons - not just because one has the ability to test for flu and other viruses too. Firstly, speed. The fact the tests do not have to be sent off to a lab means the processing times are much quicker. In hospital, most tests - 9 in 10 - are currently turned around in 24 hours. But those done in the community via regional drive-through centres, using postal kits and mobile units, tend to take longer because they have to be sent away to labs for processing. Results are only returned in 24 hours in half of cases. The two tests will also help to increase capacity. Currently around 300,000 tests a day can be processed, but the aim is to get to 500,000. But this is all dependent on delivery. The DNA test will not be rolled out until September, while the LamPORE test is ready to go now but is still waiting for approval from regulators - which the government is expecting by the end of the week. The government has also not published full details on the accuracy of the tests. The testing system is complex and is reliant on many different factors, including multiple supply chains and having the workforce to carry them out. If just one thing goes wrong - as the roll-out of the whole care home testing system shows - delivery can fall short of ambition. This video can not be played ""A device this small is effectively a laboratory"" - Prof Chris Toumazou, of DnaNudge, explains how the new test works Health Secretary Matt Hancock described these latest innovations as a ""big step forward"" and said the government was on target to reach 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. He said the new technologies could be used in settings such as schools and across the community where ""we want to test people who don't have symptoms so we can find out where the virus is"". Mr Hancock added: ""The fact these tests can detect flu as well as Covid-19 will be hugely beneficial as we head into winter, so patients can follow the right advice to protect themselves and others."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would receive a share of the new tests - but its own clinical advisers would look carefully at their accuracy and efficacy before they are made available. This video can not be played Matt Hancock says test results being delivered more quickly would keep ""rates of infection downâ. Dame Anne Johnson, professor of infectious disease and epidemiology at University College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the new tests were ""great news"" but part of a wider system which needed to act rapidly overall. Rapid diagnosis was useful, but the most important thing was for people to self isolate if they felt ill, she said. Sir Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute and a member of Scientists for Labour, said the government needed to ""treat the public as adults"" in Covid-19 communications. ""We need openness, transparency, scrutiny, and a leadership of people taking responsibility for the decision-making,"" he said. The testing news comes as: Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidshe won't hesitate to reintroduce lockdown restrictionsif Covid-19 starts to get ""out of control"" Owners ofrestaurants, pubs and hairdressers in Leicester- the first UK city to have a localised lockdown - have spoken of their ""relief"" at being able to open for the first time since March A government scheme to encourage people to visit restaurants, cafes and pubs,across the UK has now launched- giving customers of 72,000 establishments 50% off meals bought from Monday to Wednesday in August Groups ofup to 30 people can now meet in Walesand pubs, cafes and restaurants can serve people inside as the lockdown rules were further eased on Monday Theremight never be a silver bullet treatment for coronavirus, according to the director general of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Coronavirus tests are currently carried out at drive-through or walk-in sites as well as at hospitals for patients and some NHS workers. Home testing kits can also be delivered to someone's door so that people can test themselves. Swab samples are analysed at a laboratory before the result is passed on to the individual. Unlike other seasonal illnesses, those infected with Covid-19 are required to self-isolate for 10 days. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Regular testing of care home residents and staffwas meant to have started on 6 Julybut officials said this might not be in place until the end of the first week of September. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: ""A combination of factors have meant that a more limited number of testing kits, predominantly used in care homes, are currently available for asymptomatic re-testing and we are working round the clock with providers to restore capacity."" Last month, the government withdrew one brand of home-testing kits used in care homes over safety concerns. A further nine coronavirus deaths were reported on Monday, taking the total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK to 46,210.

"This video can not be played Hays Travel founders tell 5 Live why theyâre having to lay off hundreds of staff The firm which bought Thomas Cook shops has said up to 878 employees out of 4,500 may lose their jobs because of new coronavirus travel restrictions. Hays Travel took on more than 2,000 former Thomas Cook employees when it went bust in October last year. Owners John and Irene Hays said Spanish travel restrictions meant hundreds of thousands of holidays were cancelled. They were ""devastated"" staff would lose jobs ""through no fault of their own"", the couple said. In a joint statement, the Hays said they had ""made every possible effort"" to protect the jobs of all the firm's staff, ""including those who were employed when Hays Travel took on the Thomas Cook shops last October"".

"Iran has been the worst-affected country in the Middle East The number of deaths from coronavirus in Iran is nearly triple what Iran's government claims, a BBC Persian service investigation has found. The government's own records appear to show almost 42,000 people died with Covid-19 symptoms up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry. The number of people known to be infected is also almost double official figures: 451,024 as opposed to 278,827. The official numbers still make Iran the worst-hit in the Middle East. In recent weeks, it has suffered a second steep rise in the number of cases. The first death in Iran from Covid-19 was recorded on 22 January, according to lists and medical records that have been passed to the BBC. This was almost a month before the first official case of coronavirus was reported there. Since the outbreak of the virus in Iran, many observers have doubted the official numbers. There have been irregularities in data between national and regional levels, which some local authorities have spoken out about,and statisticians have tried to give alternative estimates.,external. A level of undercounting, largely due to testing capacity, is seen across the world, but the information leaked to the BBC reveals Iranian authorities have reported significantly lower daily numbers despite having a record of all deaths - suggesting they were deliberately suppressed. The data was sent to the BBC by an anonymous source. It includes details of daily admissions to hospitals across Iran, including names, age, gender, symptoms, date and length of periods spent in hospital, and underlying conditions patients might have. The details on lists correspond to those of some living and deceased patients already known to the BBC. This video can not be played Iran's deputy health minister gets coronavirus The source says they have shared this data with the BBC to ""shed light on truth"" and to end ""political games"" over the epidemic. The discrepancy between the official figures and the number of deaths on these records also matches the difference between the official figure and calculations of excess mortality until mid-June. Excess mortality refers to the number of deaths above and beyond what would be expected under ""normal"" conditions. Tehran, the capital, has the highest number of deaths with 8,120 people who died with Covid-19 or symptoms similar to it. The city of Qom, the initial epicentre of the virus in Iran, is worst hit proportionally, with 1,419 deaths - that is one death with Covid-19 for every 1,000 people. It is notable that, across the country, 1,916 deaths were non-Iranian nationals. This indicates a disproportionate number of deaths amongst migrants and refugees, who are mostly from neighbouring Afghanistan. The overall trend of cases and deaths in the leaked data is similar to official reports, albeit different in size. The initial rise of deaths is far steeper than Health Ministry figures and by mid-March it was five times the official figure. Lockdown measures were imposed over the Nowruz (Iranian New Year) holidays at the end of the third week in March, and there was a corresponding decline in cases and deaths. Iran has introduced measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus But as government restrictions were relaxed, the cases and deaths started to rise again after late-May. Crucially the first recorded death on the leaked list occurred on 22 January, a month before the first case of coronavirus was officially reported in Iran. At the time Health Ministry officials were adamant in acknowledging not a single case of coronavirus in the country, despite reports by journalists inside Iran, and warnings from various medical professionals. In 28 days until the first official acknowledgement on 19 February, 52 people had already died. Doctors with direct knowledge of the matter have told the BBC that the Iranian health ministry has been under pressure from security and intelligence bodies inside Iran. Dr Pouladi (not their real name) told the BBC that the ministry ""was in denial"". ""Initially they did not have testing kits and when they got them, they weren't used widely enough. The position of the security services was not to admit to the existence of coronavirus in Iran,"" Dr Pouladi said. It was the persistence of two brothers, both doctors from Qom, which forced the health ministry to acknowledge the first official case. When Dr Mohammad Molayi and Dr Ali Molayi lost their brother, they insisted he should still be tested for Covid-19, which turned out to be positive. In Kamkar hospital, where their brother died, numerous patients were admitted with similar symptoms to Covid-19, and they would not respond to the usual treatments. Nevertheless, none of them were tested for the disease. Dr Pouladi says: ""They got unlucky. Someone with both decency and influence lost his brother. Dr Molayi had access to these gentlemen [health ministry officials] and did not give up."" Dr Molayi released a video of his late brother with a statement. The health ministry then finally acknowledged the first recorded case. Nevertheless state TV ran a report criticising him and falsely claiming the video of his brother was months old. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Iran mortuary worker cleanses bodies The start of outbreak coincided both with the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and with parliamentary elections. These were major opportunities for the Islamic Republic to demonstrate its popular support and not risk damaging it because of the virus. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, accused some of wanting to use the coronavirus to undermine the election. In the event, the election had a very low turnout. Iran's cover-up after it shot down a Ukrainian airliner fuelled anti-government protests Before the global coronavirus pandemic hit, Iran was already experiencing a series of its own crises. In November 2019, the government increased the price of petrol overnight and cracked down violently on protests which followed. Hundreds of protesters were killed in a few days. In January this year, the Iranian response to the US assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, seen as one of the most powerful figures in Iran after its Supreme Leader, created another problem. Then Iranian armed forces - on high alert - mistakenly fired missiles at a Ukrainian airliner only minutes after it had taken off from Tehran's international airport. All 176 people on board were killed. The Iranian authorities initially tried to cover up what happened, but after three days they were forced to admit it, resulting in considerable loss of face. This video can not be played Flight tracking data and open source footage shows how Mahan Air continued to fly Dr Nouroldin Pirmoazzen, a former MP who also was an official at the health ministry, told the BBC that in this context, the Iranian government was ""anxious and fearful of the truth"" when coronavirus hit Iran. He said: ""The government was afraid that the poor and the unemployed would take to the streets."" Dr Pirmoazzen points to the fact thatIran stopped international health organisation MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res from treating coronavirus cases in the central province of Isfahan,externalas evidence of how security-conscious its approach towards the pandemic is. Iran was going through tough times even before the military showdown with the US and coronavirus hit. The sanctions which followed Donald Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal in May 2018 hit the economy hard. Dr Pouladi says: ""Those who brought the country to this point don't pay the price. It is the poor people of the country and my poor patients who pay the price with their lives."" ""In the confrontation between the governments of the US and Iran we are getting crushed with pressures from both sides."" The health ministry has said that the country's reports to the World Health Organization regarding the number of coronavirus cases and deaths are ""transparent"" and ""far from any deviations"".

"HSBC plans to speed up job cuts after interim profits plunged and the bank said bad loans linked to the coronavirus could reach $13bn (Â£9.8bn). HSBC boss Noel Quinn said it will ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which included axing 35,000 jobs. ""Our operating environment has changed significantly since the start of the year,"" he said. Mr Quinn also said the bank would examine ""additional actions"" to strengthen its business. Europe's biggest bank reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year -  much steeper than analysts had forecast. Standard Chartered underlines Hong Kong commitment Pompeo criticises HSBC for backing HK security law HSBC to press on with 35,000 job cuts HSBC also said it set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic. This is higher than previously budgeted for, taking into account the effects of the economic downturn. The bank said it had given more than 700,000 payment holidays on loans, credit cards and mortgages, providing more than $27bn in customer relief. HSBC has also been hit by the low interest rate environment, which squeezes a bank's profit margins on the loans it provides. The lower the interest rate, the less a bank makes on its lending. In June, the UK's largest bank said it would push ahead with its plan to cut 35,000 jobs from a global workforce of 235,000 as part of a major restructuring announced in February. The job cuts had initially been put on hold during the coronavirus outbreak. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker is overseeing the programme to shrink the bankâs operations in Europe and the US. The bank has previously said it could wind down or sell its US retail banking operations which could involve shrinking its 224-strong US branch network by about 30%. While HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong. The bank is dealing with a number of challenges, including tensions between China and the west. It is currently embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong while pushing ahead with the major restructure of its global banking operations. Hong Kong's new security law: Why it scares people ""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors,"" said Mr Quinn. ""Current tensions between China and the US inevitably create challenging situations for an organisation with HSBC's footprint. ""However, the need for a bank capable of bridging the economies of east and west is acute, and we are well placed to fulfil this role."" It's Europe's largest bank, headquartered in London, but the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation makes half of its money in Asia. And it's been caught in the midst of increasingly tempestuous relations between China and the West, with the bank expressing support for China's controversial security laws in Hong Kong in June, breaking a tradition of neutrality. Chief executive Noel Quinn attempted to reinstate that neutrality today, saying: ""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors."" But who are those customers? Mr Quinn also signalled the resumption of restructuring plans which will pivot the business further towards Asia, with job cuts expected in the UK investment bank and the American branch network. Its branding is familiar around the globe, but HSBC is a bank that likes to stay out of the headlines. However, as it chases its ambitions, more pressure and scrutiny will be hard to dodge. HSBC, along with rival banking group Standard Chartered, have come under fire for their support of Chinaâs controversial national security law for Hong Kong. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and UK politicians criticised HSBC for supporting China's new legislation, which means people face prosecution for speaking out against Beijing. Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) ""browbeating"" of HSBC ""should serve as a cautionary tale"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has criticised HSBC's support for China's new security law Last week, Standard Chartered restated its commitment to Hong Kong when it released its first-half results. Standard Chartered's group chairman JosÃ© ViÃ±als said: ""We are convinced that more collaboration - not less - is the best way to find a sustainable equilibrium in these complex situations, but we do not expect an easy or quick resolution. ""We do believe, however, that Hong Kong will continue to play a key role as an international financial hub and we are fully committed to contributing to its continued success,"" he added.

"Diners across the UK will be able to enjoy half-price meals throughout August from Monday, as part of a government scheme aimed at boosting restaurants and pubs post-lockdown. ""Eat out to help out"" applies to eat-in food and drink on Monday to Wednesdays at more than 72,000 venues. The discount is capped at Â£10 per person and does not apply to alcohol. But critics said unhealthy food should have been excluded from the scheme, over fears it could fuel obesity. HM Revenue and Customs boss Jim Harra has also warnedthe scheme may not offer value for money for taxpayers. How can I use the 'eat out to help out scheme'? Most Britons still 'uncomfortable' eating out Can 'Eat out to help out' save the restaurant industry? The scheme is designed to encourage people to visit restaurants, cafes and pubs, which have been badly hit by the lockdown. Around 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed - the highest of any sector - according to government data. Many venues which have reopened since 4 July have also been forced to operate at a lower capacity to comply with social distancing rules. The offer only applies at participating eateries in areas of the UK that are not in local lockdown - but major chains including Pizza Express, Costa Coffee, McDonald's and Nando'sare among the 72,000 to have signed-up,external. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our 'eat out to help out' scheme's number one aim is to help protect the jobs of 1.8 million chefs, waiters and restaurateurs by boosting demand and getting customers through the door. ""The industry is a vital ingredient to our economy and it's been hit hard by coronavirus, so enjoy summer safely by showing your favourite places your support - we'll pay half."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the new scheme last month No vouchers are required to use the offer, with the participating establishment deducting 50% from the bill and charging the discount to the Treasury. There is no minimum spend and you can use the discount as often as you like on eligible days. However, it does not apply to takeaways. Officials said there had been more than 3.3 million hits on the ""eat out to help out""restaurant finder website since it started up last week.,external SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? The start of the scheme comes only a week after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiledthe government's new strategy to tackle obesity. Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson, the party's health spokeswoman, said with research suggesting obesity increases someone's risk of dying from coronavirus, the chancellor should have prevented people using the discount to buy junk food. ""We all recognise the need to support the high street through the pandemic, but the government should have been more discerning with this scheme,"" she said. ""With a number of fast-food chains signing up to the scheme, it seems clear that public health did not factor into the government's decision. ""The government must put public health first and exclude from the scheme meals and drinks proven to contribute to obesity. We cannot afford to risk lives as we reopen the economy."" The scheme has also drawn criticism from some anti-obesity campaigners, with the National Obesity Forum saying it would be a ""green light to promote junk food"".

"A new campaign called ""Badvertising"" is demanding an immediate end to adverts for large polluting cars. It says the government should clamp down on sports utility vehicle (SUV) car adverts in the way it curbed smoking ads. A car industry spokesperson said modern SUVs are the cleanest in history, and said many can run on batteries. But a leading academic said sales of big polluting cars will breach UK climate targets, and should be banned. A government spokesperson said: ""We are developing an ambitious transport decarbonisation plan in order to reach our goal of net zero by 2050. ""We have also provided consumers with widely-advertised incentives and information to help inform their choices when buying a vehicle."" SUVs now make up more than 4-in-10 new cars sold in UK, while fully electric vehicles account for fewer than two in a hundred. The report from the green think tank The New Weather Institute and the climate charity Possible says the trend towards big cars is propelled by aggressive advertising. They fear the global trend of rapidly-increasing sales of bigger and more polluting SUVs is jeopardising climate goals. The authors of the report point out that even electric engines wonât solve all the problems with SUVs. Thatâs because they will still pollute the air through particles rubbing off brakes and tyres, and use up carbon-emitting resources to make their heavy batteries. 'Popular choice' In urban areas, big SUVs are a particular nuisance, they say. Their report found that 150,000 new cars on the road are too big for a standard UK street parking space. It comes as local authorities strive to create space on the roads for walkers and cyclists. The authors want to outlaw advertising for cars with average emissions of over 160g CO2/km, and those exceeding 4.8m in length. Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown Electric cars are coming: but where will you recharge? Andrew Simms, one author, said: ""We ended tobacco advertising when we understood the threat from smoking to public health. ""Now that we know the human health and climate damage done by car pollution, itâs time to stop adverts making the problem worse. ""Thereâs adverts, and then thereâs badverts, promoting the biggest, worst emitting SUVs is like up-selling pollution, and we need to stop."" But Mike Hawes, from the industry's trade body, the Society of Manufacturers and Traders, told the BBC: ""SUVs are an increasingly popular choice. ""To single out a particular body type (such as SUVs) is to ignore the huge advances in emissions and powertrain technology made with every new model. ""Todayâs vehicles of all types are the cleanest in history, with average CO2 emissions from dual purpose cars being more than 43% lower than they were 20 years ago."" 'No difference' The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, is nervous of the trend towards larger vehicles. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""Making parking spaces larger would mean fewer spaces. Motorists would have to pay more for parking and wait longer for a space."" Would an ad ban work, though? Steve Gooding, from the RAC Foundation, said: ""People spending Â£70,000 on a new car are probably not swayed much by ads â theyâre attracted to the prestige brand. I suspect banning adverts wouldnât make a great deal of difference."" Whatâs more, the report is published at a difficult time for the UK car industry, which is on its knees from the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But Professor Jillian Anable, from the Leeds University Transport Studies Unit, said the government needs to see the big picture on cars - and consider banning large polluting models altogether. ""(Given our CO2 targets) there is a clear trade off to be made: the more we can shrink the size and weight of the cars we drive, the less we will have to restrict how much they are driven. ""We ought to be thinking about not allowing large polluting cars to be sold into the UK market at all."" She added: ""Our research shows an approach where the most polluting cars are phased out from now over the next 10-15 years will be more effective than the governmentâs proposed âcliff-edgeâ target date in the future where petrol and diesel cars are suddenly no longer allowed to be sold.""

"DW Sports, a gym and sports retailer, has said it will enter administration, putting 1,700 jobs at risk. The company, founded by former Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan, operated 73 gyms and 75 stores across the UK. All of its stores are to close, but DW said it would work with administrators BDO to save as many gyms as possible. Fitness First and its 43 gyms, which are part of the same group of companies, will not be affected, the firm said. Aviation and gyms 'ignored' by government ""As a consequence of Covid-19, we found ourselves in a position where we were mandated by government to close down both our retail store portfolio and our gym chain in its entirety for a protracted period, leaving us with a high fixed-cost base and zero income,"" chief executive Martin Long said. ""The decision to appoint administrators has not been taken lightly but will give us the best chance to protect viable parts of the business, return them to profitability, and secure as many jobs as possible."" Administrator BDO said its aim was to try and sell as ""much of DW Sports' business as can be achieved."" DW Sports had already closed 25 of its stores, and the firm said its remaining 50 retail sites would ""all be moving into closing down sales from today"". The DW Sports website will cease trading with immediate effect. The company said 59 of its gyms in England and Northern Ireland have reopened, while 14 are in areas restricted by localised lockdowns and are closed. Mr Long told the BBC in April that the firm's income normally totals around Â£15m a month, but that it had fallen to zero, overnight, while it still had a Â£3m monthly wage bill. Administrators BDO said gym members should contact their local gym for further information, or call the DWS Customer Service centre on 01942 311215. Creditors can register claims by emailing DWS@bdo.co.uk What's most worrying about the decision by DW sports is that its problems are far from being confined to itself: among non-food retailers, they're almost universal. They've had to deal with months when lots of money was going out (high fixed costs like rent, rates and wages) and zero money was coming in. And as DW's chief executive Martin Long points out, this government-ordered lockdown has made it ""difficult for any business to manage without long-term damage"". That's the worry - that DW's misfortune may reflect that of most of the consumer-facing sector of the economy. All retailers have been looking carefully at sales and costs since lockdown was eased and at whether any 'bounce-back' is strong and sustained enough. Clearly for DW, founded in the 1970s as JJB, it isn't. Nor was it enough for any potential buyer to be prepared to risk taking over the business as a whole. It won't be the last retail business to exhaust options, come to the same reluctant conclusion and call in administrators. The news followed Monday's announcement that HSBC is speeding up its 35,000 job losses and Friday's Byron Burger news it is axing 650 jobs and closing more than half its outlets. The number of jobs being lost because of the coronavirus crisis is accelerating, with an estimated 150,000 redundancies so far. Last week's bad news included 450 jobs disappearing at Selfridges, 650 at busmaker Alexander Dennis, 900 at Dyson, and 1,200 workers facing redundancy at the National Trust. Other lay-offs announced during the pandemic have included: Up to 5,000 job cuts at Upper Crust owner SSP Group Up to 700 jobs at Harrods About 600 workers at shirtmaker TM Lewin 1,900 jobs at CafÃ© Rouge-owner Casual Dining Group 1,000 jobs at Pret A Manger 1,700 UK jobs at plane-maker Airbus 1,300 crew and 727 pilots at EasyJet 550 jobs are going at Daily Mirror publisher Reach Mr Long spoke out about the ""limited support"" DW Sports had. ""It is a difficult model for any business to manage through without long-term damage, and with the limited support which we have been able to gain,"" he said. ""Having exhausted all other available options for the business, we firmly believe that this process can be a platform to restructure the business and preserve many of our gyms for our members, and also protect the maximum number of jobs possible for our team members.""

"America has reported around a quarter of the world's infections One of President Trump's top medical advisers has warned that the US is entering a new phase in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Deborah Birx told CNN the disease was ""extraordinarily widespread"" across the country and a greater threat than when the outbreak first began. She said it was now affecting rural areas as well as big cities. She said rural communities were not immune and should wear masks and practice social distancing. Can summer survive America's coronavirus spike? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The US has recorded more cases and deaths than any other country. According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external, more than 4.6 million infections and at least 154,834 deaths have been confirmed in America. Worldwide, nearly 18 million cases and at least 687,072 deaths have been reported. ""To everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus,"",externalsaid Dr Birx, a leading member of the White House's coronavirus task force. ""This epidemic right now is different and it's more widespread and it's both rural and urban."" Deborah Birx has urged people to return from holidays in any outbreak hotspots She also shared her concerns about people taking holidays in hot spots, citing what she had seen while visiting 14 states during the last three weeks. ""As I travelled around the country, I saw all of America moving,"" Dr Birx said. ""If you have chosen to go on vacation into a hot spot, you really need to come back and protect those with co-morbidities and assume you're infected."" America's outbreak has gained pace over the summer, particularly in southern and western states.

"Diners across the UK will be able to enjoy half-price meals throughout August from Monday, as part of a government scheme aimed at boosting restaurants and pubs post-lockdown. ""Eat out to help out"" applies to eat-in food and drink on Monday to Wednesdays at more than 72,000 venues. The discount is capped at Â£10 per person and does not apply to alcohol. But critics said unhealthy food should have been excluded from the scheme, over fears it could fuel obesity. HM Revenue and Customs boss Jim Harra has also warnedthe scheme may not offer value for money for taxpayers. How can I use the 'eat out to help out scheme'? Most Britons still 'uncomfortable' eating out Can 'Eat out to help out' save the restaurant industry? The scheme is designed to encourage people to visit restaurants, cafes and pubs, which have been badly hit by the lockdown. Around 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed - the highest of any sector - according to government data. Many venues which have reopened since 4 July have also been forced to operate at a lower capacity to comply with social distancing rules. The offer only applies at participating eateries in areas of the UK that are not in local lockdown - but major chains including Pizza Express, Costa Coffee, McDonald's and Nando'sare among the 72,000 to have signed-up,external. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our 'eat out to help out' scheme's number one aim is to help protect the jobs of 1.8 million chefs, waiters and restaurateurs by boosting demand and getting customers through the door. ""The industry is a vital ingredient to our economy and it's been hit hard by coronavirus, so enjoy summer safely by showing your favourite places your support - we'll pay half."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the new scheme last month No vouchers are required to use the offer, with the participating establishment deducting 50% from the bill and charging the discount to the Treasury. There is no minimum spend and you can use the discount as often as you like on eligible days. However, it does not apply to takeaways. Officials said there had been more than 3.3 million hits on the ""eat out to help out""restaurant finder website since it started up last week.,external SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? The start of the scheme comes only a week after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiledthe government's new strategy to tackle obesity. Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson, the party's health spokeswoman, said with research suggesting obesity increases someone's risk of dying from coronavirus, the chancellor should have prevented people using the discount to buy junk food. ""We all recognise the need to support the high street through the pandemic, but the government should have been more discerning with this scheme,"" she said. ""With a number of fast-food chains signing up to the scheme, it seems clear that public health did not factor into the government's decision. ""The government must put public health first and exclude from the scheme meals and drinks proven to contribute to obesity. We cannot afford to risk lives as we reopen the economy."" The scheme has also drawn criticism from some anti-obesity campaigners, with the National Obesity Forum saying it would be a ""green light to promote junk food"".

"Iran has been the worst-affected country in the Middle East The number of deaths from coronavirus in Iran is nearly triple what Iran's government claims, a BBC Persian service investigation has found. The government's own records appear to show almost 42,000 people died with Covid-19 symptoms up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry. The number of people known to be infected is also almost double official figures: 451,024 as opposed to 278,827. The official numbers still make Iran the worst-hit in the Middle East. In recent weeks, it has suffered a second steep rise in the number of cases. The first death in Iran from Covid-19 was recorded on 22 January, according to lists and medical records that have been passed to the BBC. This was almost a month before the first official case of coronavirus was reported there. Since the outbreak of the virus in Iran, many observers have doubted the official numbers. There have been irregularities in data between national and regional levels, which some local authorities have spoken out about,and statisticians have tried to give alternative estimates.,external. A level of undercounting, largely due to testing capacity, is seen across the world, but the information leaked to the BBC reveals Iranian authorities have reported significantly lower daily numbers despite having a record of all deaths - suggesting they were deliberately suppressed. The data was sent to the BBC by an anonymous source. It includes details of daily admissions to hospitals across Iran, including names, age, gender, symptoms, date and length of periods spent in hospital, and underlying conditions patients might have. The details on lists correspond to those of some living and deceased patients already known to the BBC. This video can not be played Iran's deputy health minister gets coronavirus The source says they have shared this data with the BBC to ""shed light on truth"" and to end ""political games"" over the epidemic. The discrepancy between the official figures and the number of deaths on these records also matches the difference between the official figure and calculations of excess mortality until mid-June. Excess mortality refers to the number of deaths above and beyond what would be expected under ""normal"" conditions. Tehran, the capital, has the highest number of deaths with 8,120 people who died with Covid-19 or symptoms similar to it. The city of Qom, the initial epicentre of the virus in Iran, is worst hit proportionally, with 1,419 deaths - that is one death with Covid-19 for every 1,000 people. It is notable that, across the country, 1,916 deaths were non-Iranian nationals. This indicates a disproportionate number of deaths amongst migrants and refugees, who are mostly from neighbouring Afghanistan. The overall trend of cases and deaths in the leaked data is similar to official reports, albeit different in size. The initial rise of deaths is far steeper than Health Ministry figures and by mid-March it was five times the official figure. Lockdown measures were imposed over the Nowruz (Iranian New Year) holidays at the end of the third week in March, and there was a corresponding decline in cases and deaths. Iran has introduced measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus But as government restrictions were relaxed, the cases and deaths started to rise again after late-May. Crucially the first recorded death on the leaked list occurred on 22 January, a month before the first case of coronavirus was officially reported in Iran. At the time Health Ministry officials were adamant in acknowledging not a single case of coronavirus in the country, despite reports by journalists inside Iran, and warnings from various medical professionals. In 28 days until the first official acknowledgement on 19 February, 52 people had already died. Doctors with direct knowledge of the matter have told the BBC that the Iranian health ministry has been under pressure from security and intelligence bodies inside Iran. Dr Pouladi (not their real name) told the BBC that the ministry ""was in denial"". ""Initially they did not have testing kits and when they got them, they weren't used widely enough. The position of the security services was not to admit to the existence of coronavirus in Iran,"" Dr Pouladi said. It was the persistence of two brothers, both doctors from Qom, which forced the health ministry to acknowledge the first official case. When Dr Mohammad Molayi and Dr Ali Molayi lost their brother, they insisted he should still be tested for Covid-19, which turned out to be positive. In Kamkar hospital, where their brother died, numerous patients were admitted with similar symptoms to Covid-19, and they would not respond to the usual treatments. Nevertheless, none of them were tested for the disease. Dr Pouladi says: ""They got unlucky. Someone with both decency and influence lost his brother. Dr Molayi had access to these gentlemen [health ministry officials] and did not give up."" Dr Molayi released a video of his late brother with a statement. The health ministry then finally acknowledged the first recorded case. Nevertheless state TV ran a report criticising him and falsely claiming the video of his brother was months old. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Iran mortuary worker cleanses bodies The start of outbreak coincided both with the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and with parliamentary elections. These were major opportunities for the Islamic Republic to demonstrate its popular support and not risk damaging it because of the virus. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, accused some of wanting to use the coronavirus to undermine the election. In the event, the election had a very low turnout. Iran's cover-up after it shot down a Ukrainian airliner fuelled anti-government protests Before the global coronavirus pandemic hit, Iran was already experiencing a series of its own crises. In November 2019, the government increased the price of petrol overnight and cracked down violently on protests which followed. Hundreds of protesters were killed in a few days. In January this year, the Iranian response to the US assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, seen as one of the most powerful figures in Iran after its Supreme Leader, created another problem. Then Iranian armed forces - on high alert - mistakenly fired missiles at a Ukrainian airliner only minutes after it had taken off from Tehran's international airport. All 176 people on board were killed. The Iranian authorities initially tried to cover up what happened, but after three days they were forced to admit it, resulting in considerable loss of face. This video can not be played Flight tracking data and open source footage shows how Mahan Air continued to fly Dr Nouroldin Pirmoazzen, a former MP who also was an official at the health ministry, told the BBC that in this context, the Iranian government was ""anxious and fearful of the truth"" when coronavirus hit Iran. He said: ""The government was afraid that the poor and the unemployed would take to the streets."" Dr Pirmoazzen points to the fact thatIran stopped international health organisation MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res from treating coronavirus cases in the central province of Isfahan,externalas evidence of how security-conscious its approach towards the pandemic is. Iran was going through tough times even before the military showdown with the US and coronavirus hit. The sanctions which followed Donald Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal in May 2018 hit the economy hard. Dr Pouladi says: ""Those who brought the country to this point don't pay the price. It is the poor people of the country and my poor patients who pay the price with their lives."" ""In the confrontation between the governments of the US and Iran we are getting crushed with pressures from both sides.""

"Diners across the UK will be able to enjoy half-price meals throughout August from Monday, as part of a government scheme aimed at boosting restaurants and pubs post-lockdown. ""Eat out to help out"" applies to eat-in food and drink on Monday to Wednesdays at more than 72,000 venues. The discount is capped at Â£10 per person and does not apply to alcohol. But critics said unhealthy food should have been excluded from the scheme, over fears it could fuel obesity. HM Revenue and Customs boss Jim Harra has also warnedthe scheme may not offer value for money for taxpayers. How can I use the 'eat out to help out scheme'? Most Britons still 'uncomfortable' eating out Can 'Eat out to help out' save the restaurant industry? The scheme is designed to encourage people to visit restaurants, cafes and pubs, which have been badly hit by the lockdown. Around 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed - the highest of any sector - according to government data. Many venues which have reopened since 4 July have also been forced to operate at a lower capacity to comply with social distancing rules. The offer only applies at participating eateries in areas of the UK that are not in local lockdown - but major chains including Pizza Express, Costa Coffee, McDonald's and Nando'sare among the 72,000 to have signed-up,external. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our 'eat out to help out' scheme's number one aim is to help protect the jobs of 1.8 million chefs, waiters and restaurateurs by boosting demand and getting customers through the door. ""The industry is a vital ingredient to our economy and it's been hit hard by coronavirus, so enjoy summer safely by showing your favourite places your support - we'll pay half."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the new scheme last month No vouchers are required to use the offer, with the participating establishment deducting 50% from the bill and charging the discount to the Treasury. There is no minimum spend and you can use the discount as often as you like on eligible days. However, it does not apply to takeaways. Officials said there had been more than 3.3 million hits on the ""eat out to help out""restaurant finder website since it started up last week.,external SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? The start of the scheme comes only a week after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiledthe government's new strategy to tackle obesity. Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson, the party's health spokeswoman, said with research suggesting obesity increases someone's risk of dying from coronavirus, the chancellor should have prevented people using the discount to buy junk food. ""We all recognise the need to support the high street through the pandemic, but the government should have been more discerning with this scheme,"" she said. ""With a number of fast-food chains signing up to the scheme, it seems clear that public health did not factor into the government's decision. ""The government must put public health first and exclude from the scheme meals and drinks proven to contribute to obesity. We cannot afford to risk lives as we reopen the economy."" The scheme has also drawn criticism from some anti-obesity campaigners, with the National Obesity Forum saying it would be a ""green light to promote junk food"".

He died in a Londonderry nursing home following a long period of illness. One of the highest-profile politicians in Northern Ireland for more than 30 years, he helped create the climate that brought an end to the Troubles. He was a founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in 1970 and led the party from 1979 until 2001.

David Trimble, U2 singer Bono and John Hume campaigning for the peace deal in 1998 He was widely admired for his steadfast commitment to peaceful, democratic politics during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Tributes have been paid by political leaders past and present, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was in office when the peace deal was signed. Mr Blair said he was ""a visionary who refused to believe the future had to be the same as the past"".

""With his enduring sense of honour, he kept marching on against all odds towards a brighter future for all the children of Northern Ireland.

He said Mr Hume's vision ""paved the way for the stability, positivity and dynamism of the Northern Ireland of today"". SDLP co-founder Austin Currie said ""John Hume is the greatest Irishman since Parnell"". ""His place in Irish history is richly deserved. Hume's consistency provided a compass through some terrible times,"" he said. In the late 1980s, Mr Hume took considerable risks for peace byholding talks with the then leader of Sinn FÃ©in, Gerry Adams.,external The talks were controversial because the IRA was still heavily involved in violence, but Mr Hume's aim was to persuade republicans to commit to exclusively democratic means. The Hume-Adams talks helped to lay the foundations for the1994 IRA ceasefire,externaland later negotiations which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement. John Hume faced enormous criticism for his decision to hold talks with Gerry Adams Mr Adams said he was ""a political leader genuinely prepared to look at the bigger picture and to put the wider interests of society above narrow party politics"". He said his decision to meet him was a ""breakthrough moment in Irish politics"". ""When others were stuck in the ritual politics of condemnation, John Hume had the courage to take real risks for peace,"" he added.

And with patience, resilience and unswerving commitment, he triumphed and delivered a victory for peace,"" he said. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster described the former SDLP leader as a ""giant in Irish nationalism"". ""In our darkest days he recognised that violence was the wrong path and worked steadfastly to promote democratic politics,"" the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader added. Following the 1998 peace deal, Mr Hume was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with the then leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble. John Hume and David Trimble were presented with doves of peace sculptures Lord Trimble said from the outset Mr Hume urged people to stick to their objective peacefully. ""He was a major contributor to politics in Northern Ireland, particularly to the process that gave us an agreement that we are still working our way through,"" he said.

"Iran has been the worst-affected country in the Middle East The number of deaths from coronavirus in Iran is nearly triple what Iran's government claims, a BBC Persian service investigation has found. The government's own records appear to show almost 42,000 people died with Covid-19 symptoms up to 20 July, versus 14,405 reported by its health ministry. The number of people known to be infected is also almost double official figures: 451,024 as opposed to 278,827. The official numbers still make Iran the worst-hit in the Middle East. In recent weeks, it has suffered a second steep rise in the number of cases. The first death in Iran from Covid-19 was recorded on 22 January, according to lists and medical records that have been passed to the BBC. This was almost a month before the first official case of coronavirus was reported there. Since the outbreak of the virus in Iran, many observers have doubted the official numbers. There have been irregularities in data between national and regional levels, which some local authorities have spoken out about,and statisticians have tried to give alternative estimates.,external. A level of undercounting, largely due to testing capacity, is seen across the world, but the information leaked to the BBC reveals Iranian authorities have reported significantly lower daily numbers despite having a record of all deaths - suggesting they were deliberately suppressed. The data was sent to the BBC by an anonymous source. It includes details of daily admissions to hospitals across Iran, including names, age, gender, symptoms, date and length of periods spent in hospital, and underlying conditions patients might have. The details on lists correspond to those of some living and deceased patients already known to the BBC. This video can not be played Iran's deputy health minister gets coronavirus The source says they have shared this data with the BBC to ""shed light on truth"" and to end ""political games"" over the epidemic. The discrepancy between the official figures and the number of deaths on these records also matches the difference between the official figure and calculations of excess mortality until mid-June. Excess mortality refers to the number of deaths above and beyond what would be expected under ""normal"" conditions. Tehran, the capital, has the highest number of deaths with 8,120 people who died with Covid-19 or symptoms similar to it. The city of Qom, the initial epicentre of the virus in Iran, is worst hit proportionally, with 1,419 deaths - that is one death with Covid-19 for every 1,000 people. It is notable that, across the country, 1,916 deaths were non-Iranian nationals. This indicates a disproportionate number of deaths amongst migrants and refugees, who are mostly from neighbouring Afghanistan. The overall trend of cases and deaths in the leaked data is similar to official reports, albeit different in size. The initial rise of deaths is far steeper than Health Ministry figures and by mid-March it was five times the official figure. Lockdown measures were imposed over the Nowruz (Iranian New Year) holidays at the end of the third week in March, and there was a corresponding decline in cases and deaths. Iran has introduced measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus But as government restrictions were relaxed, the cases and deaths started to rise again after late-May. Crucially the first recorded death on the leaked list occurred on 22 January, a month before the first case of coronavirus was officially reported in Iran. At the time Health Ministry officials were adamant in acknowledging not a single case of coronavirus in the country, despite reports by journalists inside Iran, and warnings from various medical professionals. In 28 days until the first official acknowledgement on 19 February, 52 people had already died. Doctors with direct knowledge of the matter have told the BBC that the Iranian health ministry has been under pressure from security and intelligence bodies inside Iran. Dr Pouladi (not their real name) told the BBC that the ministry ""was in denial"". ""Initially they did not have testing kits and when they got them, they weren't used widely enough. The position of the security services was not to admit to the existence of coronavirus in Iran,"" Dr Pouladi said. It was the persistence of two brothers, both doctors from Qom, which forced the health ministry to acknowledge the first official case. When Dr Mohammad Molayi and Dr Ali Molayi lost their brother, they insisted he should still be tested for Covid-19, which turned out to be positive. In Kamkar hospital, where their brother died, numerous patients were admitted with similar symptoms to Covid-19, and they would not respond to the usual treatments. Nevertheless, none of them were tested for the disease. Dr Pouladi says: ""They got unlucky. Someone with both decency and influence lost his brother. Dr Molayi had access to these gentlemen [health ministry officials] and did not give up."" Dr Molayi released a video of his late brother with a statement. The health ministry then finally acknowledged the first recorded case. Nevertheless state TV ran a report criticising him and falsely claiming the video of his brother was months old. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Iran mortuary worker cleanses bodies The start of outbreak coincided both with the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and with parliamentary elections. These were major opportunities for the Islamic Republic to demonstrate its popular support and not risk damaging it because of the virus. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, accused some of wanting to use the coronavirus to undermine the election. In the event, the election had a very low turnout. Iran's cover-up after it shot down a Ukrainian airliner fuelled anti-government protests Before the global coronavirus pandemic hit, Iran was already experiencing a series of its own crises. In November 2019, the government increased the price of petrol overnight and cracked down violently on protests which followed. Hundreds of protesters were killed in a few days. In January this year, the Iranian response to the US assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, seen as one of the most powerful figures in Iran after its Supreme Leader, created another problem. Then Iranian armed forces - on high alert - mistakenly fired missiles at a Ukrainian airliner only minutes after it had taken off from Tehran's international airport. All 176 people on board were killed. The Iranian authorities initially tried to cover up what happened, but after three days they were forced to admit it, resulting in considerable loss of face.

"HSBC plans to speed up job cuts after interim profits plunged and the bank said bad loans linked to the coronavirus could reach $13bn (Â£9.8bn). HSBC boss Noel Quinn said it will ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which included axing 35,000 jobs. ""Our operating environment has changed significantly since the start of the year,"" he said. Mr Quinn also said the bank would examine ""additional actions"" to strengthen its business. Europe's biggest bank reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year -  much steeper than analysts had forecast. Standard Chartered underlines Hong Kong commitment Pompeo criticises HSBC for backing HK security law HSBC to press on with 35,000 job cuts HSBC also said it set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic. This is higher than previously budgeted for, taking into account the effects of the economic downturn. The bank said it had given more than 700,000 payment holidays on loans, credit cards and mortgages, providing more than $27bn in customer relief. HSBC has also been hit by the low interest rate environment, which squeezes a bank's profit margins on the loans it provides. The lower the interest rate, the less a bank makes on its lending. In June, the UK's largest bank said it would push ahead with its plan to cut 35,000 jobs from a global workforce of 235,000 as part of a major restructuring announced in February. The job cuts had initially been put on hold during the coronavirus outbreak. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker is overseeing the programme to shrink the bankâs operations in Europe and the US. The bank has previously said it could wind down or sell its US retail banking operations which could involve shrinking its 224-strong US branch network by about 30%. While HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong. The bank is dealing with a number of challenges, including tensions between China and the west. It is currently embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong while pushing ahead with the major restructure of its global banking operations. Hong Kong's new security law: Why it scares people ""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors,"" said Mr Quinn. ""Current tensions between China and the US inevitably create challenging situations for an organisation with HSBC's footprint. ""However, the need for a bank capable of bridging the economies of east and west is acute, and we are well placed to fulfil this role."" It's Europe's largest bank, headquartered in London, but the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation makes half of its money in Asia. And it's been caught in the midst of increasingly tempestuous relations between China and the West, with the bank expressing support for China's controversial security laws in Hong Kong in June, breaking a tradition of neutrality. Chief executive Noel Quinn attempted to reinstate that neutrality today, saying: ""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors."" But who are those customers? Mr Quinn also signalled the resumption of restructuring plans which will pivot the business further towards Asia, with job cuts expected in the UK investment bank and the American branch network. Its branding is familiar around the globe, but HSBC is a bank that likes to stay out of the headlines. However, as it chases its ambitions, more pressure and scrutiny will be hard to dodge. HSBC, along with rival banking group Standard Chartered, have come under fire for their support of Chinaâs controversial national security law for Hong Kong. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and UK politicians criticised HSBC for supporting China's new legislation, which means people face prosecution for speaking out against Beijing. Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) ""browbeating"" of HSBC ""should serve as a cautionary tale"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has criticised HSBC's support for China's new security law Last week, Standard Chartered restated its commitment to Hong Kong when it released its first-half results. Standard Chartered's group chairman JosÃ© ViÃ±als said: ""We are convinced that more collaboration - not less - is the best way to find a sustainable equilibrium in these complex situations, but we do not expect an easy or quick resolution. ""We do believe, however, that Hong Kong will continue to play a key role as an international financial hub and we are fully committed to contributing to its continued success,"" he added.

"This video can not be played ""Thank you for flying SpaceX"" - Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken return to Earth Two American astronauts have splashed down, as the first commercial crewed mission to the International Space Station returned to Earth. The SpaceX Dragon Capsule carrying Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken came down in the Gulf of Mexico just south of Pensacola on Florida's Gulf coast. A recovery vessel moved in to pick up the vehicle and extricate the men. The touchdown marks the first crewed US water landing since the final outing of an Apollo command module 45 years ago. Hurley's and Behnken's capsule hit the water at about 14:48 EDT (19:48 BST; 18:48 GMT). Private boats which came close to the Dragon were asked to leave amid concern over hazardous chemicals venting from the capsule's propulsion system. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said the presence of the boats ""was not what we were anticipating"". ""What is not common is having passersby approach the vehicle close range with nitrogen tetroxide in the atmosphere; that's not something that is good,"" he said. ""And we need to make sure that we're warning people not to get close to the spacecraft in the future."" Photos of the boats were shared on social media. Allow Twitter content?

The successful end to the crew's mission initiates a new era for the American space agency. All its human transport needs just above the Earth will in future be purchased from private companies, such as SpaceX. The government agency says contracting out to service providers in this way will save it billions of dollars that can be diverted to getting astronauts to the Moon, as part of its Artemis programme, and afterwards to Mars. The Dragon capsule launched to the space station at the end of May on a Falcon 9 rocket, also supplied by SpaceX. Hurley's and Behnken's mission served as an end-to-end demonstration of the astronaut ""taxi service"" the company, owned by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, will be selling to Nasa from now on. The Boeing corporation is also developing a crew capsule solution but has had to delay its introduction after encountering software problems on its Starliner vehicle. The sight of the vehicle's four main parachutes floating down over the Gulf of Mexico was confirmation the spacecraft had survived its high-speed, fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. The parachutes were required to further slow the capsule from about 350mph (560km/h) to just roughly 15mph (7m/s) at splashdown. Rigging was used to hoist the capsule out of the water and on to the recovery vessel. Technicians monitored ""remnant vapours"" around the spacecraft before the hatch was opened. The men were checked over by medical staff before being flown to shore by helicopter. Who are Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken? How is Nasa using commercial partners? This video can not be played What is SpaceX and why is it working with Nasa? The astronauts' Dragon capsule launched to the space station at the end of May on a Falcon 9 rocket, also supplied by SpaceX. It will now be refurbished to fly again next year. Mr Bridenstine lauded the efforts of everyone involved in Hurley's and Behnken's mission, and then spoke of his agency's shift in philosophy. ""We don't want to purchase, own and operate the hardware the way we used to,"" he said. ""We want to be one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in low-Earth orbit. But we also want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation and safety, and really create this virtuous cycle of economic development and capability."" Gwynne Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, added: ""Today is a great day. We should celebrate what we all accomplished here, bringing Bob and Doug back, but we should also think about this as a springboard to doing even harder things with the Artemis programme. And then, of course, moving on to Mars.""

"US tech giant Microsoft has confirmed that it is continuing talks to purchase the US operations of Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella had a conversation with President Donald Trump about the acquisition on Sunday, the tech firm said. Microsoft stressed that it ""fully appreciates the importance"" of addressing President Trump's concerns. A full security review of the app will be conducted, the company added. Microsoft will also have to provide the US government with a list of the ""proper economic benefits"" to the country, it said in ablog post,external. The tech giant hopes to conclude discussions with TikTok's parent firm ByteDance by 15 September. TikTok hits back after Trump threatens US ban How would the US go about banning TikTok? Should we be worried about TikTok? Microsoft said it was looking to purchase the TikTok service in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and would operate the app in these markets. The tech firm added that it ""may"" invite other American investors to participate in the purchase ""on a minority basis"". Microsoft emphasised that it would ensure that ""all private data of TikTok's American users"" was transferred to and remained in the US. Further, it would ensure that any data currently stored or backed up outside the country would be deleted from servers after it was transferred to US data centres. It also said that Microsoft ""appreciates the US Government's and President Trump's personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country."" But the tech giant added that current discussions were still in the ""preliminary"" stage, and as such there was ""no assurance"" that the purchase would proceed. A possible sale of TikTok's US operations to Microsoft was thought to be on hold after Donald Trump vowed to ban the video-sharing app, according to aWall Street Journal report,external. The potential sale had been seen close to agreement but was put in doubt after the US president's warning on Friday. And on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that President Trumpwould take action ""in the coming days"" against Chinese-owned softwarethat he believed to pose a national security risk. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Pompeo said the action would be taken ""with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party"". Short-form video app TikTok is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide - and about 80 million in the US - with a huge proportion of these in their teens or early 20s. This video can not be played WATCH: Will TikTok be banned? Some US politicians are worried the app's Chinese owner ByteDance poses a risk to national security because it could be used to collect Americans' personal data. Regulators have also raised their own safety concerns. Late on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ""As far as TikTok is concerned we're banning them from the United States."" And in a statement on Saturday, a White House spokesman said: ""The administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy."" The Wall Street Journal said ByteDance tried to make significant concessions to the White House, including creating thousands of jobs over three years. A sale of the US operation to Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, would give the US tech giant a far greater presence in social media, an area dominated by rivals. The value of TikTok's US arm has been put at between $15bn and $30bn (Â£11bn-Â£23bn). According to the Financial Times,external, some executives at ByteDance believe Mr Trump's intervention may just be a negotiating ploy to help Microsoft secure a better deal. TikTok declined to discuss the possible Microsoft deal, but a spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday: ""While we do not comment on rumours or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok."" The statement re-iterated that the company was committed to protecting the privacy and safety of users. The move to ban TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The president's announcement on Friday was criticised by some in the tech sector, including former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, who questioned whether the move was spurred by national security concerns. He tweeted: ""This is getting bizarre. A 100% sale to an American company would have been considered a radical solution two week ago and, eventually, mitigates any reasonable data protection concerns. If the White House kills this we know this isn't about national security."" Mr Trump was also criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Banning an app that millions of Americans use to communicate with each other is a danger to free expression and is technologically impractical,"" said the ACLU's surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, Jennifer Granick. ""Shutting one platform down, even if it were legally possible to do so, harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance,"" she said. On Saturday, in a bid to reassure TikTok's millions of US users,Vanessa Pappas, the country's general manager said in a video message: ""We're not going anywhereâ.â.â. We're here for the long run. ""When it comes to safety and security, we're building the safest app because we know it's the right thing to do. So we appreciate the support.""

"America has reported around a quarter of the world's infections One of President Trump's top medical advisers has warned that the US is entering a new phase in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Deborah Birx told CNN the disease was ""extraordinarily widespread"" across the country and a greater threat than when the outbreak first began. She said it was now affecting rural areas as well as big cities. She said rural communities were not immune and should wear masks and practice social distancing. Can summer survive America's coronavirus spike? Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? The US has recorded more cases and deaths than any other country. According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University,external, more than 4.6 million infections and at least 154,834 deaths have been confirmed in America. Worldwide, nearly 18 million cases and at least 687,072 deaths have been reported. ""To everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus,"",externalsaid Dr Birx, a leading member of the White House's coronavirus task force. ""This epidemic right now is different and it's more widespread and it's both rural and urban."" Deborah Birx has urged people to return from holidays in any outbreak hotspots She also shared her concerns about people taking holidays in hot spots, citing what she had seen while visiting 14 states during the last three weeks. ""As I travelled around the country, I saw all of America moving,"" Dr Birx said. ""If you have chosen to go on vacation into a hot spot, you really need to come back and protect those with co-morbidities and assume you're infected."" America's outbreak has gained pace over the summer, particularly in southern and western states. In another development,US House Speaker and leading Democrat Nancy Pelosi attacked Dr Birx, linking her to ""disinformation"" spread by President Trump.

"A new campaign called ""Badvertising"" is demanding an immediate end to adverts for large polluting cars. It says the government should clamp down on sports utility vehicle (SUV) car adverts in the way it curbed smoking ads. A car industry spokesperson said modern SUVs are the cleanest in history, and said many can run on batteries. But a leading academic said sales of big polluting cars will breach UK climate targets, and should be banned. A government spokesperson said: ""We are developing an ambitious transport decarbonisation plan in order to reach our goal of net zero by 2050. ""We have also provided consumers with widely-advertised incentives and information to help inform their choices when buying a vehicle."" SUVs now make up more than 4-in-10 new cars sold in UK, while fully electric vehicles account for fewer than two in a hundred. The report from the green think tank The New Weather Institute and the climate charity Possible says the trend towards big cars is propelled by aggressive advertising. They fear the global trend of rapidly-increasing sales of bigger and more polluting SUVs is jeopardising climate goals. The authors of the report point out that even electric engines wonât solve all the problems with SUVs. Thatâs because they will still pollute the air through particles rubbing off brakes and tyres, and use up carbon-emitting resources to make their heavy batteries. 'Popular choice' In urban areas, big SUVs are a particular nuisance, they say. Their report found that 150,000 new cars on the road are too big for a standard UK street parking space. It comes as local authorities strive to create space on the roads for walkers and cyclists. The authors want to outlaw advertising for cars with average emissions of over 160g CO2/km, and those exceeding 4.8m in length. Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown Electric cars are coming: but where will you recharge? Andrew Simms, one author, said: ""We ended tobacco advertising when we understood the threat from smoking to public health. ""Now that we know the human health and climate damage done by car pollution, itâs time to stop adverts making the problem worse. ""Thereâs adverts, and then thereâs badverts, promoting the biggest, worst emitting SUVs is like up-selling pollution, and we need to stop."" But Mike Hawes, from the industry's trade body, the Society of Manufacturers and Traders, told the BBC: ""SUVs are an increasingly popular choice. ""To single out a particular body type (such as SUVs) is to ignore the huge advances in emissions and powertrain technology made with every new model. ""Todayâs vehicles of all types are the cleanest in history, with average CO2 emissions from dual purpose cars being more than 43% lower than they were 20 years ago."" 'No difference' The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, is nervous of the trend towards larger vehicles. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""Making parking spaces larger would mean fewer spaces. Motorists would have to pay more for parking and wait longer for a space."" Would an ad ban work, though? Steve Gooding, from the RAC Foundation, said: ""People spending Â£70,000 on a new car are probably not swayed much by ads â theyâre attracted to the prestige brand. I suspect banning adverts wouldnât make a great deal of difference."" Whatâs more, the report is published at a difficult time for the UK car industry, which is on its knees from the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But Professor Jillian Anable, from the Leeds University Transport Studies Unit, said the government needs to see the big picture on cars - and consider banning large polluting models altogether. ""(Given our CO2 targets) there is a clear trade off to be made: the more we can shrink the size and weight of the cars we drive, the less we will have to restrict how much they are driven. ""We ought to be thinking about not allowing large polluting cars to be sold into the UK market at all."" She added: ""Our research shows an approach where the most polluting cars are phased out from now over the next 10-15 years will be more effective than the governmentâs proposed âcliff-edgeâ target date in the future where petrol and diesel cars are suddenly no longer allowed to be sold.""

"This video can not be played Ghulam Abbas was working in the weeks before he caught Covid-19 Institutional racism may have contributed to the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on ethnic minorities in Wales, a top judge has claimed. Judge Ray Singh, who led the Welsh government's response to the issue, also said lives could have been saved if an online risk-assessment had been made available sooner. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has called for a public inquiry. The Welsh government said it was trying to tackle structural racism. In the last 20 years, at least 10 UK-wide reports have highlighted health inequalities in Wales, research by BBC Wales Investigates has found. Analysis of official data shows people from ethnic minority backgrounds in Wales are more likely than white people to live in areas where deprivation has worsened since 2011. According toONS statistics,external, between March and the end of June, the Covid-19 mortality rate in the most-deprived fifth of areas in Wales was nearly twice as high as in the least-deprived areas. Ethnic minority workers are alsomore likely to have zero-hours contracts or work for agencies,external, meaning they are under pressure to keep working despite the danger posed by the virus. Nicola Mincher told her partner Raza Ghulam she did not want him going into work, but he said he could not afford time off In March, after Covid-19 started to spread, Raza Ghulam, 54, was working as a warehouse manager and looking after his parents on his days off. Raza's partner, Nicola Mincher, 49, from Newport, told him she did not want him going into work, but he said he could not afford time off. Wales 'may have had more time to prepare' for virus 'Lack of action on racism' highlighted by pandemic Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales They both fell ill just before lockdown started and, within two days, Nicola had to call an ambulance because Raza was having trouble breathing. ""As he was leaving he said 'people don't come home from this',"" said Nicola. ""I said 'don't talk like that'. I gave him a kiss. ""It's the last time I spoke to him."" Nicola Mincher says her world fell apart when her partner died In hospital, Raza tested positive for coronavirus and was put on a ventilator. Then his brother Ghulam Abbas, 59, a taxi driver from Newport, also caught Covid-19 and the brothers both ended up in the Royal Gwent Hospital's intensive care ward. On 22 April, Nicola was called into the hospital to see Raza. ""I gave him a kiss on the cheek and I was holding his hands with his prayer beads and within five minutes they said his heart stopped,"" she said. ""They said 'he's gone' and my world just collapsed."" Raza's brother Ghulam died 12 hours later. His wife, Shamim Abbas, 60, said: ""We loved him so much. My daughters, to them, he wasn't their dad, he was their hero. ""We've always worked, every day, and I said to him, 'it's time to have some time for me and you', and that's what we were planning. But God has other plans."" Ghulam Abbas, pictured with his wife Shamim, ended up in intensive care at the same time as his brother In the first wave of Covid-19, 16 health and social care workers in Wales died.Seven were Filipino. In April, healthcare support worker Julius Sana went into hospital suffering with a fever. A day later, on his daughter Princess' fifth birthday, he was put on a ventilator. He had accompanied a patient into hospital who later tested positive for coronavirus. Julius was, according to his sister Jovelyn Villareal, 44, proud of his job. ""He was a person that didn't want people to think he's lazy,"" she said. Julius Sana, pictured with his wife Maricar, son Marc and daughter Princess, was intubated for 18 days Julius had diabetes, a risk factor in the pandemic, and although he had some personal protective equipment (PPE), it was fairly basic, in line with government guidance at the time. ""In the beginning we were asking - is this enough?"" said Jovelyn. ""We saw on the TV, in places like China or in the Philippines, they were wearing full PPE like they were astronauts."" Julius was intubated for 18 days. Then his wife Maricar, 40, was called to say he was having a cardiac arrest. The 40 year-old died within 10 minutes. Julius Sana's sister Jovelyn Villareal, pictured with his wife Maricar, has questioned whether he had adequate PPE Stories like those of Raza, Ghulam and Julius are familiar to Shavanah Taj, of the TUC. ""Many people said openly, right from the start, 'we are really scared. When we see the images on the TV screens and on our media, we know that we are disproportionately impacted. But when I've got to make a choice between putting food on the table and paying my bills - what do you think I'm going to do?'."" She said many workers from ethnic minority backgrounds also have visa requirements to work a certain number of hours or are in a position where they have to take on extra shifts. Ms Taj said she wanted a public inquiry into why ethnic minorities were disproportionately affected. ""Many people have lost loved ones, friends and colleagues. We need to know whether that could have been avoided,"" she said. Shavanah Taj from the TUC wants a public inquiry into whether ethnic minorities could have been better protected Across the board, the statistics illustrate how vulnerable some ethnic minorities were. One third of medical and dental staff in Wales are from BAME backgrounds. Poverty has also hit some communities harder as businesses closed in the pandemic. Pakistani, black African and black Caribbean men aremore likely to work in industries that shut during lockdown,external. Bangladeshi men are four times more likely to be in these industries than white men. Judge Ray Singh says Covid-19 has exposed ""embedded racism"" in Wales In April, the Welsh government set up an advisory group to look at why ethnic minorities were at risk as the virus spread. It was headed by Judge Singh who, early in the process, oversaw the development of anonline risk assessment,externalwhich takes into account risk factors linked to coronavirus, such as ethnicity, gender and illness. He believes it could have made a difference had it been available early on. ""It would have helped a lot. So many of those people may still be alive today,"" he said. ""The embedded racism is being exposed here,"" he added. ""And we need to act upon it now, as otherwise it will be too late."" In the last two decades at least 10 UK-wide reports have highlighted health inequalities in Wales, some pointing to the impact on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Jane Hutt said: ""We didn't know what the impact of Covid-19 would be as a virus, but we knew about socio-economic inequalities. ""We've got to accept that there are structural inequalities."" The report also highlighted the lack of ethnic minority representation in decision-making roles. Ms Hutt said, just before lockdown, the government had launched an equality and diversity inclusion strategy for public appointments. Asked if she would support a public inquiry, she said: ""I think we should implement the action plan that we're delivering on the race equality strategy. ""We've got to accept that there are structural inequalities and there's racism. There's absolutely no way that we should be either complacent or think this doesn't apply to us in Wales.""

"A new campaign called ""Badvertising"" is demanding an immediate end to adverts for large polluting cars. It says the government should clamp down on sports utility vehicle (SUV) car adverts in the way it curbed smoking ads. A car industry spokesperson said modern SUVs are the cleanest in history, and said many can run on batteries. But a leading academic said sales of big polluting cars will breach UK climate targets, and should be banned. A government spokesperson said: ""We are developing an ambitious transport decarbonisation plan in order to reach our goal of net zero by 2050. ""We have also provided consumers with widely-advertised incentives and information to help inform their choices when buying a vehicle."" SUVs now make up more than 4-in-10 new cars sold in UK, while fully electric vehicles account for fewer than two in a hundred. The report from the green think tank The New Weather Institute and the climate charity Possible says the trend towards big cars is propelled by aggressive advertising. They fear the global trend of rapidly-increasing sales of bigger and more polluting SUVs is jeopardising climate goals. The authors of the report point out that even electric engines wonât solve all the problems with SUVs. Thatâs because they will still pollute the air through particles rubbing off brakes and tyres, and use up carbon-emitting resources to make their heavy batteries. 'Popular choice' In urban areas, big SUVs are a particular nuisance, they say. Their report found that 150,000 new cars on the road are too big for a standard UK street parking space. It comes as local authorities strive to create space on the roads for walkers and cyclists. The authors want to outlaw advertising for cars with average emissions of over 160g CO2/km, and those exceeding 4.8m in length. Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown Electric cars are coming: but where will you recharge? Andrew Simms, one author, said: ""We ended tobacco advertising when we understood the threat from smoking to public health. ""Now that we know the human health and climate damage done by car pollution, itâs time to stop adverts making the problem worse. ""Thereâs adverts, and then thereâs badverts, promoting the biggest, worst emitting SUVs is like up-selling pollution, and we need to stop."" But Mike Hawes, from the industry's trade body, the Society of Manufacturers and Traders, told the BBC: ""SUVs are an increasingly popular choice. ""To single out a particular body type (such as SUVs) is to ignore the huge advances in emissions and powertrain technology made with every new model. ""Todayâs vehicles of all types are the cleanest in history, with average CO2 emissions from dual purpose cars being more than 43% lower than they were 20 years ago."" 'No difference' The Local Government Association, which represents local councils, is nervous of the trend towards larger vehicles. A spokesperson told the BBC: ""Making parking spaces larger would mean fewer spaces. Motorists would have to pay more for parking and wait longer for a space."" Would an ad ban work, though? Steve Gooding, from the RAC Foundation, said: ""People spending Â£70,000 on a new car are probably not swayed much by ads â theyâre attracted to the prestige brand. I suspect banning adverts wouldnât make a great deal of difference."" Whatâs more, the report is published at a difficult time for the UK car industry, which is on its knees from the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But Professor Jillian Anable, from the Leeds University Transport Studies Unit, said the government needs to see the big picture on cars - and consider banning large polluting models altogether. ""(Given our CO2 targets) there is a clear trade off to be made: the more we can shrink the size and weight of the cars we drive, the less we will have to restrict how much they are driven. ""We ought to be thinking about not allowing large polluting cars to be sold into the UK market at all."" She added: ""Our research shows an approach where the most polluting cars are phased out from now over the next 10-15 years will be more effective than the governmentâs proposed âcliff-edgeâ target date in the future where petrol and diesel cars are suddenly no longer allowed to be sold.""

"The gap between how much people earn in London and the rest of the country has narrowed since the early 2000s, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). According to the think tank, the geographic inequalities in earnings and household incomes have dropped. However, trends in the housing market have led to a jump in inequalities in wealth across the UK. With the government promising to ""level up"" the nation despite the Covid epidemic, what do the figures tell us? The rest of the UK did not suddenly out-strip London in terms of earnings. Instead, a higher minimum wage had a bigger impact outside the capital, and high earning jobs - many of which were based inside the M25 - were slow to recover after the last recession. Wages back above pre-economic crisis levels Minimum wage: How high could the lowest salaries go? It meant wages grew more slowly in London than elsewhere. After accounting for inflation, average full-time earnings in London have increased just 1.5% since 2002, compared with 5.6% across the UK. But there are still big gaps in both earnings and productivity. Life in the capital comes with a catch: much higher housing costs. Take them into account and poverty is at its highest in London. What distinguishes the least well-off areas - the IFS says - is not the rate of poverty, but the lack of high earning households. According to the IFS, median household income after housing costs have been deducted has risen by 13% since the early 2000s outside the capital, compared with only 6% growth in London over the same period. Pay in London may have grown more slowly, but it is still much higher than elsewhere. What makes you wealthy, compared to the people around you, varies massively. Want to count yourself in the top 10% of earners? You need to earn just under Â£50,000 in Wales, but more than Â£85,000 in London. If you have owned property in the capital for a while, you are also likely to have grown much wealthier, on paper at least. The average financial and property wealth of Londoners soared 150% in the decade to 2018, compared to just 3% for the North East of England. David Phillips, an associate director at IFS andan author of the report,external, says the rapid growth in house prices has ""widened wealth inequalities not just between London and the rest of the country, but also between those on and off the housing ladder in the capital"". Inequality is not all about economics though. If your child receives free school meals, what are his or her chances of going to university? Very different depending on where you live. Almost half of children receiving free school meals in inner London go on to higher education, compared to less than a fifth in several other English regions. The IFS report also says people in London benefit from better educational outcomes. In 2005, 33% of young people attending state schools in inner London entered higher education. Today, 55% of young people in this area attend university. In contrast, 37% of young people living in the South West now go to university, up from 29% in 2005. Stacey Neile, in Sefton, Merseyside, has just set up a sweet shop. She is building the business to pass on to her children, she says, because it is the only way she thinks they will escape a life on low pay. ""Everything round here is minimum wage,"" she told the BBC. A higher minimum wage has helped boost pay outside London, but to her it feels like the maximum her family might ever earn. On Friday,IFS released research,externalshowing young people were increasingly beginning their careers on the lowest rungs of the career ladder, despite rising education levels. Merseyside entrepreneur Dr Elliot Street co-founded healthcare firm Inovus from his bedroom in 2012. He discovered his star product designer working as a sales assistant in a local Maplin's electronics store. ""Now I almost expect to find them in Aldi, the car wash, who knows,"" he said. The IFS is concerned that the trends and challenges it has highlighted will further be impacted by the coronavirus crisis, although it doesn't know yet how bad such an impact might be. However, it also sees opportunities to address the inequalities that currently persist. For instance, the rise of remote working due to lockdown could ""reduce the pull of London and other major cities"", which means access to higher-paid jobs could increase for residents of other areas, which would help to narrow income and wealth gaps, as property prices adjust. A Treasury spokesman said that it remains ""absolutely committed to helping every part of the country return to growth, jobs and prosperity in a way that is safe"" . ""This means levelling-up communities who have felt left behind and truly delivering for every region and nation of the UK,"" he added. ""We recognise that every region and community will be feeling the impacts of coronavirus, and we've introduced unprecedented support for business and workers to protect them against the current economic crisis.""

"Bob Behnken (L) and Doug Hurley arrived in Florida on 20 May to prepare for launch Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by travelling to the International Space Station (ISS) and back aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members. On 30 May 2020, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken broke a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz. But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft. Key questions about the mission How we got to this point What is the Crew Dragon? Evolution of the spacesuit What's the mission plan? The Crew Dragon undergoes final processing prior to the Demo-2 launch ""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight. Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him."" This video can not be played Nasa's Dr Michael Barratt explains what qualities are required of today's astronauts. Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends. ""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley. When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too. Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel. Hurley and Nyberg take their son for a stroll in Red Square, just prior to Nyberg's 2013 flight Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas. ""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,""Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.,external Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six. Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport. Behnken in 2009, training for the STS-130 shuttle mission They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,""Behnken told CNN before the launch,external. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands."" Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two. The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009. Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010,he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"",external, adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person."" Hurley piloted the final flight of the shuttle era, in 2011 He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines. They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven. ""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table."" Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms. Behnken (L) and Hurley pose for pictures in front of the Crew Dragon Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay. When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as theprime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.,external ""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month. They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels. Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX. ""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained. Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley. Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship."" Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree. ""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""

"Elon Musk's SpaceX is flying people to and from the International Space Station (ISS), using the Crew Dragon vehicle. But why is Nasa paying a private company to launch its astronauts? To understand the background to the Crew Dragon missions, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident. On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster. The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme. On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon. Artwork: Nasa conceived of the Orion spacecraft as a replacement to the shuttle The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort. At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. ""SpaceX was founded to make life multi-planetary,"" says Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX. But, she adds: ""We were a very small company for several years. So we had to look for opportunities - how do you go from being a small company to actually putting people into orbit. When Nasa came out with the need to fly cargo to and from the International Space Station, we jumped on that."" The Dragon 1 spacecraft was designed to carry cargo to and from the space station SpaceX was shortlisted for evaluation under the Nasa cargo programme in 2006. But by 2008, SpaceX and Tesla, the electric car manufacturer in which Musk had invested, were running low on cash. Musk was faced with an impossible choice: ""I could either split the funds that I had between the two companies, or focus it on one company - with certain death for the other,""he told Business Insider in 2013.,external ""I decided in the end to split what I had and try to keep both companies alive. But that could have been a terrible decision that could have resulted in both companies dying."" Fortunately, on 23 December 2008, Nasa awarded SpaceX with a $1.6bn contract to ferry cargo and supplies to the ISS. Describing his reaction, Musk said: ""I couldn't even maintain my composure, I was like: 'I love you guys'."" The company's Dragon 1 capsule could carry cargo and supplies, but not humans. Nevertheless, it represented a milestone for the company. In November 2008, Barack Obama had been elected president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). SpaceX performed a successful flight to the space station without crew in 2019 However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan. Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed. From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014. Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases. Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the aim of taking humans to other planets Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn't always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event. The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth. These mishaps, along withearlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program,external, had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016. Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

Bridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak. The next day, Musk shot back with a dig at the agency's own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: ""Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?"" The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa's Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns. Musk's company wasn't alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing's spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year. This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon's launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic first lift-off with astronauts from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on 30 May. Nasa's Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken spent two months aboard the ISS before returning to Earth safely in the capsule. In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project. ""If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don't know that I would have believed it,"" said Bridenstine. ""Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed."" The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: ""Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn't even have got started without Nasa.""

"US tech giant Microsoft has confirmed that it is continuing talks to purchase the US operations of Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella had a conversation with President Donald Trump about the acquisition on Sunday, the tech firm said. Microsoft stressed that it ""fully appreciates the importance"" of addressing President Trump's concerns. A full security review of the app will be conducted, the company added. Microsoft will also have to provide the US government with a list of the ""proper economic benefits"" to the country, it said in ablog post,external. The tech giant hopes to conclude discussions with TikTok's parent firm ByteDance by 15 September. TikTok hits back after Trump threatens US ban How would the US go about banning TikTok? Should we be worried about TikTok? Microsoft said it was looking to purchase the TikTok service in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and would operate the app in these markets. The tech firm added that it ""may"" invite other American investors to participate in the purchase ""on a minority basis"". Microsoft emphasised that it would ensure that ""all private data of TikTok's American users"" was transferred to and remained in the US. Further, it would ensure that any data currently stored or backed up outside the country would be deleted from servers after it was transferred to US data centres. It also said that Microsoft ""appreciates the US Government's and President Trump's personal involvement as it continues to develop strong security protections for the country."" But the tech giant added that current discussions were still in the ""preliminary"" stage, and as such there was ""no assurance"" that the purchase would proceed. A possible sale of TikTok's US operations to Microsoft was thought to be on hold after Donald Trump vowed to ban the video-sharing app, according to aWall Street Journal report,external. The potential sale had been seen close to agreement but was put in doubt after the US president's warning on Friday. And on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that President Trumpwould take action ""in the coming days"" against Chinese-owned softwarethat he believed to pose a national security risk. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Pompeo said the action would be taken ""with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party"". Short-form video app TikTok is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide - and about 80 million in the US - with a huge proportion of these in their teens or early 20s. This video can not be played WATCH: Will TikTok be banned? Some US politicians are worried the app's Chinese owner ByteDance poses a risk to national security because it could be used to collect Americans' personal data. Regulators have also raised their own safety concerns. Late on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ""As far as TikTok is concerned we're banning them from the United States."" And in a statement on Saturday, a White House spokesman said: ""The administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy."" The Wall Street Journal said ByteDance tried to make significant concessions to the White House, including creating thousands of jobs over three years. A sale of the US operation to Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, would give the US tech giant a far greater presence in social media, an area dominated by rivals. The value of TikTok's US arm has been put at between $15bn and $30bn (Â£11bn-Â£23bn). According to the Financial Times,external, some executives at ByteDance believe Mr Trump's intervention may just be a negotiating ploy to help Microsoft secure a better deal. TikTok declined to discuss the possible Microsoft deal, but a spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday: ""While we do not comment on rumours or speculation, we are confident in the long-term success of TikTok."" The statement re-iterated that the company was committed to protecting the privacy and safety of users. The move to ban TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The president's announcement on Friday was criticised by some in the tech sector, including former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, who questioned whether the move was spurred by national security concerns. He tweeted: ""This is getting bizarre. A 100% sale to an American company would have been considered a radical solution two week ago and, eventually, mitigates any reasonable data protection concerns. If the White House kills this we know this isn't about national security."" Mr Trump was also criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Banning an app that millions of Americans use to communicate with each other is a danger to free expression and is technologically impractical,"" said the ACLU's surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, Jennifer Granick. ""Shutting one platform down, even if it were legally possible to do so, harms freedom of speech online and does nothing to resolve the broader problem of unjustified government surveillance,"" she said. On Saturday, in a bid to reassure TikTok's millions of US users,Vanessa Pappas, the country's general manager said in a video message: ""We're not going anywhereâ.â.â. We're here for the long run. ""When it comes to safety and security, we're building the safest app because we know it's the right thing to do. So we appreciate the support.""
