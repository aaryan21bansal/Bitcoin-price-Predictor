"This video can not be played A year into Taliban rule, the number of newborn deaths and miscarriages in one province, Badakhshan, have nearly doubled, local doctors say. Foreign funding which financed Afghanistanâs public healthcare was frozen in August last year. Our correspondent Yogita Limaye has spent time in maternity wards there, witnessing the unbearable suffering of women with no access to pain relief, forced to share beds, and an acute shortage of doctors. Amongst all of this, some babies are beating the odds, and surviving, but tragically many are not.

"The payments will be made to survivors 'as soon as possible' Payments of Â£100,000 will be made to victims of the contaminated blood scandal, the government is expected to announce this week. Boris Johnson wants payments, recommended by a public inquiry, to be made to more than 4,000 survivors ""as soon as possible"", said Downing Street. Thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s through NHS treatments. More than 2,400 people have died as a result. A No 10 source said: ""The infected blood scandal was a tragedy for everyone involved, and the prime minister strongly believes that all those who suffered so terribly as a result of this injustice should receive compensation as quickly as possible. ""He has tasked ministers with resolving this issue so that interim payments can be made to all those infected as soon as possible, and we will set out the full details later this week."" Infected blood victims set for Â£400m in compensation Ex-health secretaries call for urgent blood scandal pay-outs Major calls blood scandal 'incredibly bad luck' Victims and families get an annual financial support payment but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. The chairman of the infected blood public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, said last month individuals who currently qualify for financial support, including some bereaved partners of those killed, should now be offered interim compensation of Â£100,000 each. He said there was a case to make those interim payments to surviving victims quickly. The idea would be to fund bills and care needs, with final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people expected when the inquiry concludes next year. The inquiry has looked at how NHS patients with haemophilia and other blood disorders became seriously ill after being given a new treatment imported from the US. The medication, factor VIII or IX, was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors. If a donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated. An unknown number of UK patients were also exposed to hepatitis B or C though a blood transfusion after childbirth or hospital surgery. The government has introduced schemes offering victims financial support but, unlike in the Republic of Ireland and some other countries, compensation has never been paid to individuals or families affected.

"Zed says the local food pantry has been a ""massive help"" to feed her sons Holiday food vouchers for children on free school meals have been cut in value by councils across England this summer, BBC News research reveals. Out of 97 responses from local authorities, 43 said they had either stopped giving out vouchers or reduced the amount they were worth. Some councils blame government rule changes for the cutbacks. The government says funding is available to help councils support families in various ways. Families with children on free school meals across the UK have been offered food vouchers during school holidays, sincea successful campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashfordduring the pandemic. In England, about1.9 million childrenhave free school meals. The funding for this summer's food vouchers comes from the Â£421m Household Support Fund. Up to two-thirds can be spent on families with children and councils can decide how best to spend the cash in their area, to help those struggling financially. But at least a third must be spent on pensioners - a rule change several councils have told BBC News has contributed to the reduction in the value of holiday food vouchers. BBC News contacted all 152 local authorities in England. Of the 97 responses: 11 have scrapped food vouchers this year 32 have reduced the value compared with last summer The biggest drop was in Southampton, where families received a one-off payment of Â£30 per child this year, down from Â£90 in 2021 Oldham also saw a big drop, from a Â£90 one-off payment per child to Â£40 Seven local authorities have increased the value of their food vouchers Since the school term finished, Zed, from Yardley, in Birmingham, has been coming to her local food pantry, for discounted food for her sons, Jacob and Elijah. Jacob is on free school meals, so in the summer holidays last year, the family received Â£15 a week in food vouchers from the council - but this year, the vouchers have been scrapped. Zed says the pantry has been a ""massive help"" to fill the gap. ""Â£15 might not sound like a lot of money - but in the grand scheme, it is,"" she says. ""When you've got two children to be paying for, it is a big loss."" Children on free school meals in the area this year have instead been offered events on weekdays providing a free healthy meal through a scheme called Bring it on Brum, funded by the Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) programme, Birmingham City Council said. Families could also apply for hardship grants. Council-funded events such as this one in Birmingham provide meals for children in the holidays - but do not reach all those eligible for free school meals The HAF programme is a Â£200m government scheme to provide childcare, healthy meals and activities for children from low-income families during the holidays, which was rolled out across England last summer. Some 36 councils who responded to BBC News said they were expanding their HAF events this year, offering help not just to those on free school meals. Zed has taken her sons to one of the council-funded events, in her local park, but travelling to those further from home can be ""extremely difficult"". ""As much as I do try to get my children out, I am restricted sadly in terms of getting there,"" says Zed, who does not drive. ""Taxis are easier - but I don't have the money for that. ""Unfortunately it is a situation where I'd love to go but I can't always do it."" Food voucher U-turn after Rashford campaign Give more pupils free school meals, teachers say Holiday free school meal plan in Kent 'does not meet need' Single mum in tears as meal vouchers scaled back Official figures,externalshow 498,000 children on free school meals (29%) attended HAF events last summer. The Children's Society, which is campaigning for more children to be given free school meals, said it was ""deeply concerned"" many struggling parents would miss out on help this summer. Executive director for social impact Joe Jenkins said: ""Depending on which part of the country a child lives in, they get a completely different set of support put in place for them. ""What we really need is a standard across the country that means every young person has access to food all the way through the day - whether it's in summer holidays or during the school term."" A government official said food vouchers were not the only way councils could support families with children on free school meals. ""More widely, we are protecting eight million low-income families with at least Â£1,200 of direct payments, while additional support for disabled people and pensioners is also on the way,"" they added.

"A senior ally of Liz Truss says the Tory leadership candidate has not ruled out giving help to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. Penny Mordaunt claimed that to say so was ""overinterpreting"" what Ms Truss had previously said. The foreign secretary had said she would focus on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". Rishi Sunak, her leadership rival, said she was ""simply wrong"" to rule out more cost of living payments. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, trade minister Ms Mordaunt said Ms Truss had not ruled out expanding direct payments to help people struggling financially. The former Conservative leadership candidate said: ""There'll be different things required for different people - there's the package of support that's already been put in place [and] Liz is looking at other measures."" In an interview with the Financial Times this weekend, Ms Truss said she would ""look at what more can be done"", adding: ""The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts."" Ms Truss has also said she would seek to immediately reverse the rise in National Insurance contributions if elected. Her team, who initially thought the plan could not be implemented until April 2023, have said they now believe it would be within weeks. But Mr Sunak has said the tax proposals would not be a significant help for ""people like pensioners or those on low incomes who are exactly the kind of families that are going to need help"". Instead, the former chancellor said he would give more direct help to those hardest hit by inflation. Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are vying for support from Conservative party members to be elected the next party leader, and prime minister. Voting has started and the result is due to be announced on 5 September. What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Oliver Dowden, former Tory party co-chairman and a supporter of Mr Sunak, said the foreign secretary's approach was ""insufficient"". ""This isn't the way to help people through this very difficult period"", he said. Since April, workers have been paying more in National Insurance - an extra 1.25p in the pound - although Mr Sunak later raised the threshold at which employees start contributing. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMs Truss said she wanted to ""immediately tackle the cost of living crisis"", adding: ""I would hit the ground running by bringing in an emergency budget, charting a firm course to get our economy growing in order to help fund our public services and NHS."" But Mr Sunak, who has argued that inflation must be brought under control before taxes are lowered,told the Sunday Times,external: ""The priority for me is to not do things that make it worse."" He said the public needed ""clear-eyed realism and not starry-eyed boosterism"", and said his rival's plans would give back less than Â£200 a year to many families, and ""are not going to help very significantly"" pensioners and those on low incomes. Mr Sunak pledged to introduce a fresh multi-billion pound package of help. Both candidates agree that people will need more help with the cost of living this autumn, but fixing it with tax cuts alone will be tricky. Tax cuts will only bring relief to taxpayers. Cutting the health and social care levy doesn't put money in the pockets of pensioners or anyone earning less than Â£12,570 - as they don't pay it. Someone earning Â£24,100 a year would save Â£180, according to HMRC, while higher-paid workers would gain considerably more. So the help is poorly directed at those who will feel the pressure of rising bills most acutely. And with the public finances under growing pressure from a predicted recession, whoever is chancellor will have limited resources at their disposal. So they may decide that tax cuts alone aren't the most efficient way to provide help. The new prime minister won't start the job for another four weeks. Until then the candidates will come under increasing pressure to spell out their plans. It comes as former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown has saidan emergency budget was needednow. Writing in the Observer,,externalhe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ms Truss and Mr Sunak should agree on one this week, warning ""a financial timebomb will explode for families in October"" when the energy price cap next rises. A report commissioned by Mr Brown suggests some families are set to be Â£1,600 worse off per year. The additional money from the government offered to low income households falls short of offsetting the losses they face, the research led by Prof Donald Hirsch at Loughborough University says. ""It is the urgent task of the next prime minister to ensure that families have enough to live, through this crisis and beyond,"" Mr Brown said. A government spokesperson said they understood people were struggling with rising prices, which was why an extra Â£1,200 was being made available to eight million of the most vulnerable households. ""Through our Â£37bn support package we are also saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, allowing people on Universal Credit to keep Â£1,000 more of what they earn and cutting fuel duty by 5p, saving a typical family Â£100,"" they added.

"Vice-President Kamala Harris cast the deciding vote in a divided Senate The US Senate has approved a sweeping $700bn (Â£577bn) economic package that includes major legislation on healthcare, tax and climate change. The bill seeks to lower the cost of some medicines, increase corporate taxes and reduce carbon emissions. The passing of the bill - a flagship part of President Joe Biden's agenda - is a boost ahead of mid-term elections. But it is a significantly scaled-back version of the $3.5tn package that was first proposed by his administration. The bill, a product of 18 months of intense wrangling, passed by a margin of 51 to 50 on Sunday with Vice-President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote. It was previously blocked by two Democratic senators who shared Republican concerns about its cost. It will now be sent to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass in a vote on Friday before the president can sign it into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes legislation that would allow the government to negotiate lower prices for prescription medicines provided under its Medicare health insurance programme for those aged over 65. That is expected to save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, according to estimates from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The package also includes a minimum 15% tax on most corporations that make more than $1bn a year in profits. That measure, an issue of contention during negotiations in Congress, is opposed by business groups who argue it will limit investment. ANALYSIS:US climate win masks scale of warming challenge BACKGROUND:Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate? The bill also includes $369bn for climate action - the largest investment in the issue in US history. Some households could receive up to $7,500 in tax credits to buy an electric car, or $4,000 for a used car. Billions will also be spent in an effort to speed up the production of clean technology such as solar panels and wind turbines. There will also be $60bn given to communities that have suffered the most from fossil fuel pollution. The authors of the bill say it will cut the country's carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The action on climate comes as the US experiences a wave of extreme weather, including a recent heatwave as well as deadly flooding in Kentucky that left dozens dead. President Biden visited flood-damaged areas of the state on Monday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers were ""making history"" Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said: ""After more than a year of hard work, the Senate is making history. To Americans who've lost faith that Congress can do big things, this bill is for you."" Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, reportedly cried tears of joy as he left the chamber. ""Now I can look my kid in the eye and say we're really doing something about the climate,"" he said, according to the New York Times. Some Republicans have said they will try to stall or block the progress of the bill. Florida's Republican Senator Marco Rubio argued it was out of touch as it did not help to lower prices for working people or keep criminals in jail - ""the things working people in this country care about"". On Saturday, Congress debated a revised version of the bill, after compromises on the more ambitious original plan were agreed with two key Democratic holdouts, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Mr Manchin had feared the original bill would have exacerbated inflation. President Biden - who has called the bill ""historic"" - has pledged to return the US to the international stage on climate action. In April last year, he pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030. Last month, he announced $2.2bn to help build infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather and natural disasters. This isn't the all-singing, all-dancing climate mega-bill Joe Biden promised when he became president - but if it passes it will be the most ambitious action the US has taken to try to stop the planet overheating. And the indirect impact could be even more consequential. President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has been tireless in his efforts to persuade other countries to raise their ambitions on climate change. But the US faced a credibility gap. ""You can't preach temperance from a bar stool,"" is how one Democratic senator put it. What he means is you can't ask India, China or Brazil to cut emissions unless you are doing so yourself. That's still a very big ask, and things are particularly strained with China right now. Beijing said it is halting co-operation over climate change following senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi's recent trip to Taiwan. But with the US leading by example, the hope is that international efforts to tackle global warming will be revitalised.

"Lisa is contemplating dentures after her crown treatment left her with serious complications Hundreds of British dentists have treated patients with serious complications after they travelled abroad to get cut-price crowns, a BBC documentary has learned. The latest cosmetic look, seen on ITV's Love Island and via the hashtag #Turkeyteeth, has given some people their dream smile but left others asking the NHS to pick up the pieces. Lisa Martyn never expected she would contemplate getting dentures at the age of 48. But after travelling abroad for an invasive cosmetic dental procedure, she believes there are few other options. ""My teeth are gone. They're filed down so much,"" she says. ""They never said your teeth can die, that you can get an abscess."" Last year, Lisa flew to Turkey for 26 veneers, usually thin shells placed around teeth that are minimally shaved down, hoping to achieve a perfect smile for her son's wedding. Months later she discovered she had actually been given crowns. These involve 60% - 70% of the natural tooth being filed down to fangs or stubs, before a tooth cap is glued on top. Patients can choose the shape, material and colour of these caps, often opting for a bright, white, symmetrical smile. The trend of travelling to countries like Turkey for dental treatment has been dubbed ""Turkey teeth"". It is popular on social media, where a TikTok hashtag has reached more than 130 million views, and with several reality TV influencers. Turkey Teeth: Bargain Smiles or Big Mistake The BBC explores the TikTok trend in which young people are travelling to Turkey to get a brand new smile. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) But 10 months on, Lisa, from Ireland, has been plagued by ongoing nerve sensitivity and excruciating pain. She has lost more than two stone (12.7kg) as she is unable to eat properly and has spent months relying on painkillers. The pain culminated in an infection and abscess which Lisa says nearly paralysed half of her face. Her original procedure in Turkey cost her 3,500 euro (Â£3,000) but her private remedial treatment, which includes two rounds ofroot canal surgery,external, will cost her more than 2,000 euro. She has been told the only long-term treatment available is implants or dentures. ""Financially it's going to cripple me, but that's just the price I have to pay after going to Turkey and filing all my teeth down,"" she says. The BBC contacted Lisa's clinic in Turkey, but did not receive a response. We spoke to some UK dentists who say they'd be concerned their regulatory bodies would not allow them to conduct such work. Dr MJ Rowland-Warmann, director of a dental clinic in Liverpool, emphasised crowns can cause major complications. ""If I did 20 crowns on a 21-year-old for the purposes of improving the colour, I would have my licence revoked, I would be struck off,"" she says. An exclusive survey for BBC News of 1,000 dentists, by trade union the British Dental Association (BDA), found 597 respondents said they had treated both patients with crown complications and seen patients who visited Turkey for their dental treatment. Nearly one in five of those surveyed said the repair costs exceeded Â£5,000. Three-hundred-and-forty-six dentists said some of this remedial treatment was provided by the NHS. It is not known how many people from the UK have had such treatment abroad. Studies also suggest on average,a quarter of crowns have to be extracted after 15 years,external. Crowns also increase the risk of having root canal treatments, extractions and dentures in future. One of the first to sport the trend was ex-Love Island winner Jack Fincham, who travelled to Turkey for 10 crowns before entering the villa in 2018. ""My mum used to be a dental nurse, so I know how expensive it is to get your teeth done. I knew it would be about Â£10,000 - Â£15,000 easily in England. So I thought I'd rather just go to Turkey get a bit of sun, have a laugh."" Jack Fincham during and after treatment The week Jack appeared on the reality show and spoke about his teeth, Google searches for ""Turkey Teeth"" spiked. But he admits, ""I didn't really know what a crown was. And I didn't know it was quite as invasive as it was."" Not all patients return with complications. Tilly, 22, has had no regrets since travelling to Turkey for 16 crowns in January. ""Ever since a young age, I was bullied for my teeth,"" she explains. ""I was called things like Bugs Bunny and told how pretty I'd be if I didn't have the teeth I had."" She says the treatment has significantly changed her life. Tilly booked her treatment by messaging the clinic on Instagram ""I'm smiling a lot more, I'm laughing. I'm not hiding my mouth which I did constantly,"" she says. ""I'm just more and more myself, it's given me my confidence back."" Like many others travelling to Turkey for crown procedures, Tilly booked her treatment by messaging her clinic via Instagram. The clinic then asked her to send some photographs of her teeth, before providing her with a treatment plan. The BBC contacted 150 dental clinics in Turkey and 50 cosmetic dental clinics in the UK via Instagram with a picture of our documentary presenter's teeth with the following message: ""Hi, hoping to come to Turkey to get my teeth done for my 26th birthday. I'm not happy with my bottom teeth and want them more in line with the rest of my mouth. What do you recommend, how much would it cost in pounds and how long will it last? Here are some pictures of my mouth."" Seventy of the 120 Turkish clinics that responded offered treatment that involved shaving down the natural teeth, such as crowns or veneers. None of the 34 UK clinics that responded offered a treatment plan of veneers or crowns, although some did suggest less invasive treatments such as aligners or composite bonding. Eddie Crouch, chairman of the BDA, warns: ""Patients need to provide informed consent for any treatment they have and be wary of a hard sell, as the reality is rarely as simple as it appears on Instagram. Sadly, many UK dentists are now picking up the pieces when things go wrong. ""We strongly advise people considering this to check a dentist's qualifications and experience and whether they are insured if things go wrong.""

"Nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK are not accepting new adult patients for treatment under the health service, a BBC investigation has found. In a third of the UK's more than 200 council areas, we found no dentists taking on adult NHS patients. And eight in 10 NHS practices are not taking on children. The Department of Health said it had made an extra Â£50m available ""to help bust the Covid backlogs"" and that improving NHS access was a priority. Patients in pain amid struggle to find dental care Are cut-price reality TV teeth worth it? BBC News contacted nearly 7,000 NHS practices - believed to be almost all those offering general treatment to the public. The British Dental Association (BDA) called it ""the most comprehensive and granular assessment of patient access in the history of the service"". While NHS dental treatment is not free for most adults, it is subsidised. The BBC heard from people across the UK who could not afford private fees and said the subsidised rates were crucial to getting care. The lack of NHS appointments has led people to drive hundreds of miles in search of treatment, pull out their own teeth without anaesthesia, resort to making their own improvised dentures and restrict their long-term diets to little more than soup. Disappearing Dentists Some people are going to extraordinary measure to do DIY dentistry as they struggle to find affordable dental care. Are we witnessing the death of NHS dentistry? Watch now on BBC iPlayer The investigation also found: The problem was worst in thesouth-west of England,Yorkshire and the Humberand theNorth West, where 98% of practices were not accepting new adult NHS patients Access was best inLondon, where almost a quarter of practices were taking on new adult NHS patients One in 10 local authorities did not have any practices taking on under-16s for NHS treatment, despite children in full-time education being entitled to completely free care on the health service About 200 practices said they would take on a child under the NHS only if a parent signed up as a private patient Not only did we find that in many places routine dental care was difficult to access quickly, most practices did not even have waiting lists. For those that did, the majority told us the waiting time was a year or longer, or were unable to say how long people might have to wait. One practice inNorfolktold the BBC it had more than 1,700 people on its list, while another, inCornwall, warned that it would take five years to be taken on as a patient. The British Dental Association, which represents high-street NHS dentists in the UK, said NHS dentistry was at a ""tipping point"" after a decade of under-investment. Caroline Young, fromBlackpool, had crowns fitted to her damaged teeth by an NHS dentist, but when her practice stopped treating patients on the health service four years ago, she was unable to find a new one. Almost every week she goes through the dentists in the phonebook to ask whether they are taking on new patients. This video can not be played Watch: Caroline Young makes her own dentures ""I've even called dental practices as far as 20 miles away, in Preston. I've re-called all my local ones many times. I can't even get on a waiting list,"" she said. Ms Young's crowns gradually fell out and she has now resorted to improvised solutions involving a form of plastic, which she found on social media. ""It was supposed to be temporary, but my temporary became twice a week,"" said Ms Young. Dentists warn that these homemade dentures are not only a dangerous choking hazard, but also food traps that can lead to worse tooth decay and gum damage. ""There are times when I've tried to fit it, and it's not worked, and I'll sit in floods of tears because I can't go out,"" she says. ""It's demoralising. I shouldn't feel that this holds me back, but it does. If I could afford private dentistry, I'd be there tomorrow."" Read more here. Scotlandhad significantly better access to NHS dentistry for adults than the other UK nations, with 18% of practices taking on new health-service patients. Wales,EnglandandNorthern Irelandhad broadly similar rates of access, at 7%, 9% and 10% respectively. Among the areas where BBC News researchers could not find a single practice accepting new adult patients wereLancashire,Norfolk,DevonandLeeds. Your device may not support this visualisation Most of the UK's NHS dentists are independent businesses and are not employed by the health service directly. If they fail to fulfil their NHS contract, the money that they have been paid is taken back. NHS England said it had recently made changes to the dentistry contract and would ""support practices to improve access, including giving high-performing practices the opportunity to increase their activity and treat more patients"". It said discussions on further changes were ""still ongoing"". The Welsh government also said it was working on reforming the dental system to improve access and quality of dental care. Wales announced in July thatmost adults would be offered dental check-ups once a yearinstead of every six months. Meanwhile, the Scottish government said more than 95% of the population of Scotland were registered with an NHS dentist and it was ""in a position of relative strength in terms of workforce numbers and capacity"". All the devolved governments pointed out that the coronavirus pandemic had affected the availability of NHS dental care. Northern Ireland's Department of Health said it was ""inevitable that access levels are not as favourable today as they were before Covid"". ""Patients who are currently not registered with a health-service dentist, and wish to become registered may unfortunately have to contact multiple practices and consider travelling further than normal,"" it added. Access to NHS dentistry has been a problem ever since the health service was created. Free treatment ended in 1951, just three years after the NHS was formed, because it was deemed unaffordable. Ever since, a subsidised system - where some patients pay towards the cost - has been in place. Alongside this, a strong private market has developed. An estimated one in seven adults relies on it. It leaves dentists with a real choice about how much NHS work they do. Over recent years NHS access has been getting harder. The current NHS contract in England and Wales, which dates back to 2006, is unpopular with dentists, who feel unrewarded for the work they do. Austerity also squeezed budgets and then the pandemic hit, creating a backlog of patients with worsening oral health. This combination of factors appears to have prompted more dentists to walk away - the numbers doing NHS work dropped by 10% last year. It's fair to say the difficulties patients are facing are unprecedented. The dentists' union blamed the current NHS contract for the lack of accessible dental care. ""There doesn't appear to be a commitment, really, from the Treasury to actually invest in [dentistry],"" said BDA chairman Eddie Crouch. ""Patients are having teeth removed because it's a cheaper option than actually saving the teeth. The whole system is set up for health inequalities, and that significantly needs to change. ""Many of my colleagues do not see enough emphasis on improving the situation in the short term."" Save my tooth or heat my house - carer Dentistry cash 'a drop in the ocean', MP says Paul Woodhouse, dentist and BDA board member, told BBC Breakfast emergency appointments at his practice were filled within five minutes of being open. He said the government was only providing 50% of the funding the UK needed to care for every patient, meaning half of the population were being left without an NHS dentist. ""If you said that about GPs or cancer screening, there would be riots on the street,"" he said. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of health think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said NHS dentistry was ""on life-support"" in some areas of the country. But he added: ""I think it's premature to say we're witnessing the death of it. ""There doesn't seem to be any real appetite for the sort of big structural and investment decisions that are required to fix NHS dentistry."" BBC researchers aimed to contact every dental practice with an NHS contract in the four nations to ask whether they were taking on new patients. Using lists from NHS organisations, we identified 8,523 dental practices across the UK that were believed to hold NHS contracts and tried to call them all during May, June and July. We then narrowed down this list, excluding practices that were not contactable by telephone or were permanently closed were not available to the public for general and routine dental treatment, including hospitals weren't an NHS practice We were left with a list of 6,880 practices. For our analysis, we looked at the distribution of the practices across the UK's 217 upper-tier local authorities. We classified a practice as accepting new child NHS patients if they would take on those under the age of 16. A practice that required a referral to take on a patient was not treated as accepting new NHS patients, since a referral requires an initial appointment with a dentist, which is a barrier to entry.

"The Benin plaque of Chief Uwangue and Portuguese traders is one of the objects being returned to Nigeria A London museum says it has agreed to return to Nigeria artefacts looted in the 19th Century from the Kingdom of Benin. The Horniman Museum said ownership of 72 objects would be transferred to the Nigerian government.

"Gordon Brown calls on the government to provide an emergency budget to mitigate the UK's ""financial timebomb"" Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has called for an emergency budget before the UK hits a ""financial timebomb"" this autumn. Mr Brown said millions would be pushed ""over the edge"" if the government does not address the cost of living crisis. Conservative leadership rivals Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have clashed over how they will address high inflation. He wants them to agree an emergency budget with PM Boris Johnson this week, or for Parliament to be recalled. Writing in the Observer,external, Mr Brown said: ""The reality is grim and undeniable: a financial timebomb will explode for families in October as a second round of fuel price rises in six months sends shock waves through every household and pushes millions over the edge."" A new report commissioned by Mr Brown, carried out by Professor Donald Hirsch from Loughborough University, found that 35 million people in 13 million households across the UK are under threat of fuel poverty in October. This is ""an unprecedented 49.6% of the population of the United Kingdom"", said Mr Brown. Findings from thereport,externalsuggest the additional one-off Â£1,200 support for low-income households will fail to compensate for three major blows to income from October 2021 to October 2022. The loss of the Â£20-a-week benefits uplift, the rise in the energy price cap and an annual uprating out of line with inflation forecasts all mean the worst-off families will find it hard to bridge the gap. Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's World at One that action is needed promptly to ensure the benefits system - and the computers that operate it - are able to get help to people before October. He said there is a vacuum at the centre of government, with both Mr Johnson and Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi on holiday. ""Not enough thinking is being done about the major social crisis,"" he added. If elected as the next Tory leader, Ms Truss has promised to reverse some of former Chancellor Mr Sunak's tax rises, including the rise in National Insurance contributions. Meanwhile, Mr Sunak said theTories can ""kiss goodbye"" to winning the next electionsif inflation is not under brought under control quickly. The Bank of England has warned inflation - currently 9.4% - could peak at more than 13% and stay at ""very elevated levels"" throughout much of next year, before eventually returning to its 2% target in 2024.

"More than 80,000 tourists have been left stranded in a popular resort in China after a coronavirus outbreak sparked a lockdown. Authorities cancelled all flights and trains from Sanya, known as ""China's Hawaii"", on Saturday, a day after 263 positive cases were confirmed. Travellers must now present five negative PCR tests over seven days before being allowed to leave. China is the only major economy to still follow a ""zero Covid"" policy. The country has recorded fewer than 15,000 deaths since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University. However, there have been concerns about the impact of the strict rules, including mass testing and local lockdowns, on the economy. China economy shrinks on zero-Covid policy Covid origin studies say evidence points to market The restrictions on Sanya, a city on the southern Hainan Island and a popular surfing destination, come during the peak tourist season. Essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies remain open, but entertainment venues have been closed since last week, AFP news agency reports. Authorities have said they will ask hotels to offer a 50 per cent discount until restrictions are lifted. Sanya is not the only city to have gone into lockdown in recent months. Around a million people in a suburb of Wuhan, the city in central China where Covid-19 was first recorded,faced fresh curbslast month after four asymptomatic cases were confirmed.

"One professor believes carbon capture and storage is the answer, but an economist suggested the technology would not be a viable solution. The UK's largest steelworks is facing ""crunch time"" over reducing carbon emissions, a professor has warned. There have been warnings the Port Talbot plant could be closedif a deal isn't reached for subsidies to reduce carbon emissions. Tata Steel said it was committed to cutting its impact on the environment and climate change. Prof John Gibbins said the technology could cost up to Â£1bn and take years to implement, but would save jobs. He told BBC Wales carbon capture and storage was the answer. But an economist said the technology would not be viable. So, what are the issues when it comes to making steel greener? Talks continuing with Tata steel, Welsh secretary says Port Talbot 'would be 'dead' without its steelworks Prof Gibbins, Director of the Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre, said carbon capture and storage would allow the plant to make low or zero-carbon steel beyond 2050. Carbon Capture and Storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide before it's released into the atmosphere, and then transporting and storing the carbon. He said the technology would take two to three years to implement, and cost between Â£500m and Â£1bn. He said: ""This is something that will preserve jobs, real jobs. What needs to be done, is for the Welsh government first of all to latch onto the idea. ""This is crunch time, if that plant gets closed then God help us."" Thousands of jobs in Wales are linked to Port Talbot's steelworks But Cardiff University Business School economics professor, Calvin Jones, said carbon capture would not work at Port Talbot and would add ""significantly"" to steelmaking costs. He said: ""Unfortunately, carbon capture and storage has not been proved at commercial scale - for fossil energy generation or industry. ""In the case of Port Talbot, there is simply nowhere near to store the carbon. Newly leased UK storage sites are all in the North Sea. ""This will require either an entirely new CO2 pipe-distribution network, or a fleet of CO2 carrier ships to take Port Talbot's CO2 to where it can be geologically stored. ""Either will add very significantly to steelmaking costs."" He did not believe carbon capture would be able to fix the climate problem for energy, industry or Port Talbot. Despite disagreeing on how to solve the problem, both scientists agree Port Talbot's Carbon emissions need to be addressed Prof Jones said there were alternatives. He said: ""There is some steel-making under development using hydrogen instead of coke. For example Volvo are procuring this for their cars. ""This of course requires a surplus of hydrogen, which can only be made in a zero carbon way with green electricity. ""Unfortunately, Wales has been slow to develop green electricity. South Wales has one of the highest carbon electricity supplies in the UK. ""So again, there would need to be, probably, billions in investment in and around the area to make this a reality for Tata. ""We have a lot of catching up to do."" This video can not be played What do people in Port Talbot think about the possible closure of the steelworks? Tata Steel said it was committed to cutting its impact on the environment and climate change. The firm said its ambition was to produce net-zero steel by or before 2050, and to have reduce 30% of CO2 emissions by 2030. A spokesman said: ""The company continues to make progressive strides in reducing the environmental impact of its processes through innovation, investment and collaboration. ""Additionally, its steel products remain critical not only for UK manufacturing supply chains, but also in the UK's transition to a green economy."" Tata Steel knows it has to dramatically reduce the amount of CO2 it emits to reach its own targets as part of the UK's transition to net zero. But, because the Port Talbot steelworks is vast and complex, radically changing the way it makes steel doesn't just take millions of pounds, it also takes years. That is exactly why the steelworks' owners want to know whether the UK government favours an economy based on renewable energy or hydrogen. It needs an answer quickly because transferring to an electric powered furnace or building a system to capture and store the carbon it emits would take years. The steel industry also sees itself as fundamental to building a new economy in Wales and the United Kingdom: whether that is building more nuclear power stations , wind farms or or transport infrastructure.

"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

"Zed says the local food pantry has been a ""massive help"" to feed her sons Holiday food vouchers for children on free school meals have been cut in value by councils across England this summer, BBC News research reveals. Out of 97 responses from local authorities, 43 said they had either stopped giving out vouchers or reduced the amount they were worth. Some councils blame government rule changes for the cutbacks. The government says funding is available to help councils support families in various ways. Families with children on free school meals across the UK have been offered food vouchers during school holidays, sincea successful campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashfordduring the pandemic. In England, about1.9 million childrenhave free school meals. The funding for this summer's food vouchers comes from the Â£421m Household Support Fund. Up to two-thirds can be spent on families with children and councils can decide how best to spend the cash in their area, to help those struggling financially. But at least a third must be spent on pensioners - a rule change several councils have told BBC News has contributed to the reduction in the value of holiday food vouchers. BBC News contacted all 152 local authorities in England. Of the 97 responses: 11 have scrapped food vouchers this year 32 have reduced the value compared with last summer The biggest drop was in Southampton, where families received a one-off payment of Â£30 per child this year, down from Â£90 in 2021 Oldham also saw a big drop, from a Â£90 one-off payment per child to Â£40 Seven local authorities have increased the value of their food vouchers Since the school term finished, Zed, from Yardley, in Birmingham, has been coming to her local food pantry, for discounted food for her sons, Jacob and Elijah. Jacob is on free school meals, so in the summer holidays last year, the family received Â£15 a week in food vouchers from the council - but this year, the vouchers have been scrapped. Zed says the pantry has been a ""massive help"" to fill the gap. ""Â£15 might not sound like a lot of money - but in the grand scheme, it is,"" she says. ""When you've got two children to be paying for, it is a big loss."" Children on free school meals in the area this year have instead been offered events on weekdays providing a free healthy meal through a scheme called Bring it on Brum, funded by the Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) programme, Birmingham City Council said. Families could also apply for hardship grants. Council-funded events such as this one in Birmingham provide meals for children in the holidays - but do not reach all those eligible for free school meals The HAF programme is a Â£200m government scheme to provide childcare, healthy meals and activities for children from low-income families during the holidays, which was rolled out across England last summer. Some 36 councils who responded to BBC News said they were expanding their HAF events this year, offering help not just to those on free school meals. Zed has taken her sons to one of the council-funded events, in her local park, but travelling to those further from home can be ""extremely difficult"". ""As much as I do try to get my children out, I am restricted sadly in terms of getting there,"" says Zed, who does not drive. ""Taxis are easier - but I don't have the money for that. ""Unfortunately it is a situation where I'd love to go but I can't always do it.""

"Peter Shilton, now aged 72, had a playing career spanning three decades As England's most-capped player, goalkeeper Peter Shilton had the world at his feet. Off the pitch, he was in the grip of a gambling addiction his entire adult life - until his wife became his recovery. In her own words, Steph Shilton describes life with a gambling addict, and how she is determined to help others like her. It was soon after we got together, in 2012, that I noticed his suspicious behaviour. He would go out of the room to use his phone; he was quite secretive. I thought there was another woman. If you live with a gambling addict you feel there is a third party involved in your relationship. On his phone, I saw the same number, over and over again. It was for a betting company. I thought he was being a gentleman and not gambling in front of me, and that it was just a little hobby. One night, I woke up and he wasn't in bed. He was on his laptop and on the screen was a tote [betting form]. It was the middle of the night and he was looking at betting on a horse race in Australia. Of course, he could gamble on any race, all over the world, at any time. Steph said she thought there was a ""third party"" in her relationship with Peter Shilton, due to his secretive behaviour That's when it hit me that it's not a hobby, that something was very wrong. I knew he had an addiction. I tried to talk to him. I'd worked a long time in the NHS and I had seen addicts and people going through withdrawal. I knew not to put pressure on him. He was very defensive; he was in denial. He said it was just something he did to unwind. It was always horse-racing, for him. It was a buzz for him. He knew managers and players who owned horses, it was part of the culture. People have this assumption that gambling addicts are down-and-outs; it's often highly astute, very intelligent, very professional people. You can't spot a gambler, and that makes it extremely difficult to get through to them. They hide it. I was finding it difficult as a loved one, living with that. He had been a gambler all his adult life, since the age of 15, so for 45 years. Peter Shilton, pictured aged 15, when he was part of the English School's Football Association team He proposed to me and wanted to take me to Barbados and get married. I would say to him, 'you are a gambler, I can't marry you. I am too worried that you are too trapped in it.' But I never gave him an ultimatum. I kept my finances separate. That's a piece of advice I tell loved ones [of gambling addicts] - keep your financial independence, and never lend money. I noticed that whenever he got his bank statement he would rip it up and burn it. Then his bank statement arrived in the post while he was working away. I wanted to see how much he was gambling. I opened it and there were pages and pages of his money going to the gambling company BetFair- Â£18,000 in a month. It was gobsmacking. I was shocked to the core. I thought 'oh my god, he is so ill'. It broke my heart. He was absolutely livid with me. I said 'you have got an illness; you have an addiction and you need help, and I am here to help you'. Then, I had a miscarriage. He was amazing. He didn't gamble, he nursed me and I did think 'he's going to give this up for me'. Peter Shilton had maintained a career in international football while in the grip of a decades-long gambling addiction He went back into it but I think he changed, we had lost a baby which we would have wanted and I think the loss made him worry that he was going to lose me. I think he was beginning to realise he had a serious problem, that he wasn't going to get the wedding or the trips to Barbados. Rather than rant and rave and stomp my feet, I worked at it very gradually. I was really scared for his wellbeing. He was going down, he was so deep in it, and he looked awful. In our relationship, we would normally have such fun but he was getting withdrawn. He faced off against some of the greatest players in the history of football, including Diego Maradona of Argentina One Sunday he had disappeared upstairs. I could hear him on the phone, trying to get some money for a job he had done. I said, 'I am going to move in the spare bedroom, I need to clear my head.' In the morning he looked horrendous, He hadn't slept. He said to me 'I know I've got a problem, I'm going to quit, but I'm going to need you do it with me'. We threw our arms around each other. It was one of the best moments of my life. I gave up my job to help him. He went through full-blown withdrawal. The first week he still doesn't remember. He couldn't sleep; he had to start a new life. With the England team ahead of the semi-final with West Germany in the 1990 World Cup It was a daily battle trying to keep him focused on something different, to keep him calm. He was yearning for a bet. In three months it started to subside. He got into golf. We went for beach walks. We got through it on our own, together. I had contacted Betfair and asked them to help, and they didn't do anything at all, not even put limits on his account. All the time I was trying to deal with my own emotions. It is so lonely. When his dad died, I worried that it would push him back. I did have to work through my worries and anxieties and trust issues. Five years after he quit, we started hearing about youngsters who were taking their own lives over gambling. I told Peter he had to do something; his voice would be huge. He was very emotional and said, 'That's it, I've got to try and save lives'. Peter and Steph at an awards ceremony in 2018, when he had recovered from his addiction but was yet to tell the world It took a lot of guts. We did an interview [in January 2020] to raise awareness and the next morning we had messages from addicts and loved ones. I was in tears. There were addicts who, because of Peter, were going to get help. Pete loves it, and obviously still works to raise awareness. But I realised nothing was being done for loved ones - the loved ones are just as much the victims as the addicts and it's being ignored. I was his recovery. I did a diploma to become a therapist and spoke toARA (Addiction Recovery Agency),external, who had some jobs coming up. I've been with them since April, as an ambassador and counsellor, working on theirsix to 10 project,external. It puts family and friends at the centre of care; six to 10 being the number of people affected by one person gambling. It's exactly what's needed - not just the emotional side of it but the financial issues. There are people who are angry, parents who want to tell off their kids for getting addicted and you have to explain, it's not their fault, this is an illness. It's no different to drugs. More support is needed through the recovery to give them the best chance to carry on through and not go back. To anyone worried about their loved one I'd say if you've got that gut feeling, go with it. If you've got that suspicion, ask. You've got to be strong to come through it all, but there is help. When we look back now, we think, 'we are amazing, did we really go through all that?'  It's an accomplishment for both of us. He said this is the happiest he has ever been in his personal life, and when he recovered I could see the peace of mind he had. He looked 10 years younger and was enjoying life. That was seven-and-a-half years ago. I think it's ironic that he was one of the greatest goalkeepers in the world and it was me, a little Essex girl, who managed to save a part of him. Betfair said it had changed its policies since Shilton's recovery, and in such circumstances now would suspend an account and impose an exclusion order if there were concerns a customer was not in control of their gambling.

"Flowers were laid outside Liquid Leisure Windsor on Sunday morning An 11-year-old girl has died after going missing at a water sports and activity park. Police were called to the lake at Liquid Leisure Windsor in Datchet, Berkshire, about 15.55 BST on Saturday after the child got into difficulty. She was found more than an hour later by emergency services and was rushed to hospital, but later died. Members of the public who went into the water to look for her have been praised for their bravery. Thames Valley Police said her death is being treated as unexplained and an investigation has been launched. The water park, in Datchet, Berkshire, has an obstacle course Supt Michael Greenwood said: ""This has been an extremely traumatic and upsetting incident for all involved."" Several members of the public got into the lake shortly after she got into difficulty ""but were unable to locate her"", he said. ""I would like to commend them for their courage and bravery,"" he added. People leaving flowers outside Liquid Leisure on Sunday afternoon A mother-of-two, who did not want to be named, was at the water park when the girl went missing. She said lifeguards and friends of the girl's family ran along the lake shouting her name at about 15:45. ""I later learnt that they were hoping she'd somehow managed to make it back to the shoreline and was in shock or passed out,"" the woman said. ""They were asking all of us to shout her name, describing her as shoulder height on an adult, with shoulder-length brown hair."" She said between 30 and 40 people - lifeguards and other swimmers - jumped into the water to look for the girl before emergency services arrived. ""As the situation unfolded, with every minute that passed by you could see the rising panic amongst the onlookers,"" the woman added. The Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service and South Central Ambulance Service joined police officers at the site. The National Police Air Service was also involved in the search, although it is not clear exactly where the girl was found. The girl's family have been informed and they are being supported by officers. The water park is closed on Sunday following the girl's death Supt Greenwood, the local policing area commander for Windsor and Maidenhead, offered his ""sincere condolences"" and requested that the privacy of the girl's family be ""respected"". He said: ""We are in the early stages of investigating this incident to understand the full circumstances."" Liquid Leisure Windsor describes itself as home to ""Europe's largest aqua park"", with a floating obstacle course on the lake. It also has outdoor activities including wakeboarding, open water swimming and boat rides. In a statement on its Facebook page, the company said it would be closed on Sunday. It said its thoughts were with all those affected ""by this desperately tragic and upsetting incident"". Liquid Leisure Windsor added it would not be right to comment further while police are in the early stages of an investigation, but it would ""continue to fully support and assist them throughout the process"".

I noticed that whenever he got his bank statement he would rip it up and burn it. Then his bank statement arrived in the post while he was working away. I wanted to see how much he was gambling. I opened it and there were pages and pages of his money going to the gambling company BetFair- Â£18,000 in a month. It was gobsmacking. I was shocked to the core. I thought 'oh my god, he is so ill'. It broke my heart. He was absolutely livid with me. I said 'you have got an illness; you have an addiction and you need help, and I am here to help you'. Then, I had a miscarriage. He was amazing. He didn't gamble, he nursed me and I did think 'he's going to give this up for me'. Peter Shilton had maintained a career in international football while in the grip of a decades-long gambling addiction He went back into it but I think he changed, we had lost a baby which we would have wanted and I think the loss made him worry that he was going to lose me. I think he was beginning to realise he had a serious problem, that he wasn't going to get the wedding or the trips to Barbados. Rather than rant and rave and stomp my feet, I worked at it very gradually. I was really scared for his wellbeing. He was going down, he was so deep in it, and he looked awful. In our relationship, we would normally have such fun but he was getting withdrawn. He faced off against some of the greatest players in the history of football, including Diego Maradona of Argentina One Sunday he had disappeared upstairs. I could hear him on the phone, trying to get some money for a job he had done. I said, 'I am going to move in the spare bedroom, I need to clear my head.' In the morning he looked horrendous, He hadn't slept. He said to me 'I know I've got a problem, I'm going to quit, but I'm going to need you do it with me'. We threw our arms around each other. It was one of the best moments of my life. I gave up my job to help him. He went through full-blown withdrawal. The first week he still doesn't remember. He couldn't sleep; he had to start a new life. With the England team ahead of the semi-final with West Germany in the 1990 World Cup It was a daily battle trying to keep him focused on something different, to keep him calm. He was yearning for a bet. In three months it started to subside. He got into golf. We went for beach walks. We got through it on our own, together. I had contacted Betfair and asked them to help, and they didn't do anything at all, not even put limits on his account. All the time I was trying to deal with my own emotions. It is so lonely. When his dad died, I worried that it would push him back. I did have to work through my worries and anxieties and trust issues. Five years after he quit, we started hearing about youngsters who were taking their own lives over gambling. I told Peter he had to do something; his voice would be huge. He was very emotional and said, 'That's it, I've got to try and save lives'. Peter and Steph at an awards ceremony in 2018, when he had recovered from his addiction but was yet to tell the world It took a lot of guts. We did an interview [in January 2020] to raise awareness and the next morning we had messages from addicts and loved ones. I was in tears. There were addicts who, because of Peter, were going to get help. Pete loves it, and obviously still works to raise awareness. But I realised nothing was being done for loved ones - the loved ones are just as much the victims as the addicts and it's being ignored. I was his recovery. I did a diploma to become a therapist and spoke toARA (Addiction Recovery Agency),external, who had some jobs coming up. I've been with them since April, as an ambassador and counsellor, working on theirsix to 10 project,external. It puts family and friends at the centre of care; six to 10 being the number of people affected by one person gambling. It's exactly what's needed - not just the emotional side of it but the financial issues. There are people who are angry, parents who want to tell off their kids for getting addicted and you have to explain, it's not their fault, this is an illness. It's no different to drugs. More support is needed through the recovery to give them the best chance to carry on through and not go back. To anyone worried about their loved one I'd say if you've got that gut feeling, go with it. If you've got that suspicion, ask. You've got to be strong to come through it all, but there is help. When we look back now, we think, 'we are amazing, did we really go through all that?'  It's an accomplishment for both of us. He said this is the happiest he has ever been in his personal life, and when he recovered I could see the peace of mind he had. He looked 10 years younger and was enjoying life. That was seven-and-a-half years ago. I think it's ironic that he was one of the greatest goalkeepers in the world and it was me, a little Essex girl, who managed to save a part of him. Betfair said it had changed its policies since Shilton's recovery, and in such circumstances now would suspend an account and impose an exclusion order if there were concerns a customer was not in control of their gambling.

"This video can not be played Watch: 'Incredible' Moraa wins gold in women's 800m final for Kenya 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. Kenya's Mary Moraa gatecrashed Keely Hodgkinson and Laura Muir's Anglo-Scottish duel to take 800m gold at the Commonwealth Games. The 22-year-old world bronze medallist showed devastating speed down the home straight to outlast Hodgkinson, winning in one minute 57.07 seconds. Scotland's Muir took bronze by one hundredth of a second ahead of Jamaica's Natoya Goule. Muir will have another shot at glory in Sunday's 1500m final. Hodgkinson however said she was ""fuming"" to have missed her chance to claim a first international title in front of a home crowd. ""I am not quite sure what happened, it went so quick,"" the world and Olympic silver medallist told BBC Sport. ""The first lap I went a bit hard, maybe I could have been a bit more patient. ""There are positives but I want gold so I am fuming. I wanted to stand on top of that podium in front of my home crowd. ""Unfortunately I came away with a silver, again. But I have got one more chance."" Hodgkinson, like Muir, is part of a large British team travelling to Munich for the European Championships next week. Hodgkinson was first to congratulate Muir after the latter endured a nervous wait to find out she had pipped Jamaica's Goule to bronze They, like the winner, will doubtless review this action-packed race before they arrive in Germany. Moraa initially appeared to have misjudged her pace, cantering clear of the pack in the opening 300 metres, before slowing around the bell. But there was still plenty of sting left in her legs and, as Hodgkinson and Muir attempted to crank up the pressure 200 metres from home, Moraa tracked them and found a gear beyond either. As Hodgkinson and Muir flopped to the track after the line, Moraa gleefully broke out a celebratory jig for the television cameras. Other than American Olympic and world champion Athing Mu, Moraa is the only athlete to have beaten Hodgkinson over 800m this year. She triumphed in Stockholm in June with a similarly ferocious kick from home and the former 400m specialist, who only changed up to two laps last year, looks set to make Mu and Hodgkinson's rivalry into a three-hander drama. ""Oh my goodness, these girls are fast,"" Muir told BBC Sport after finishing in 1:57.87, 0.47 seconds behind Hodgkinson. ""I was in fourth with 100 metres to go and I was just like 'no way'. ""Kids, that's why if your coach says run all the way to the line, you run all the way to the line."" Chalmers has won the British title in each of the past three years Three-time British champion Alastair Chalmers claimed Guernsey's first Commonwealth medal ever outside shooting and lawn bowls with a superb bronze in the 400m hurdles. The 22-year-old, running in lane two, followed home British Virgin Islands' Kyron McMaster, who successfully defended his title, and Jamaica's Jaheel Hyde in 49.97 seconds. ""You are absolutely amazing, all of you,"" Chalmers told the crowd after they had roared him home over the final 100 metres. Uganda's Jacob Kiplimo surged past Kenyan rivals Nicholas Kimeli and Jacob Krop to seize 5,000m gold and complete a distance double following his 10,000m triumph four days before. England's Marc Scott finished fourth in a season's best 13:19.84, but was more than 10 seconds off the leading trio. In the first track final of the evening, Jamaica's Janieve Russell kept her composure to defend her 400m hurdles title as compatriot Rushell Clayton went out fast and faded even faster.

"A senior ally of Liz Truss says the Tory leadership candidate has not ruled out giving help to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. Penny Mordaunt claimed that to say so was ""overinterpreting"" what Ms Truss had previously said. The foreign secretary had said she would focus on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". Rishi Sunak, her leadership rival, said she was ""simply wrong"" to rule out more cost of living payments. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, trade minister Ms Mordaunt said Ms Truss had not ruled out expanding direct payments to help people struggling financially. The former Conservative leadership candidate said: ""There'll be different things required for different people - there's the package of support that's already been put in place [and] Liz is looking at other measures."" In an interview with the Financial Times this weekend, Ms Truss said she would ""look at what more can be done"", adding: ""The way I would do things is in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts."" Ms Truss has also said she would seek to immediately reverse the rise in National Insurance contributions if elected. Her team, who initially thought the plan could not be implemented until April 2023, have said they now believe it would be within weeks. But Mr Sunak has said the tax proposals would not be a significant help for ""people like pensioners or those on low incomes who are exactly the kind of families that are going to need help"". Instead, the former chancellor said he would give more direct help to those hardest hit by inflation. Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are vying for support from Conservative party members to be elected the next party leader, and prime minister. Voting has started and the result is due to be announced on 5 September. What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? What taxes would Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak cut? Oliver Dowden, former Tory party co-chairman and a supporter of Mr Sunak, said the foreign secretary's approach was ""insufficient"". ""This isn't the way to help people through this very difficult period"", he said. Since April, workers have been paying more in National Insurance - an extra 1.25p in the pound - although Mr Sunak later raised the threshold at which employees start contributing. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalMs Truss said she wanted to ""immediately tackle the cost of living crisis"", adding: ""I would hit the ground running by bringing in an emergency budget, charting a firm course to get our economy growing in order to help fund our public services and NHS."" But Mr Sunak, who has argued that inflation must be brought under control before taxes are lowered,told the Sunday Times,external: ""The priority for me is to not do things that make it worse."" He said the public needed ""clear-eyed realism and not starry-eyed boosterism"", and said his rival's plans would give back less than Â£200 a year to many families, and ""are not going to help very significantly"" pensioners and those on low incomes. Mr Sunak pledged to introduce a fresh multi-billion pound package of help. Both candidates agree that people will need more help with the cost of living this autumn, but fixing it with tax cuts alone will be tricky. Tax cuts will only bring relief to taxpayers. Cutting the health and social care levy doesn't put money in the pockets of pensioners or anyone earning less than Â£12,570 - as they don't pay it. Someone earning Â£24,100 a year would save Â£180, according to HMRC, while higher-paid workers would gain considerably more. So the help is poorly directed at those who will feel the pressure of rising bills most acutely. And with the public finances under growing pressure from a predicted recession, whoever is chancellor will have limited resources at their disposal. So they may decide that tax cuts alone aren't the most efficient way to provide help. The new prime minister won't start the job for another four weeks. Until then the candidates will come under increasing pressure to spell out their plans. It comes as former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown has saidan emergency budget was needednow. Writing in the Observer,,externalhe said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ms Truss and Mr Sunak should agree on one this week, warning ""a financial timebomb will explode for families in October"" when the energy price cap next rises. A report commissioned by Mr Brown suggests some families are set to be Â£1,600 worse off per year. The additional money from the government offered to low income households falls short of offsetting the losses they face, the research led by Prof Donald Hirsch at Loughborough University says. ""It is the urgent task of the next prime minister to ensure that families have enough to live, through this crisis and beyond,"" Mr Brown said. A government spokesperson said they understood people were struggling with rising prices, which was why an extra Â£1,200 was being made available to eight million of the most vulnerable households. ""Through our Â£37bn support package we are also saving the typical employee over Â£330 a year through a tax cut in July, allowing people on Universal Credit to keep Â£1,000 more of what they earn and cutting fuel duty by 5p, saving a typical family Â£100,"" they added.
