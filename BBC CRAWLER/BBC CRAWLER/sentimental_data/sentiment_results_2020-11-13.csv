"The son of Sutcliffe's first victim, Wilma McCann, had appealed for an apology A police force has apologised for the ""language, tone and terminology"" used in the 1970s to describe some of the Yorkshire Ripper's victims. Senior West Yorkshire officers said some of the 13 women killed by Peter Sutcliffe,who has died aged 74, were ""innocent"" but implied others were not. The son of his first victim Wilma McCann had appealed for an apology. Force Chief Constable John Robins said the language used at the time was ""as wrong then as it is now"". This video can not be played Speaking before an apology from police, Richard McCann, the son of Peter Sutcliffe's first victim, Wilma McCann, reacts to his death Speaking earlier, Richard McCann, who was five when his mother was killed, said: ""They described some of the women as 'innocent', inferring that some were not innocent - including my mum. ""She was a family woman who, through no fault of her own, was going through adversity and made some bad decisions, some risky decisions."" ""She paid for those decisions with her life."" Twelve of the 13 women Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering: (Top row) Wilma McCann, Emily Jackson, Irene Richardson, Patricia Atkinson, Jayne McDonald and Jean Jordan.(Bottom row) Yvonne Pearson, Helen Rytka, Vera Millward, Josephine Whitaker, Barbara Leach and Jacqueline Hill Mr Robins said: ""On behalf of West Yorkshire Police, I apologise for the additional distress and anxiety caused to all relatives by the language, tone and terminology used by senior officers at the time in relation to Peter Sutcliffe's victims. ""Such language and attitudes may have reflected wider societal attitudes of the day, but it was as wrong then as it is now."" Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe dies Killer's 'culture of fear' Reporter recalls hunt for Ripper Public 'should focus on victims' Growing up in the shadow of the Yorkshire Ripper He added that the force's approach to investigations was now ""wholly victim-focused"". After the force published its apology, Mr McCann tweeted: ""Now that's worth celebrating. Thank You."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Detectives, journalists and the attorney general who prosecuted Sutcliffe have been criticised for dismissing some women who died as sex workers. Senior officers' focus on the killer targeting only sex workers was seen as one of the many crucial wrong turns taken during the 1970s investigation. At Sutcliffe's trial, prosecutor Sir Michael Havers, then attorney general, said: ""Some were prostitutes but perhaps the saddest part of the case is that some were not. The last six attacks were on totally respectable women."" This video can not be played Detectives brought Peter Sutcliffe to justice in 1981 The Sutcliffe case was a humiliation for West Yorkshire police, revealing deep operational and cultural problems within the force and wider policing. Reviews focused on the inquiry's shortcomings in a bungled investigation that never got on top of processing the information it received. The consequence was sweeping reform to the way major crime investigations were conducted. But the investigation was also compromised by the misogyny and racism of 1970s police culture. In 1979, one senior detective told reporters the killer ""has made it clear he hates prostitutes, many people do, but the Ripper is now killing innocent girls."" Police categorised Sutcliffe's victims as ""innocent"" and ""non-innocent"" based on class and lifestyle. Marcella Claxton, a black woman who survived an attack by Sutcliffe in 1976 was racially abused, wrongly labelled a prostitute and her accurate description of the killer was dismissed. The police service is now more diverse but some question whether the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire is right to say attitudes associated with the Ripper investigation are, ""thankfully, consigned to history"". The victims' commissioner Vera Baird points to today's low number of rape prosecutions, suggesting the blaming of victims, particularly when they are women, still continues. The investigation was led at various times by (l to r) Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield, Chief Constable Ronald Gregory and acting Assistant Chief Constable Jim Hobson Dame Louise Casey, the UK's first Victims' Commissioner said she was ""pleased"" to hear the force had apologised adding: ""God forbid we ever go back to those days"". Ruth Bundey, a civil rights layer who later went on to represent some of the Ripper's victims, said: ""It's been a long time coming. I'm glad it's come at last but of course there were some dreadful things said, even at Sutcliffe's trial."" However, former West Yorkshire Police officer Elaine Benson, who worked on the Sutcliffe murders, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme she had not witnessed victims being treated differently. ""I was in the police service for 30 years and things became more politically correct and they were not at that time,"" she said. ""But I did not see from my position that any investigation was any the less for what a person's occupation was or for what they did. ""I never saw anything of that at all. They were murder victims and each murder was investigated as thoroughly as they could investigate it."" Current serving police officers said Sutcliffe was a ""monster"" who should ""rot in hell"" after hearing he had died. Brian Booth, chairman of West Yorkshire Police Federation, said: ""'On hearing of the death of Peter Sutcliffe today, I feel good riddance. ""He is the very reason most people step to the plate and become police officers - to protect our communities from people like him."" John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation, urged people to remember the victims and not Sutcliffe. He tweeted: ""The 13 women he murdered and the 7 who survived his brutal attacks are in my thoughts."" Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM's thoughts were with those who died, their families and friends and with those who survived. He said: ""Peter Sutcliffe was a depraved and evil individual whose crimes caused unimaginable suffering and appalled this country, nothing will ever detract from the harm that he caused, but it is right that he died behind bars for his barbaric murders and for his attempted murders.""

"The number of school-age children with coronavirus has risen ""significantly"" in the second wave compared with the first, according to the government's scientific advisers. Children are now more likely than adults to be the person bringing a Covid infection into a household. But families with children are at no higher risk of severe illness. The National Education Union (NEU) said it was ""troubled"" by the number of children testing positive. The exact role children play in transmitting coronavirus has long been an open question. It's clear young people as a group are at very low risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus themselves. R number for UK has fallen closer to 1 There is also some evidence younger children are less likely to even contract it in the first place. But when it comes to older children, their role in passing on the virus has been much less clear. A review presented to government and published on 13 November outlines the growing evidence older children can catch and transmit Covid-19 at similar rates to adults. From around the time schools reopened in September, a rising number of children have been testing positive for coronavirus, according to the advisory group. But the paper said the extent to which transmission was occurring in schools was ""unproven and difficult to establish"". Two major surveillance studies by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Imperial College London show infections among people aged 16-24 were increasing in September. By October increases could be seen throughout the 2-24-year-old age bracket. There were signs of rising infection in the wider population before schools went back, however. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has previously said reopening schools was likely to increase transmission of the virus. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty also acknowledged this, but said trade-offs would have to be made to allow schools to remain open while controlling the virus. The 13 November advisory paper said there were ""significant educational, developmental and mental health harms from schools being closed"". Schoolchildren and young adults have experienced a much faster rise in infections than other age groups in the second wave. Prof Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh said this was ""not surprising given that schools are operating much closer to normality than most other parts of society"". The review made clear it was not possible to separate contacts in school from contacts around school including travelling to and from, and socialising afterwards. UK coronavirus cases up by 27,301 on Friday However, teachers were no more likely to test positive for coronavirus than other workers, according to ONS data. Dr Sarah Lewis, an epidemiologist at the University of Bristol, said this was ""reassuring"" and suggested ""the measures in place to reduce transmission in schools are working"". People living with secondary-school-age children were 8% more likely to catch the virus. Butresearch by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Oxfordfound that people living with under-18s had no increased risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid. The NEU said it was concerned by the ""finding that children aged 12-16 played a 'significantly higher role' in introducing infection into households in the period after schools reopened their doors to all students"". The union suggested this was down to ""the difficulty of social distancing, the absence of face masks inside classrooms, the problems of ventilation, the size of 'bubbles' and the cross mixing on school transport, as well as of secondary pupils mixing outside school"".

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Level 4 'under consideration' in the west Areas in the west of Scotland have been warned they may be placed under the highest level of Covid restrictions next week. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said contact had been made with councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas. They were told it was possible that restrictions may need to be increased from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. A Scottish retail trade association said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the prospect of shops having to shut during the festive season. The Scottish government confirmed on Friday evening it had made contact with every council in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area - in most cases at chief executive level - to discuss the current situation. The chief executives of both North and South Lanarkshire Councils were also called. A spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government officials make regular contact with all local authorities to discuss plans for protection measures before these are finalised."" Mr Swinney said increases in Covid cases had also been seen in other areas, including Stirling, which is also currently in level three, and Aberdeenshire, which is in level two. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Fife, Perth & Kinross and Angus move into level 3 He said the national incident management team would be looking at the data over the weekend. Discussions will also take place with councils before ministers meet on Tuesday to take any decisions. Mr Swinney added that there were ""wider issues"" which would also need to be considered, such as the social and economic harm which could be caused by moving an area into level four. The highest level of coronavirus restrictions is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. The guidelines say it will only be used if ""absolutely necessary"", at a time when cases are very high and there is a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. In response to the announcement, Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, called for the implementation of blended learning in areas which move into level four, amid concerns about school safety. The union said the growing number of pupils and teachers infected with Covid-19 raised issues over the effectiveness of virus mitigations in schools. The Scottish Retail Consortium said jobs would be lost if shops cannot trade during the festive season, which many rely on to boost winter sales. Director David Lonsdale said: ""It's already been an especially gloomy year for retail - but shop closures prior to Christmas would take us even deeper into the darkness."" Several councils confirmed they were in talks over the level 4 move. A spokesperson for North Lanarkshire said:  ""The council continues to engage with the Scottish government on the most appropriate level for North Lanarkshire to be in and we are actively encouraging residents to continue to comply with national guidance."" South Lanarkshire said it was in ""constructive dialogue"" with the Scottish government and East Renfrewshire also said discussions were continuing. The EIS union has called for the re-introduction of blended learning in level 4 areas A Renfrewshire Council spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government have contacted us, and we are in discussion with them. No decision has been taken and Renfrewshire remains in level three at present. ""The council is committed to doing everything possible to help keep Renfrewshire communities out of further restrictions and local businesses open. We are asking all of Renfrewshire to work together to stop transmission of this virus, keep our communities safe and protect local jobs."" At the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Swinney said: ""I can confirm that officials in the Scottish government have been in contact with a number of local authorities in the west of Scotland about the possibility of the area having to be increased from level three to level four. He added that a number of other local authorities around the country had been contacted because they had seen ""quite significant"" increases in rates of the virus. Mr Swinney added that the numbers were ""so stubbornly high"" in some level three areas that it raised a question of whether the restrictions were doing enough to suppress the virus. Mr Swinney added that if any area was moved into level four, this would need to be for ""a reasonable amount of time"" so that the effect of the restrictions could be seen.

"Waiting for the actual exam results is the fairest way of allocating places, say experts Universities in England are to switch to offering degree places on the basis of actual grades rather than predicted ones, the government has announced. In an interview with BBC Education Editor Branwen Jeffreys, Gavin Williamson said the present system held bright but disadvantaged pupils back. He said he wanted all students to be able to choose the best university they can go to once they know their grades. Universities have just backed such a change following a review. Currently, pupils are offered places from universities ahead of their results, so decisions are based on predictions made by their teachers. Universities may ditch predicted grades on offers University applications could be after A-levels Once A-level, BTEC and other exam results are issued in August, candidates then accept or refuse offers they have received. A consultation will be carried out but it is expected the change to what is known as a post-qualification admissions system will take place before the next general election. The current system relies heavily on predicted grades which puts academically high achieving pupils from poorer areas at a disadvantage. Research this year from University College London,externalfound 23% of pupils from comprehensives were under-predicted by two or more grades, compared to just 11% of grammar and private school pupils. But there are still big questions about how this would work, with universities favouring a system in which students would still apply before exams but receive offers afterwards. Others may push for the more radical option of both applications and offers being made after results, pushing the start of term back to January for first year students. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson: ""I want to smash through these ceilings"" Mr Williamson told the BBC: ""I want all students to look at the grades they've got and then see what is the best university that they can get to, what is the best course they can do. ""I want to smash through these ceilings that are preventing them from meeting their full potential."" He said pupils from less-affluent, non-traditional backgrounds often did not have to the confidence to aim for a highly selective university, and also often lacked advice about how to reach such goals. The move comes after years of debate over post-qualification admissions. Numerous academic studies suggest pupils from working class backgrounds, and some ethnic groups, tend to be predicted lower grades by their teachers. The university admissions system was brought into sharp focus in the summer, when exam results were cancelled, leading to thousands of students losing the places they thought they had not qualified for. Universities promised to offer as many places as they could if candidates received the grades they needed after results were re-issued. Mr Williamson said the use of predicted grades limited ""the aspirations of students before they know what they can achieve"". ""We need to radically change a system which breeds low aspiration and unfairness,"" he added. ""We're going to deliver this before next election, we're going to do an extensive consultation. ""But there's a real determination what we've seen in this pandemic, we've seen great challenges that society has had to deal with and as we move out of this pandemic we need to build back better."" Mr Williamson also criticised universities which offer inducements or conditional unconditional offers to some students to lure them on to their courses. ""What we've seen over the last few years is what I describe as a little bit of sharp practice where universities have been offering unconditional offers, more and more and creating incentives, in terms of offering laptops or cash back to those students, and that means those students aren't choosing the  course and the university that is best to meet their future potential. ""We want to move away from that."" The plan has received a warm welcome from vice-chancellors' organisation, Universities UK, who had resolved to move to post qualification admissions following an 18-months review. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""The current system is based on inaccurately predicted results and leads to those from less-affluent backgrounds losing out. ""Allowing students to apply after they receive their results will help level the playing field and put a stop to the chaotic clearing scramble."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Teachers work hard and diligently to provide accurate predicted grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. He agreed: ""Post-qualification admissions would be better and fairer.""

"Almost 23 million people watched Martin Bashir's Panorama interview with Princess Diana in 1995 A previously missing note from Princess Diana, thought to indicate she was happy with the way her interview by BBC Panorama was obtained, has been found. The BBC said it had recovered the ""original handwritten note"" that the princess wrote following the Panorama interview of November 1995. The broadcaster said it would hand over the note to an independent inquiry. The probe will look at claims made by Diana's brother about how BBC reporter Martin Bashir secured the interview. Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor, is recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 and has been unable to comment on Charles Spencer's allegations. Earl Spencer called for an independent inquiry earlier this month and said he would never have introduced Bashir to his sister if he had not seen the faked bank statements. The faked statements wrongly purported to show that the earl's former head of security had been paid by a newspaper group and a mysterious offshore company. The BBC has apologised for the faked bank statements, but it says the note from the princess says she did not see them and insisted they played ""no part in her decision to take part in the interview"". The BBC's not saying how the letter came back into its possession - but it clearly hopes it will help its case when the independent investigation looks into the allegations made by Earl Spencer. The letter is believed to say that Diana was not influenced by the forged bank statements Martin Bashir had made - and was happy with the way the interview was secured. If the princess was unaware of or untroubled by the forgeries, or the alleged deceit, it will help the BBC's defence: it says the original investigation was into whether the princess had been misled into giving the interview. A note from her saying she hadn't would clearly weigh heavily. But the note does not address Earl Spencer's central allegation. He alleges that the forged documents were part of a series of lies he was told by Bashir, lies that were meant to win his trust and thus gain access to Diana. What we know of the rediscovered note from Diana doesn't address the serious allegations of journalistic misconduct Earl Spencer has made. Nor does it help resolve the question of how much the BBC knew back in 1996 when it said the forgeries played no part in securing the interview. Nearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded almost 25 years ago, on 20 November 1995. The interview made headlines when the princess said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. Earlier this monththe Daily Mail published notes Earl Spencer says he made,externalwith Bashir two months before the interview. 'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade Diana's brother demands BBC inquiry over interview BBC's Martin Bashir 'seriously unwell' from Covid Our correspondent Jonny Dymond said the notes appeared to record Bashir ""spinning lie after lie about members of the Royal Family, and its staff, in an attempt, Earl Spencer says, to win his trust and that of his sister"". These claims, described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"", include that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped. It was also claimed that her bodyguard was plotting against her and close friends were betraying her by leaking stories to the press. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in a Paris underpass.

"Staff at this hospital in Naples treated waiting patients in their cars because the wards were overwhelmed Italy has added more regions to its coronavirus high-risk ""red zones"" as cases across the country hit a new daily record. Campania and Tuscany will join other regions placed under the strictest lockdown measures from Sunday. Authorities in Campania, which includes Naples, have warned that the health system there is close to collapse. Friday's announcement came as Italy confirmed 40,902 new infections - its highest ever daily total. It passed the one million mark earlier this week and there have been more than 44,000 deaths. The government's coronavirus consultant, Walter Ricciardi, told reporters that the country has ""two to three weeks to decide whether to impose a new national lockdown"". Earlier this year Italy became the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe but brought its outbreak under control with a tough national lockdown. Restrictions were gradually lifted as cases eased but last week - faced with a second wave of infections, it introduced new measures. Too early for Christmas plans, Europeans warned How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Regions are divided into three zones - red for the highest risk, then orange and yellow. In the red zone at the moment are Lombardy, Bolzano, Piedmont and Aosta Valley in the north, and Calabria in the south. In these areas, which cover about 16.5 million people in a population of 60 million, residents can only leave home for work, health reasons, essential shopping or emergencies. All non-essential shops are closed. Bars and restaurants are also shut but people can exercise near their homes if they wear masks. Hairdressers can remain open. Restaurant workers in Rome protested against the latest restrictions on Friday A quarter of the new cases are in Lombardy, which includes Milan. It was the worst-hit area in Italy's first outbreak and it was Europe's first coronavirus hotspot. Campania, however, has shot straight from the yellow zone to red as a spike in cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals. ""The situation in Campania is out of control,"" Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told La Stampa newspaper on Friday. ""We need urgent restrictions... people are dying."" SMS request to go out, red zones - Europe lockdown Italian media has broadcast shocking scenes from hospitals in Naples. Staff at one hospital have brought oxygen tanks and other equipment outside to treat people parked in their cars because the emergency department was swamped with cases. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? ""We have almost no more beds available,"" Rodolfo Punzi, an official at Cotugno hospital, told AFP news agency. Also this week a video went viral of an elderly suspected Covid patient found dead in the toilet of the Cardarelli hospital emergency department in Naples. His granddaughter called it ""an outrage to human dignity"" and accused staff of neglect. Lockdowns and other measures are in force in several European countries experiencing a second wave of the virus. In other developments: Greece has imposed a night-time curfew from 21:00 to 05:00 from Friday, after a surge in cases Portugal has significantly expanded its overnight curfew. From Monday, three-quarters of the country will be under the government's toughest restrictions Germany has reported a new record of 23,542 daily infections, dampening hopes that a national partial lockdown might be lifted soon Ukraine has also registered a record number of new Covid-19 cases - 11,787 in 24 hours.

"Northern Ireland's first minister said she regrets how the executive has handled the decision over extending Covid-19 restrictions this week. Arlene Foster said it had been a ""torturous example of how not to take decisions"". On Thursday,restrictions were extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday. Close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on 20 November. The currentrestrictions came into effect on 16 Octoberand were to expire at midnight on Friday. As the fall-out continued, Finance Minister Conor Murphy of Sinn FÃ©in said that the DUP's decision to block the health minister's proposal for a two-week extension was ""reprehensible"". The latest paper, brought by the DUP after several days of disagreement, was signed off late on Thursday afternoon. Speaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Mrs Foster said ""all I am trying to do"" is find a balanced way forward. ""We need to look to the future and move on from this very difficult week for everyone in Northern Ireland watching as we struggled to make decisions,"" she said. ""All the decisions we take in relation to medical advice is advice based on modelling - not predictions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs Foster also accused Sinn FÃ©in of ""trying to isolate the DUP"", after the party deployed a cross-community mechanism to block proposals to extend the restrictions for two weeks. The first minister said if she had been chairing the executive meetings, she would not have pushed the decisions to a vote but that Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill had been overseeing the discussions. She also accused Sinn FÃ©in of performing a ""reverse ferret"" on its position in opposing the deal. ""Agreements that were reached were broken, however we have now reached a consensus,"" said Mrs Foster. Speaking on Thursday, the deputy first minister said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan. Ms O'Neill told BBC Newsline that only imposing one more week of restrictions ""potentially means we're coming back to this situation before Christmas"". Mrs Foster said the chief medical officer had indicated even with the extra two weeks there was a ""chance that we could have to come back to a lockdown before Christmas"". Conor Murphy says a majority vote at the executive should carried the proposal for a two-week extension Sinn FÃ©in's Finance Minister Conor Murphy told Good Morning Ulster the DUPs blocking of the health minister's original proposal of a two-week extension was ""reprehensible"". ""We would not stoop to the level that the DUP has stooped to in order to get our way. ""We believe in the democratic process, we believe the executive has a right to vote by a majority for things,"" he said ""If there is an issue that will detrimentally impact on one section of the community, that's what that mechanism is for - it's not to be used willy nilly. ""Six ministers voted in favour of the health minister's original proposition, that's four out of the five parties. That should have been sufficient in order to carry it."" The chair of NI's British Medical Association (BMA) said Northern Ireland should be placed in a national lockdown, rather than the circuit breaker extended by a week. Speaking to Sky News, Dr Tom Black said seven hospitals were operating over capacity. ""Our EDs are chock-a-block, our intensive care units are full and trying to expand,"" he added. He said that in that context, a complete lockdown would ""have been expected"". ""We got a decision that is not competent, certainly negligent, and a betrayal of health care workers,"" he said. Close contact services including hair salons will reopen, by appointment, on 20 November There has been a mixed reaction from businesses in Northern Ireland to the agreement reached by the executive on Covid-19 restrictions. Rosemary Wright, who owns Ashburn Image hair and beauty salon in Eglinton, had already started taking bookings for Saturday but is now busy rescheduling appointments. ""They [the executive] should've made a decision far earlier, they had four weeks to say yes or no but they kept us waiting and now we have to wait another week. ""I am sitting here thinking now are we even going to open next Friday."" The salon owner has said despite being closed for over four weeks she hasnot received any financial support from the government. ""I applied for it, but I still have nothing. Not a penny. No furlough money, not even a grant,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. ""We still have to pay our bills, I still have to pay staff, my staff are waiting each week to be paid and I have nothing coming in. ""I would say to the people on the hill have your money cut off and see how you feel. It is not easy."" Driving instructor John O'Donnell from Derry said he would not be going back to work yet ""irrespective of what Stormont says"". ""The chief medical officer is the expert - he says we need another two weeks extension and they are horse-trading over it. You can't horse trade over people's lives,"" he said ""I sympathise with businesses - mine is suffering as well, but I can always build my business up again. You can't dig up a grave and bring people back from the dead. ""I am not going to put myself in a position of getting Covid-19 or any of my clients."" This video can not be played Janice Gault of the Hotels Federation said brides wanted to know if their imminent weddings would go ahead Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation told BBC One NI's The View programme that 35% of hotel rooms in Northern Ireland had been booked this weekend. She said 3,000 phone calls had to be made on Thursday after the executive made a decision to keep hotels closed for two more weeks. She added: ""What many people forget is we had brides who are getting married this Saturday on the phone this afternoon asking could they get married."" Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said he hoped the announcement would ""result in thousands of jobs and businesses being saved"". ""While pubs and restaurants may be closed, the bills continue to mount on a daily basis therefore extra financial support is needed now to protect businesses and jobs and we hope that the NI Executive will be swift in getting this money into bank accounts."" The document agreed by the executive also says that support will be provided for mitigations to reduce risk within the hospitality sector, including improved ventilation and requirements for the recording of customer information for contact tracing purposes. Hair and beauty salons and driving instructors will reopen, by appointment, next Friday Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on 20 November, but with a closing time of 20:00 GMT Alcohol cannot be purchased or consumed on such premises Pubs and bars will be permitted to sell sealed off sales on 20 November Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November, as the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced on 16 October will expire at midnight on 26 November Restrictions on visiting people in their homes and gardens remain in place What are the lockdown rules where you live?

"The R number for the UK has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

"About 4,000 people are empolyed at the Tata Steel plant in Port Talbot Tata Steel has announced plans to make its UK business, based mainly in Port Talbot, ""self-sustaining"" while selling its Netherlands-based operations. Tata Steel said it planned to sell the European arm of its business and keep the UK business running without financial support from India. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news was ""extremely worrying"" for Tata's 8,000 UK workers. Tata said it was speaking to the UK government about the business's future. The UK government said: ""This is a commercial decision forÂ Tata Steel. We will continue to work withÂ Tata Steel and other stakeholders as the company shapes its business strategy for the future.Â Â ""The UK governmentÂ remains committed to supporting a sustainable, long-term future for steel making in the UK.""Â Tata said it is ""reviewing options"" to make its UK business run without funding support from India The India-based business announced Swedish steel firm SSAB had initiated talks about the acquisition of its business in the Netherlands, including its steelworks at Ijmuiden, north-west of Amsterdam. Tata said it plans to separate the UK and Netherlands arms of the business and ""will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and UK business in the future"". It added: ""Tata Steel continues its dialogue with the UK government on potential measures to safeguard the long-term future of Tata Steel UK and is also reviewing all options to make the business self-sustaining without the need for any funding support from Tata Steel India in the future."" About half of Tata's 8,000 UK workers are based at Port Talbot, with several other sites around Wales and the rest of the UK. 'Thousands' of jobs fears over reported Tata plans Tata Steel in government talks amid bailout reports T V Narendran, CEO and managing director of Tata, said: ""We are continuing our discussions with the UK government regarding the future strategy of our UK business."" Mr Skates said: ""Today's announcement will be extremely worrying for Tata Steel workers across Wales, their families, local communities and the supply chain, but we know the steel industry has a future in Wales and the UK. ""The first minister and I spoke with Tata today and they said they are determined to find a sustainable future for operations in the UK and to safeguard the 8,000 workforce, most of which are in Wales. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news would be ""extremely worrying"" for steelworkers ""The first minister is seeking urgent talks with the prime minister and I will speak to the secretary of state for BEIS (business, energy and industrial strategy) and the secretary of state for Wales to call for urgent action. ""The industry is now waiting for the UK government to take immediate action to safeguard the sector and protect jobs. Every day they are not at the table is another day lost for workers and for an industry of strategic importance."" Concerns have been issued over Tata's future several times in recent years, withAberavon MP Stephen Kinnock saying in July that a plan to shut off two blast furnaces and replace them with electric arch furnacesraised ""massive questions"" about the future of the industry. He also said the company wouldneed a Â£500m bailout to get through the coronavirus pandemic. David Rees, the Labour MS for Aberavon, said in atweet,external: ""Once again our steelworkers are facing challenging times following this news. Almost five years ago they and their families went through hell as their livelihoods came under threat with the then announcement of a proposed sale of the Tata steel plants in Wales ""Today, those concerns have been resurrected with the announcement that Tata Steel Europe is likely to be split with the Dutch components being sold to Swedish steelmaker SSAB leaving the UK element to stand alone.""

Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said she was ""not surprised"" by Tata's announcement. She said: ""The company has made no secret of the fact it's wanted to offload the European side of the business. ""Previous negotiations have fallen through and we've had the pandemic which has depressed the market. ""It's made things difficult for automotive industry - which is a major steel customer - and there's still uncertainty in the future."" Tony Brady, from the Unite union, said it was ""essential"" that Tata is able to keep trading with the EU after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. He said: ""Today's news effectively means that Tata's European steel business will now be based solely in the UK. ""With Brexit fast approaching it is essential that Tata's UK steel business is able to continue trading effectively across the European Union. ""This means that it is crucial that the UK comes to a trade agreement with the EU in the coming weeks. The UK government have told us that Brexit will be good for Britain and British jobs, they must deliver on that promise."" Meanwhile, Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community Union, said Tata must now ""reaffirm their commitment to the UK"". He said: ""We will challenge Tata at every turn and rest assured we will protect our members' interests. Should we conclude the separation of Tata Steel UK would place our members' livelihoods at risk then we will vigorously oppose the break-up of the company. ""There is no doubt a sustainable future for Tata Steel UK depends on Tata and the government concluding a deal that will support the transition to low-carbon steelmaking. He added: ""There are many challenges ahead but we know Tata Steel UK can have a bright future. ""We take confidence from the fact our steelworkers are the best in the world. Under the right leadership, given the right tools, and the chance to compete on a level playing field, we back ourselves to compete with the world's best.""

"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Kuenssberg: What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

"He's spent nearly two decades working with Conservative politicians in the upper reaches of government - but many of us hadn't heard of Dominic Cummings until his infamous lockdown trip to Barnard Castle earlier this year. Now thatthe prime minister's chief adviser is leaving Downing Street, we look back at some memorable moments in his career. Mr Cummings became a household name after he defended his 260-mile drive from his home in London to his parents' farm in County Durham during the UK's national coronavirus lockdown in March. Following pressure from all political sides to explain why he went against the government's ""stay at home"" messaging, Mr Cummings said he made the journey for childcare reasons after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms. But a subsequent outing, this time from the cottage on his parents' farm to the historic market town of Barnard Castle, was the trip thatgave fuel to meme-makers across the country,external. Mr Cummings said the reason for that trip was to test his eyesight and his readiness to drive back to London. Cummings: I don't regret what I did Timeline: Did Cummings break the rules? Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row The success of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum no doubt helped to secure Mr Cummings' job in Downing Street, as it was his role during that which cemented his strong bond with Boris Johnson. Mr Cummings, the campaign's director, was credited with the ""take back control"" slogan that appeared to strike a chord with so many referendum voters, as well as the claim that Britain could save Â£350m a week by leaving the EU. The politics behind the Â£350m figure Boris Johnson became prime minister after his part in the successful campaign for the UK to leave the European Union In addition to his snappy slogans, Mr Cummings has also hurled some infamous insults at politicians - often through the medium of his personal blog. For example, he has said: Brexit Secretary David Davis is""thick as mince"",externaland as ""lazy as a toad"" Computer-animated superhero team PJ Maskswould do a better job than the cabinet MPs who want to disrespect the EU referendum result are""pirates"",external Some MPs who wanted to leave the EU were ""idiots"" andshould be treated like a ""tumour"",external This video can not be played Cummings: ""We need PJ Masks on the job"" Mr Cummings' blog also drew headlines when he used it to tout his ideas to shake up the civil service. In a blog post in January this year,external, he said the civil service lacked people with ""deep expertise in specific fields"" and called for ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to get in touch with him via a private Gmail address if they wanted to work in government. The post stoked tensions, with the civil servants' union saying staff were recruited on merit and ""because of what you can do, not what you believe"". PM's aide Cummings calls for civil service changes The departure of civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill (pictured welcoming Boris Johnson to Downing Street, with Mr Cummings on the right) sped up Mr Cummings' ideas for Whitehall reform, our political editor Laura Kuenssberg said The clashes with other civil servants reached new heights after a special adviser was sacked and escorted out of Downing Street by police, following a confrontation with Mr Cummings. No reason was given for Sonia Khan's dismissal in August 2019, but it's thought she had been accused by Mr Cummings of leaking details of a no-deal Brexit exercise to the media. Her then-boss (and then-chancellor) Sajid Javid ""voiced his anger"" with the PM over her treatment, later resigning when Mr Johnson ordered him to fire his team of aides. Labour said Mr Javid's departure showed Mr Cummings had ""won the battle to take absolute control of the Treasury"".

According to Buzzfeed News, Mr Cummings was greatly frustrated by the prime minister's rejection of his proposal to change Downing Street's office layout. The top aide wanted to knock walls through and put desks in circles around both him and Mr Johnson, who would sit in the centre,the Buzzfeed report claims.,external The news site claims the plans were rejected as unworkable - in part as a result of No 10's status as a Grade One listed building. As a listed building, No 10 Downing Street has extra legal protection within the planning system (leaf-sweeping is allowed though) The penny must drop that you've had an interesting career when you hear an Oscar-nominated actor is preparing to play you in a TV drama.

"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Kuenssberg: What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

Detectives, journalists and the attorney general who prosecuted Sutcliffe have been criticised for dismissing some women who died as sex workers. Senior officers' focus on the killer targeting only sex workers was seen as one of the many crucial wrong turns taken during the 1970s investigation.

This video can not be played Detectives brought Peter Sutcliffe to justice in 1981 The Sutcliffe case was a humiliation for West Yorkshire police, revealing deep operational and cultural problems within the force and wider policing. Reviews focused on the inquiry's shortcomings in a bungled investigation that never got on top of processing the information it received. The consequence was sweeping reform to the way major crime investigations were conducted. But the investigation was also compromised by the misogyny and racism of 1970s police culture. In 1979, one senior detective told reporters the killer ""has made it clear he hates prostitutes, many people do, but the Ripper is now killing innocent girls."" Police categorised Sutcliffe's victims as ""innocent"" and ""non-innocent"" based on class and lifestyle.

"Almost 23 million people watched Martin Bashir's Panorama interview with Princess Diana in 1995 A previously missing note from Princess Diana, thought to indicate she was happy with the way her interview by BBC Panorama was obtained, has been found. The BBC said it had recovered the ""original handwritten note"" that the princess wrote following the Panorama interview of November 1995. The broadcaster said it would hand over the note to an independent inquiry. The probe will look at claims made by Diana's brother about how BBC reporter Martin Bashir secured the interview. Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor, is recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 and has been unable to comment on Charles Spencer's allegations. Earl Spencer called for an independent inquiry earlier this month and said he would never have introduced Bashir to his sister if he had not seen the faked bank statements. The faked statements wrongly purported to show that the earl's former head of security had been paid by a newspaper group and a mysterious offshore company. The BBC has apologised for the faked bank statements, but it says the note from the princess says she did not see them and insisted they played ""no part in her decision to take part in the interview"". The BBC's not saying how the letter came back into its possession - but it clearly hopes it will help its case when the independent investigation looks into the allegations made by Earl Spencer. The letter is believed to say that Diana was not influenced by the forged bank statements Martin Bashir had made - and was happy with the way the interview was secured. If the princess was unaware of or untroubled by the forgeries, or the alleged deceit, it will help the BBC's defence: it says the original investigation was into whether the princess had been misled into giving the interview. A note from her saying she hadn't would clearly weigh heavily. But the note does not address Earl Spencer's central allegation. He alleges that the forged documents were part of a series of lies he was told by Bashir, lies that were meant to win his trust and thus gain access to Diana. What we know of the rediscovered note from Diana doesn't address the serious allegations of journalistic misconduct Earl Spencer has made. Nor does it help resolve the question of how much the BBC knew back in 1996 when it said the forgeries played no part in securing the interview. Nearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded almost 25 years ago, on 20 November 1995. The interview made headlines when the princess said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. Earlier this monththe Daily Mail published notes Earl Spencer says he made,externalwith Bashir two months before the interview. 'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade Diana's brother demands BBC inquiry over interview BBC's Martin Bashir 'seriously unwell' from Covid Our correspondent Jonny Dymond said the notes appeared to record Bashir ""spinning lie after lie about members of the Royal Family, and its staff, in an attempt, Earl Spencer says, to win his trust and that of his sister"". These claims, described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"", include that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped. It was also claimed that her bodyguard was plotting against her and close friends were betraying her by leaking stories to the press. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in a Paris underpass.

"Waiting for the actual exam results is the fairest way of allocating places, say experts Universities in England are to switch to offering degree places on the basis of actual grades rather than predicted ones, the government has announced. In an interview with BBC Education Editor Branwen Jeffreys, Gavin Williamson said the present system held bright but disadvantaged pupils back. He said he wanted all students to be able to choose the best university they can go to once they know their grades. Universities have just backed such a change following a review. Currently, pupils are offered places from universities ahead of their results, so decisions are based on predictions made by their teachers. Universities may ditch predicted grades on offers University applications could be after A-levels Once A-level, BTEC and other exam results are issued in August, candidates then accept or refuse offers they have received. A consultation will be carried out but it is expected the change to what is known as a post-qualification admissions system will take place before the next general election. The current system relies heavily on predicted grades which puts academically high achieving pupils from poorer areas at a disadvantage. Research this year from University College London,externalfound 23% of pupils from comprehensives were under-predicted by two or more grades, compared to just 11% of grammar and private school pupils. But there are still big questions about how this would work, with universities favouring a system in which students would still apply before exams but receive offers afterwards. Others may push for the more radical option of both applications and offers being made after results, pushing the start of term back to January for first year students. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson: ""I want to smash through these ceilings"" Mr Williamson told the BBC: ""I want all students to look at the grades they've got and then see what is the best university that they can get to, what is the best course they can do. ""I want to smash through these ceilings that are preventing them from meeting their full potential."" He said pupils from less-affluent, non-traditional backgrounds often did not have to the confidence to aim for a highly selective university, and also often lacked advice about how to reach such goals. The move comes after years of debate over post-qualification admissions. Numerous academic studies suggest pupils from working class backgrounds, and some ethnic groups, tend to be predicted lower grades by their teachers. The university admissions system was brought into sharp focus in the summer, when exam results were cancelled, leading to thousands of students losing the places they thought they had not qualified for. Universities promised to offer as many places as they could if candidates received the grades they needed after results were re-issued. Mr Williamson said the use of predicted grades limited ""the aspirations of students before they know what they can achieve"". ""We need to radically change a system which breeds low aspiration and unfairness,"" he added. ""We're going to deliver this before next election, we're going to do an extensive consultation. ""But there's a real determination what we've seen in this pandemic, we've seen great challenges that society has had to deal with and as we move out of this pandemic we need to build back better."" Mr Williamson also criticised universities which offer inducements or conditional unconditional offers to some students to lure them on to their courses. ""What we've seen over the last few years is what I describe as a little bit of sharp practice where universities have been offering unconditional offers, more and more and creating incentives, in terms of offering laptops or cash back to those students, and that means those students aren't choosing the  course and the university that is best to meet their future potential. ""We want to move away from that."" The plan has received a warm welcome from vice-chancellors' organisation, Universities UK, who had resolved to move to post qualification admissions following an 18-months review. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""The current system is based on inaccurately predicted results and leads to those from less-affluent backgrounds losing out. ""Allowing students to apply after they receive their results will help level the playing field and put a stop to the chaotic clearing scramble."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Teachers work hard and diligently to provide accurate predicted grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. He agreed: ""Post-qualification admissions would be better and fairer.""

"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were all broken into last December A team of burglars made off with Â£26m of property from the London homes of three celebrities, a court has heard. Watches and jewellery belonging to the football boss Frank Lampard, heiress Tamara Ecclestone and the family of tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken last December. Maria Mester, Emil Bogdan Savastru, Alexandru Stan and Sorin Marcovici deny conspiracy to burgle. They were the ""support cast"" to the alleged burglars, jurors were told. At Isleworth Crown Court, the jury was told the conspiracy was ""one of the largest ever in this country"" and that the raids happened over the space of two weeks in the run-up to Christmas. Four other people allegedly carried out the burglaries, but they cannot be named for legal reasons, the court was told. Prosecutor Timothy Cray QC said the four people on trial had a role in what had been a ""sophisticated"" plan. First, the west London home of the Chelsea manager and his wife Christine Lampard was raided on 1 December. A diamond watch, cufflinks and a clock worth an estimated Â£60,000 were taken, the court heard. Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the Srivaddhanaprabha family was targeted. It was billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's home before his death in a helicopter crash in October 2018. This time, 400,000 euros in cash was taken, as well as expensive watches, the court heard. The following day, the alleged burglars toasted the success of the raid on the Knightsbridge mansion, the court heard, enjoying a Â£760 champagne and sashimi lunch at the Zuma restaurant, five minutes' walk from the crime scene. Tamara Ecclestone was the celebrity who suffered the biggest financial hit The final burglary, on the palatial home near Kensington Palace that socialite Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland, saw about Â£25m worth of valuables stolen. Mr Cray said Ms Ecclestone's team of security guards missed the men coming on to the property, adding: ""The house is just so big that the guys didn't realise the burglary was going on until it was well under way."" Mr Cray added: ""The burglaries netted big money - in round figures Â£26m worth of property was stolen, mainly in some fabulous jewellery and in cold hard cash. ""Virtually all that property has never been seen again. It was successfully laundered - concealed and disguised and got rid of."" He added: ""They were international crimes. Parts of the evidence look like a  pre-Covid arrivals board at a London airport, with people flying in and out of Italy, Sweden, Japan and then being seen in the more ritzy parts of London - Harrods, Chelsea, a swish restaurant in Knightsbridge, while taking care to have safe bases that were a little bit more off the beaten track, down near Orpington and then over in Fulham."" Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash in 2018 He told the court that by 18 December all of those involved in the burglaries had left the UK. Mr Cray said Mr Savastru, of Bethnal Green, was the first of the team to be arrested, at Heathrow Airport on 30 January, as he tried to board a flight to Japan. Jurors heard that when the 30-year-old was detained he was wearing a Tag Heuer watch which had belonged to Mr Srivaddhanaprabha and a Louis Vuitton bag that Mr Rutland bought in 2011. The prosecution alleges that Mr Stan, Ms Mester, Mr Marcovici and Mr Savastru were all involved at various times in the conspiracy to burgle the three homes. Mr Stan is alleged to have dropped out after the Lampard raid to be replaced with Ms Mester and Mr Marcovici, the latter then being substituted with Ms Mester's son Mr Savastru for the Ecclestone job. Mr Savastru's defence barrister told the court he assumed the items ""had been left for him"" by the alleged burglars. His mother, Ms Mester, 47, was the next person to be arrested the following day as she got off flight at Stansted from Milan. Mr Cray said she was wearing Â£3,000 earrings that belonged to Ms Ecclestone. Ms Mester's defence barrister said she was given the items as a gift having spent a week as a ""call girl"" in December.

She told BBC News the project had been a lifeline when quarantine threatened to overwhelm her. ""It's hard to dig deep and stay positive,""the 52-year-old said, ""and I had a moment like that, during the first lockdown where I had to confess to someone else that I was struggling.

"Matiu Ratana, known as Matt, moved to the UK in 1989 and joined the Met Police two years later A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a police officer who was shot dead at Croydon custody centre. New Zealand-born Sgt Matiu Ratana, 54, known as Matt, was shot in the chest as a handcuffed suspect was being taken into custody on 25 September. Louis De Zoysa, 23, also suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital in a critical condition. The Met Police said he had since ""stabilised"" and was considered fit to be arrested on Friday. Mr De Zoysa remains in hospital with ""life-changing injuries"" and detectives will consult with doctors and legal advisers before they begin interviewing him. The Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said of the arrest: ""It's an important milestone and hopefully it brings some tiny comfort to Matt's partner Su, Matt's wider family and everyone who has been affected. ""The investigation is moving on into a dreadful, dreadful homicide."" Louis De Zoysa has been left with ""life-changing injuries"" following the shooting An inquest at South London Coroner's Court in October heard Sgt Ratana died from a gunshot wound to the chest. No police firearms were discharged in the shooting. Earlier this month,a funeral for the long-serving officerwas held at Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, and live streamed on the internet so his family, friends and colleagues around the world could attend.

"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were all broken into last December A team of burglars made off with Â£26m of property from the London homes of three celebrities, a court has heard. Watches and jewellery belonging to the football boss Frank Lampard, heiress Tamara Ecclestone and the family of tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken last December. Maria Mester, Emil Bogdan Savastru, Alexandru Stan and Sorin Marcovici deny conspiracy to burgle. They were the ""support cast"" to the alleged burglars, jurors were told. At Isleworth Crown Court, the jury was told the conspiracy was ""one of the largest ever in this country"" and that the raids happened over the space of two weeks in the run-up to Christmas. Four other people allegedly carried out the burglaries, but they cannot be named for legal reasons, the court was told. Prosecutor Timothy Cray QC said the four people on trial had a role in what had been a ""sophisticated"" plan. First, the west London home of the Chelsea manager and his wife Christine Lampard was raided on 1 December. A diamond watch, cufflinks and a clock worth an estimated Â£60,000 were taken, the court heard. Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the Srivaddhanaprabha family was targeted. It was billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's home before his death in a helicopter crash in October 2018. This time, 400,000 euros in cash was taken, as well as expensive watches, the court heard. The following day, the alleged burglars toasted the success of the raid on the Knightsbridge mansion, the court heard, enjoying a Â£760 champagne and sashimi lunch at the Zuma restaurant, five minutes' walk from the crime scene. Tamara Ecclestone was the celebrity who suffered the biggest financial hit The final burglary, on the palatial home near Kensington Palace that socialite Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland, saw about Â£25m worth of valuables stolen. Mr Cray said Ms Ecclestone's team of security guards missed the men coming on to the property, adding: ""The house is just so big that the guys didn't realise the burglary was going on until it was well under way."" Mr Cray added: ""The burglaries netted big money - in round figures Â£26m worth of property was stolen, mainly in some fabulous jewellery and in cold hard cash. ""Virtually all that property has never been seen again. It was successfully laundered - concealed and disguised and got rid of."" He added: ""They were international crimes. Parts of the evidence look like a  pre-Covid arrivals board at a London airport, with people flying in and out of Italy, Sweden, Japan and then being seen in the more ritzy parts of London - Harrods, Chelsea, a swish restaurant in Knightsbridge, while taking care to have safe bases that were a little bit more off the beaten track, down near Orpington and then over in Fulham."" Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash in 2018 He told the court that by 18 December all of those involved in the burglaries had left the UK. Mr Cray said Mr Savastru, of Bethnal Green, was the first of the team to be arrested, at Heathrow Airport on 30 January, as he tried to board a flight to Japan. Jurors heard that when the 30-year-old was detained he was wearing a Tag Heuer watch which had belonged to Mr Srivaddhanaprabha and a Louis Vuitton bag that Mr Rutland bought in 2011. The prosecution alleges that Mr Stan, Ms Mester, Mr Marcovici and Mr Savastru were all involved at various times in the conspiracy to burgle the three homes. Mr Stan is alleged to have dropped out after the Lampard raid to be replaced with Ms Mester and Mr Marcovici, the latter then being substituted with Ms Mester's son Mr Savastru for the Ecclestone job. Mr Savastru's defence barrister told the court he assumed the items ""had been left for him"" by the alleged burglars. His mother, Ms Mester, 47, was the next person to be arrested the following day as she got off flight at Stansted from Milan. Mr Cray said she was wearing Â£3,000 earrings that belonged to Ms Ecclestone. Ms Mester's defence barrister said she was given the items as a gift having spent a week as a ""call girl"" in December.

"The events of the past 48 hours feel like a political explosion, with Dominic Cummings now departing from Downing Street. But while it's tempting to see this is as a dramatic and sudden eruption, it has been a longer-term burn. The prime minister's chief adviser stepped back somewhat from some of the brutal day-to-day politics he had helped create after the election. He had been spending more time focusing on trying to rewire Whitehall - trying to increase the importance of science and data in government - hoping to be less involved in the moment-by-moment political rush. But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas Profile: Dominic Cummings Ex-Treasury adviser settles unfair dismissal claim Since the summer, there have been conversations about shifting some of the senior roles around to make No 10 run more smoothly - including, perhaps, a total exit for Mr Cummings or a different, more specific role. But in the Conservative Party, the adviser - who is not a Tory member, which rubs party people up the wrong way in itself - has been a lightning rod for irritation for years, and he became a focus for public rage too after he ignored lockdown rules anddrove to Durham. As the government's handling of the pandemic came under increasing attack, MPs became more convinced day-by-day that there needed to be change in No 10 - with Mr Cummings at the top of the list - and they grew more determined in making that case to Boris Johnson. Even those who reviled the PM's most senior adviser would acknowledge his strategy - forcing conflicts to win and drawing sharp divides between Leavers and Remainers - was effective. But as soon as the prime minister had his general election majority, there were concerns that the campaigning style was just too toxic to run a Downing Street operation with different pressures. Campaigns have to win, governments have to lead and persuade. What's burst into the open this week, with all the bitter briefings, is an acceleration of a change that was already coming. But what it won't change is the personality of the one person, the prime minister, who is meant to be in charge. Dominic Cummings' many foes absolve the PM of responsibility if they pin all the mistakes and mess on him. It's up to Boris Johnson now to build a new and more stable team, and shape what happens next.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Level 4 'under consideration' in the west Areas in the west of Scotland have been warned they may be placed under the highest level of Covid restrictions next week. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said contact had been made with councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas. They were told it was possible that restrictions may need to be increased from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. A Scottish retail trade association said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the prospect of shops having to shut during the festive season. The Scottish government confirmed on Friday evening it had made contact with every council in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area - in most cases at chief executive level - to discuss the current situation. The chief executives of both North and South Lanarkshire Councils were also called. A spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government officials make regular contact with all local authorities to discuss plans for protection measures before these are finalised."" Mr Swinney said increases in Covid cases had also been seen in other areas, including Stirling, which is also currently in level three, and Aberdeenshire, which is in level two. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Fife, Perth & Kinross and Angus move into level 3 He said the national incident management team would be looking at the data over the weekend. Discussions will also take place with councils before ministers meet on Tuesday to take any decisions. Mr Swinney added that there were ""wider issues"" which would also need to be considered, such as the social and economic harm which could be caused by moving an area into level four. The highest level of coronavirus restrictions is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. The guidelines say it will only be used if ""absolutely necessary"", at a time when cases are very high and there is a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. In response to the announcement, Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, called for the implementation of blended learning in areas which move into level four, amid concerns about school safety. The union said the growing number of pupils and teachers infected with Covid-19 raised issues over the effectiveness of virus mitigations in schools. The Scottish Retail Consortium said jobs would be lost if shops cannot trade during the festive season, which many rely on to boost winter sales. Director David Lonsdale said: ""It's already been an especially gloomy year for retail - but shop closures prior to Christmas would take us even deeper into the darkness."" Several councils confirmed they were in talks over the level 4 move. A spokesperson for North Lanarkshire said:  ""The council continues to engage with the Scottish government on the most appropriate level for North Lanarkshire to be in and we are actively encouraging residents to continue to comply with national guidance."" South Lanarkshire said it was in ""constructive dialogue"" with the Scottish government and East Renfrewshire also said discussions were continuing. The EIS union has called for the re-introduction of blended learning in level 4 areas A Renfrewshire Council spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government have contacted us, and we are in discussion with them. No decision has been taken and Renfrewshire remains in level three at present. ""The council is committed to doing everything possible to help keep Renfrewshire communities out of further restrictions and local businesses open. We are asking all of Renfrewshire to work together to stop transmission of this virus, keep our communities safe and protect local jobs."" At the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Swinney said: ""I can confirm that officials in the Scottish government have been in contact with a number of local authorities in the west of Scotland about the possibility of the area having to be increased from level three to level four. He added that a number of other local authorities around the country had been contacted because they had seen ""quite significant"" increases in rates of the virus. Mr Swinney added that the numbers were ""so stubbornly high"" in some level three areas that it raised a question of whether the restrictions were doing enough to suppress the virus. Mr Swinney added that if any area was moved into level four, this would need to be for ""a reasonable amount of time"" so that the effect of the restrictions could be seen.

"Dominic Cummings arriving at Downing Street on Friday Boris Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings is expected to leave his position by the end of the year. Mr Cummings told the BBC ""rumours of me threatening to resign are invented"", after speculation this week. But he added that his ""position hasn't changed since my January blog"" when he said thathe wanted to make himself ""largely redundant"" by the end of 2020. And a senior Downing Street source said that Mr Cummings would be ""out of government"" by Christmas. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was no question the announcement of his departure was ""accelerated by turmoil in No 10 in recent days"". It comes afterLee Cain - the director of communications and an ally of Mr Cummings - stood downamid reports of internal tensions at Downing Street. The pair are long-time colleagues, having worked together on the Leave campaign during the EU referendum - and Mr Cain's departure prompted rumours that his ally would also step down. Meanwhile, former Treasury adviser Sonia Khan, sacked after Mr Cummings accused her of leaking from inside Downing Street, hassettled her unfair dismissal claim with the government. Kuenssberg: Is Cummings' departure a blessing or an error? Is Vote Leave losing its muscle in Downing Street? Speaking to the BBC's political editor, Mr Cummings denied that he had threatened to resign after Mr Cain's departure - and instead pointed out that he had indicated his own plans nearly a year ago. While it's tempting to see this is as a dramatic and sudden eruption, it has been a longer-term burn. The prime minister's chief adviser stepped back somewhat from some of the brutal day-to-day politics he had helped create after the election. He had been spending more time focusing on trying to rewire Whitehall - trying to increase the importance of science and data in government - hoping to be less involved in the moment-by-moment political rush. But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Read more from Laura After Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, he hired Mr Cummings to be his senior adviser, and six months later the pair's strategy of stressing ""Get Brexit Done"" as the main campaign message helped the party win a large majority in the general election. Mr Cummings has become more of a public figure in the past year and was forced into holding his own news conference at Downing Street in the summer, followingcontroversy over him making a trip to the north of Englandwhen non-essential travel was banned at the height of the coronavirus lockdown. Dominic Cummings, 48, ran the pro-Brexit Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum and was behind the group's ""take back control"" slogan Prior to the referendum he worked for Iain Duncan Smith when he was Conservative Party leader and Michael Gove at the Department for Education Born in Durham, Mr Cummings went to a state primary school before being privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history A longstanding Eurosceptic, he cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group and once ran a successful campaign to oppose a regionally elected assembly in north-east England He was portrayed by actor Benedict Cumberbatch in the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War Profile: Dominic Cummings Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he was ""not particularly surprised"" by the announcement, adding that ""advisers come and go over a period of time"". Asked if his departure of Mr Cummings and Mr Cain suggested the prime minister was intending to follow a very different path, Mr Shapps said Mr Johnson had ""always taken advice from a very wide range of people and doesn't always side with the same people at the end of that decision-making process"". Tory MP Theresa Villiers - who was in cabinet until February - said the chief adviser's exit offered ""an opportunity for a fresh start"" and a ""more collegiate"" approach from No 10. She told BBC News: ""There is no doubt that both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers, and on some occasion ministers and secretaries of states as well, and I don't think that was helpful. ""I do think it is important whoever takes over from these two has a different approach."" Writing in his blog in January 2020,externalto encourage ""weirdos"" to work in No 10, Mr Cummings said he wanted to ""improve performance"" in government  in order to ""make me less important - and within a year largely redundant"". Since taking his job at Number 10, he has not been a popular figure with everyone within the governing party, and was known for making disparaging comments about some of Mr Johnson's own MPs, including labelling Brexiteer MPs ""useful idiots"". This video can not be played How powerful is Dominic Cummings? It was widely suggested that former Conservative leader Sir John Major was talking about Mr Cummings when he warned Mr Johnson in a speech in September 2019 not to rely on ""overmighty advisers"". Sir John, who led the country from 1990 to 1997, added: ""I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair.

"The events of the past 48 hours feel like a political explosion, with Dominic Cummings now departing from Downing Street. But while it's tempting to see this is as a dramatic and sudden eruption, it has been a longer-term burn. The prime minister's chief adviser stepped back somewhat from some of the brutal day-to-day politics he had helped create after the election. He had been spending more time focusing on trying to rewire Whitehall - trying to increase the importance of science and data in government - hoping to be less involved in the moment-by-moment political rush. But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas Profile: Dominic Cummings Ex-Treasury adviser settles unfair dismissal claim Since the summer, there have been conversations about shifting some of the senior roles around to make No 10 run more smoothly - including, perhaps, a total exit for Mr Cummings or a different, more specific role. But in the Conservative Party, the adviser - who is not a Tory member, which rubs party people up the wrong way in itself - has been a lightning rod for irritation for years, and he became a focus for public rage too after he ignored lockdown rules anddrove to Durham. As the government's handling of the pandemic came under increasing attack, MPs became more convinced day-by-day that there needed to be change in No 10 - with Mr Cummings at the top of the list - and they grew more determined in making that case to Boris Johnson. Even those who reviled the PM's most senior adviser would acknowledge his strategy - forcing conflicts to win and drawing sharp divides between Leavers and Remainers - was effective. But as soon as the prime minister had his general election majority, there were concerns that the campaigning style was just too toxic to run a Downing Street operation with different pressures. Campaigns have to win, governments have to lead and persuade. What's burst into the open this week, with all the bitter briefings, is an acceleration of a change that was already coming. But what it won't change is the personality of the one person, the prime minister, who is meant to be in charge. Dominic Cummings' many foes absolve the PM of responsibility if they pin all the mistakes and mess on him. It's up to Boris Johnson now to build a new and more stable team, and shape what happens next.

"Waiting for the actual exam results is the fairest way of allocating places, say experts Universities in England are to switch to offering degree places on the basis of actual grades rather than predicted ones, the government has announced. In an interview with BBC Education Editor Branwen Jeffreys, Gavin Williamson said the present system held bright but disadvantaged pupils back. He said he wanted all students to be able to choose the best university they can go to once they know their grades. Universities have just backed such a change following a review. Currently, pupils are offered places from universities ahead of their results, so decisions are based on predictions made by their teachers. Universities may ditch predicted grades on offers University applications could be after A-levels Once A-level, BTEC and other exam results are issued in August, candidates then accept or refuse offers they have received. A consultation will be carried out but it is expected the change to what is known as a post-qualification admissions system will take place before the next general election. The current system relies heavily on predicted grades which puts academically high achieving pupils from poorer areas at a disadvantage. Research this year from University College London,externalfound 23% of pupils from comprehensives were under-predicted by two or more grades, compared to just 11% of grammar and private school pupils. But there are still big questions about how this would work, with universities favouring a system in which students would still apply before exams but receive offers afterwards. Others may push for the more radical option of both applications and offers being made after results, pushing the start of term back to January for first year students. This video can not be played Education Secretary Gavin Williamson: ""I want to smash through these ceilings"" Mr Williamson told the BBC: ""I want all students to look at the grades they've got and then see what is the best university that they can get to, what is the best course they can do. ""I want to smash through these ceilings that are preventing them from meeting their full potential."" He said pupils from less-affluent, non-traditional backgrounds often did not have to the confidence to aim for a highly selective university, and also often lacked advice about how to reach such goals. The move comes after years of debate over post-qualification admissions. Numerous academic studies suggest pupils from working class backgrounds, and some ethnic groups, tend to be predicted lower grades by their teachers. The university admissions system was brought into sharp focus in the summer, when exam results were cancelled, leading to thousands of students losing the places they thought they had not qualified for. Universities promised to offer as many places as they could if candidates received the grades they needed after results were re-issued. Mr Williamson said the use of predicted grades limited ""the aspirations of students before they know what they can achieve"". ""We need to radically change a system which breeds low aspiration and unfairness,"" he added. ""We're going to deliver this before next election, we're going to do an extensive consultation. ""But there's a real determination what we've seen in this pandemic, we've seen great challenges that society has had to deal with and as we move out of this pandemic we need to build back better."" Mr Williamson also criticised universities which offer inducements or conditional unconditional offers to some students to lure them on to their courses. ""What we've seen over the last few years is what I describe as a little bit of sharp practice where universities have been offering unconditional offers, more and more and creating incentives, in terms of offering laptops or cash back to those students, and that means those students aren't choosing the  course and the university that is best to meet their future potential. ""We want to move away from that."" The plan has received a warm welcome from vice-chancellors' organisation, Universities UK, who had resolved to move to post qualification admissions following an 18-months review. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""The current system is based on inaccurately predicted results and leads to those from less-affluent backgrounds losing out. ""Allowing students to apply after they receive their results will help level the playing field and put a stop to the chaotic clearing scramble."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Teachers work hard and diligently to provide accurate predicted grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. He agreed: ""Post-qualification admissions would be better and fairer.""

"New cases in England have stabilised around 50,000 a day, the ONS estimates Friday's daily government figures show 27,301 new infections and 376 deaths in the UK UK R rate falls to between 1 and 1.2 - meaning the epidemic is slowing but still growing People celebrating Diwali this weekend urged to stick to lockdown rules and only meet others online Several European countries warn it's too early to say if people will be able to travel at Christmas Caffe Nero seeks help as Covid 'decimates' sales Tesco brings in online queuing system amid early Christmas delivery rush PHE report finds people with learning difficulties at six-fold risk of dying from Covid-19 Edited by Martha Buckley and Emily Young Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest coronavirus updates. The live page has been edited by Emily Young and Martha Buckley, and written by Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. And here are the latest headlines from around the
world today: We are preparing to close the live page shortly. Here's a reminder of some of the top stories in the UK today: Tulip MazumdarGlobal Health Correspondent Concerns around vaccines is nothing new. But the speed at which Covid-19 candidates are being developed, have made some people - understandably - question how it's possible to make a safe and effective vaccine so fast. It usually takes around a decade to develop a new vaccine, but in less than a year it appears scientists have created at least one for Covid. So how are they doing it? Firstly, they are well-funded - and time is money. Governments around the world, desperate for a way out of this crisis, have ploughed billions of dollars into developing a vaccine. This is unprecedented in such a short space of time. It can take scientists years just to secure funding for their research for other vaccines. With so many people potentially receiving a vaccine, safety has to be the absolute number one priority. There is a very robust international human trials process which establishes the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. The World Health Organization - which is collating all the data from trials for more than 200 vaccine candidates - says safety data cannot and will not be compromised. Studies will also continue even after vaccines are rolled out to keep track of any rare possible side effects. Also, much of what needs to happen to get a successful vaccine out to people all over the world is already under way. For example, hundreds of millions of the most promising vaccine candidates are already being manufactured. This usually only happens when a vaccine is approved for wide use. If the vaccines are found not to be effective or safe enough as trial data continues coming in, they won't be used. But if any of them are - the vaccines will be ready to deploy very quickly.

weekend's France v Fiji Six Nations rugby match has been called off after a number of the Fijian players tested
positive for Covid. Ben Morel, CEO of the Six Nations,said
it was impossible for the Fijian team to field a competitive team,external. Fiji's match against Portugal was already cancelled after three of their players tested positive. They are due to play Italy and Scotland next
weekend. Further tests will be taken in the coming days. We told you earlier about criticism of fans' behaviour in an Aberdeen pub after Scotland's win over Serbia last night. Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland have now launched an investigation after footage posted online showed people at the Draft Project pop-up bar embracing while celebrating the result. The owner of the bar has now spoken, saying staff were ""unable to prevent or contain what happened"". Stuart Clarkson, owner and founder of PB Devco, which owns the bar, said: ""Having seen the videos I am shocked, disappointed and saddened. ""This simply is not acceptable and I understand why people are so upset by this.""While we are proud of our venues and the safe environment they provide, it is clear that in this case we misjudged what was likely to happen. ""Despite having four additional members of security staff on duty, we were simply unable to contain the outbreak of joy at Scotland's success."" Aberdeen is currently in Level 2 of coronavirus restrictions and rules state no more than two households can mix in pubs. Police said there were no arrests or fixed penalty notices issued in relation to the alleged incident. Read more here. Italy has reported a record 40,902 coronavirus
cases over the past 24 hours and 550 deaths. Earlier this week, the country became the third
nation in mainland Europe to surpass one million cases, after Spain and France. There have been calls for a national lockdown
to help curb the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the worst affected countries
in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic. More than 43,000 people have died there since the
pandemic began. California has become the second US state to
hit one million cases. Texas was the first state to hit the landmark
figure. Both states now have more viral caseloads than countries including
Mexico and Germany. The US reported a record high of 153,496 new
infections on Thursday as well as 919 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins
University. Over 67,000 people are currently in hospital in
the US. Eleven counties in California have been told to
reverse some opening measures. The stateâs positivity rate â the percentage of
positive tests in the population - is now at 3.6%. California Governor Gavin Newsom urged people
to wear masks and distance. âYour actions could literally save lives,â he
said. Read more about the

Gordon Howat had been in France for the 1998 World Cup, the last major tournament Scotland have competed in. And when the team won on penalties at the Rajko Mitic stadium, he was there too - having been a pitch consultant for Red Star Belgrade since 2017. He joked: ""Sometimes you have to call in a favour and arrange a visit at the right time."" Mr Howat was spotted in the main stand with his saltire by BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin before the match. Mr Howat told him: ""I was lucky enough to be in France for the Brazil game 20-odd years ago. ""It was a great moment. I guess it was just myself and a few guys, like yourself, in the press. ""I'm sure it was big back home in Scotland, despite lockdown."" There have been 27,301 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK, according to thedaily figures released by the government,external. It brings the total - since the pandemic began - to 1,317,496. There have been a further 376 deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. It means 51,304 people have now died, under this measure.  This video can not be played Birmingham care home reunites couple separated by Covid A devoted couple who have been married for 71 years have been reunited in a care home after five weeks apart. Ken Meredith, who has dementia, has been living at Bourn View Care Home in Birmingham for five weeks. His wife Betty was unable to visit him due to the coronavirus pandemic - so decided to move in, so they could be together, without telling her husband. After self-isolating for two weeks, she was allowed to be reunited with him, and the pair were treated to a romantic dinner by care home staff. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The scientists advising the government believe the R number for the UK is between 1 and 1.2, slightly down on last weekâs 1.1-1.3. The worst case, an R of 1.2, means that the epidemic is doubling roughly every four weeks. When the epidemic had been doubling fortnightly through much of the autumn, slower growth is better news. But itâs still growth. The best case, an R of 1, means no growth. That would mean a continuation of about 50,000 cases a day in England, more across the UK, and just over 2,000 coronavirus deaths a week. It is possible that it may be below 1 in the north west of England, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scientists advising the government say we need the epidemic to shrink - for R to be below 1, consistently, before the pressure on hospitals starts to ease. The Australian prime minister said President-elect Joe Biden was ""very interested"" in how Australia has handled the pandemic US President-elect Joe Biden has invited Australia to share its findings about
containing the spread of Coronavirus, according to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The
pair spoke over the phone on Thursday,external, SBS News reports. Mr Morrison told reporters he would be
sending a copy of the National Contact Tracing review to the Biden team as well
as to President Trump. The Australian prime-minister said Mr Biden was
âvery interested in Australiaâs successâ. Australia shut its borders early on into the pandemic and introduced strict measures. The country has recorded more than 27,600 cases and 907 deaths in a country of more than 24 million people. During the election campaign, Mr Biden said he
would âlisten to the scienceâ when it came to tackling the pandemic in the US. The US has recorded 10.5 million cases and more
than 242,000 deaths since the outbreak began. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Microsoft says it has detectedcyber-attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting seven companies involved in researching vaccines,externaland treatments for Covid-19. The companyâs vice-president, Tom Burt, said in a blog post that the targets included leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from one group in Russia and two in North Korea. The ""majority"" of these attacks were said to have been blocked and the companies informed. It is not the first time that states have been accused of targeting vaccine work. In July, the UK saidRussian intelligence was behind the targeting of UK research, including on the Oxford vaccine.The US also accused China of similar activity. All of this is part of a global race for a vaccine as countries seek advantage over each other. Footballer Mo Salah has contracted the virus,
according to the Egyptian Football Association (EFA). A tweet from the association said the Liverpool
starhad
tested positive,externalbut was not suffering from any symptoms. The Egyptian national team are preparing for their African Cup of

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thousands of live sheep have been travelling from Mongolia to China since late October Some 1,800 live sheep are today arriving in China today from Mongolia, and will begin the roughly 1,000 mile journey to Wuhan - the city where the coronavirus was first detected. They are the final batch of 30,000 donated to China by Mongoliaâs president, Khaltmaa Battulga, during a visit there in late February, when Wuhan was hard-hit by the virus. It was also in strict lockdown, with residents unable to leave the city, or even their buildings, without special permission. The sheep have been travelling in batches since late October. The official China Daily newspaper says sheep are a âsymbol of wealth and status in Mongoliaâ and that the gift representsâthe best wishes of the Mongolian peopleâ,external. Wuhan was the Chinese city worst hit by the coronavirus. More than 50,000 of the city's 11 million population contracted Covid-10, and some 3,800 people died. It also experiencedheavy flooding during the summer,external, impacting the agricultural sector and leading to fears about winter food shortages. The city is, however, Covid-free now and this week hosted an international health expo,which attracted some 13,000 guests from 34 countries and regions.,external The ad features a cast of characters that includes this pigeon gang The annualJohn Lewis Christmas adhas been revealed - with the boss of the shopping chain saying it wanted something ""appropriate for how we're all feeling at the moment"". It focuses on acts of kindness, inspired by the public spirit shown throughout the pandemic and shows different characters helping other people, with a love heart as a central theme throughout. ""We wanted to have a message out there about thinking of others and helping families in need and people in need,"" John Lewis's Pippa Wicks said. Other big brands have also released their adverts. Coco-Cola and Aldi's ads show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home.   YouTubewon't be producing its annual Rewind video, looking back at the previous 12 months, this year. It said in a statement: ""2020 has been different. And it doesn't feel right to carry on as if it weren't."" YouTube has produced a retrospective every year since 2010, featuring big names looking back at some of the year's viral moments. Some have been better received than others however, with the2018 video becoming the most-disliked videoon the platform. And then last year, the format of Rewind was changed, with a compilation of the most-liked videos from 2019 instead. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, who writes about YouTube and other social platforms, said it was a shame that Rewind had been cancelled because YouTube had become ""a major source of entertainment and support for people during the pandemic"". But he added: ""There's just not that much new that's come out of YouTube this year. It's been outmoded and overtaken as the place that trends begin, by more nimble apps like TikTok."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The figures from the Office for National Statistics today suggest that infections were stabilising in thefirst week of November. Yesterdayâs figures showed a sharp rise in people testing positivein the middle of this week. So if there is a sharp rise in infections towards the end of last week or early this week, we wouldnât see it in the surveysuntil next Friday. Butone dayâssharp jump doesnât establish a trend, so weâll have to wait for a few more days to know for sure. There are two main long term trends in the data on the virus, and the ONS figures fit into that picture. In the places or people where the virus has risen furthest, places like Northern Ireland, the north west of England or among teenagers and young adults, infections appear to be stabilising or even falling. But it is still rising where it has, to date, made fewer inroads. That is in places like the south of England or in those over the age of 70 who are most likely to become seriously sick. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year A people smuggler has told a jury a lorry driver phoned him to say: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Gheorge Nica, 43, denies any role in the deaths of the Vietnamese nationals, who were found in Grays, Essex, on 23 October 2019, the Old Bailey has heard. He admits some people-smuggling crimes, but said he had been unaware any migrants were in the trailer in Grays. Mr Nica described the moment he knew things had gone ""very, very bad"". The migrants, aged 15 to 44, suffocated in a sealed trailer en route from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet, Essex. Mr Nica said he called driver Maurice Robinson at 01:00, having agreed for him to park the lorry at a yard in Orsett at that time. The bodies were found when the container was opened in Essex ""I say 'Well. What's going on? Are you coming or not?',"" Mr Nica told the jury. ""And he just said 'I don't know, I don't know'. ""I said 'listen, are you OK there?' And I thought in my mind he might be stopped by police or customs."" The jury heard Mr Robinson had called Mr Nica back 10 minutes later. ""I said 'Are you still coming?' ""[He said] 'I don't know. I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Aftab Jafferjee QC, defending, asked: ""What was your reaction to that?""

"The R number for the UK has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Level 4 'under consideration' in the west Areas in the west of Scotland have been warned they may be placed under the highest level of Covid restrictions next week. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said contact had been made with councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas. They were told it was possible that restrictions may need to be increased from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. A Scottish retail trade association said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the prospect of shops having to shut during the festive season. The Scottish government confirmed on Friday evening it had made contact with every council in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area - in most cases at chief executive level - to discuss the current situation. The chief executives of both North and South Lanarkshire Councils were also called. A spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government officials make regular contact with all local authorities to discuss plans for protection measures before these are finalised."" Mr Swinney said increases in Covid cases had also been seen in other areas, including Stirling, which is also currently in level three, and Aberdeenshire, which is in level two. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Fife, Perth & Kinross and Angus move into level 3 He said the national incident management team would be looking at the data over the weekend. Discussions will also take place with councils before ministers meet on Tuesday to take any decisions. Mr Swinney added that there were ""wider issues"" which would also need to be considered, such as the social and economic harm which could be caused by moving an area into level four. The highest level of coronavirus restrictions is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. The guidelines say it will only be used if ""absolutely necessary"", at a time when cases are very high and there is a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. In response to the announcement, Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, called for the implementation of blended learning in areas which move into level four, amid concerns about school safety. The union said the growing number of pupils and teachers infected with Covid-19 raised issues over the effectiveness of virus mitigations in schools. The Scottish Retail Consortium said jobs would be lost if shops cannot trade during the festive season, which many rely on to boost winter sales. Director David Lonsdale said: ""It's already been an especially gloomy year for retail - but shop closures prior to Christmas would take us even deeper into the darkness."" Several councils confirmed they were in talks over the level 4 move. A spokesperson for North Lanarkshire said:  ""The council continues to engage with the Scottish government on the most appropriate level for North Lanarkshire to be in and we are actively encouraging residents to continue to comply with national guidance."" South Lanarkshire said it was in ""constructive dialogue"" with the Scottish government and East Renfrewshire also said discussions were continuing. The EIS union has called for the re-introduction of blended learning in level 4 areas A Renfrewshire Council spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government have contacted us, and we are in discussion with them. No decision has been taken and Renfrewshire remains in level three at present. ""The council is committed to doing everything possible to help keep Renfrewshire communities out of further restrictions and local businesses open. We are asking all of Renfrewshire to work together to stop transmission of this virus, keep our communities safe and protect local jobs."" At the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Swinney said: ""I can confirm that officials in the Scottish government have been in contact with a number of local authorities in the west of Scotland about the possibility of the area having to be increased from level three to level four. He added that a number of other local authorities around the country had been contacted because they had seen ""quite significant"" increases in rates of the virus. Mr Swinney added that the numbers were ""so stubbornly high"" in some level three areas that it raised a question of whether the restrictions were doing enough to suppress the virus. Mr Swinney added that if any area was moved into level four, this would need to be for ""a reasonable amount of time"" so that the effect of the restrictions could be seen.

"The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year A people smuggler has told a jury a lorry driver phoned him to say: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Gheorge Nica, 43, denies any role in the deaths of the Vietnamese nationals, who were found in Grays, Essex, on 23 October 2019, the Old Bailey has heard. He admits some people-smuggling crimes, but said he had been unaware any migrants were in the trailer in Grays. Mr Nica described the moment he knew things had gone ""very, very bad"". The migrants, aged 15 to 44, suffocated in a sealed trailer en route from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet, Essex. Mr Nica said he called driver Maurice Robinson at 01:00, having agreed for him to park the lorry at a yard in Orsett at that time. The bodies were found when the container was opened in Essex ""I say 'Well. What's going on? Are you coming or not?',"" Mr Nica told the jury. ""And he just said 'I don't know, I don't know'. ""I said 'listen, are you OK there?' And I thought in my mind he might be stopped by police or customs."" The jury heard Mr Robinson had called Mr Nica back 10 minutes later. ""I said 'Are you still coming?' ""[He said] 'I don't know. I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Aftab Jafferjee QC, defending, asked: ""What was your reaction to that?"" Mr Nica replied: ""I said 'listen, what do you mean dead bodies?' ""He said 'yeah, there are too many'. I said 'ring the ambulance, ring the police, do not move at all'."" On what he did next, Nica said: ""I was sitting in the car and it was still very, very bad."" The next day, he travelled to Romania because he was ""scared"" of a ""big, big investigation"". He had been involved in previous smuggling and had made phone calls regarding the fatal shipment. Under cross-examination, prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said Mr Nica's version of events was ""ridiculous"". He said: ""You said 'everyone trying to escape from this situation is just telling stories'. ""You have here in one sentence exactly described your own situation."" Mr Nica, of Basildon, and lorry driver Eamonn Harrison, 23, of County Down, deny 39 counts of manslaughter. Irish haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and Mr Robinson, 26, have previously admitted manslaughter. Mr Harrison, lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, have denied being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy, which Mr Nica has admitted he was involved in.

"Almost 23 million people watched Martin Bashir's Panorama interview with Princess Diana in 1995 A previously missing note from Princess Diana, thought to indicate she was happy with the way her interview by BBC Panorama was obtained, has been found. The BBC said it had recovered the ""original handwritten note"" that the princess wrote following the Panorama interview of November 1995. The broadcaster said it would hand over the note to an independent inquiry. The probe will look at claims made by Diana's brother about how BBC reporter Martin Bashir secured the interview. Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor, is recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 and has been unable to comment on Charles Spencer's allegations. Earl Spencer called for an independent inquiry earlier this month and said he would never have introduced Bashir to his sister if he had not seen the faked bank statements. The faked statements wrongly purported to show that the earl's former head of security had been paid by a newspaper group and a mysterious offshore company. The BBC has apologised for the faked bank statements, but it says the note from the princess says she did not see them and insisted they played ""no part in her decision to take part in the interview"". The BBC's not saying how the letter came back into its possession - but it clearly hopes it will help its case when the independent investigation looks into the allegations made by Earl Spencer. The letter is believed to say that Diana was not influenced by the forged bank statements Martin Bashir had made - and was happy with the way the interview was secured. If the princess was unaware of or untroubled by the forgeries, or the alleged deceit, it will help the BBC's defence: it says the original investigation was into whether the princess had been misled into giving the interview. A note from her saying she hadn't would clearly weigh heavily. But the note does not address Earl Spencer's central allegation. He alleges that the forged documents were part of a series of lies he was told by Bashir, lies that were meant to win his trust and thus gain access to Diana. What we know of the rediscovered note from Diana doesn't address the serious allegations of journalistic misconduct Earl Spencer has made. Nor does it help resolve the question of how much the BBC knew back in 1996 when it said the forgeries played no part in securing the interview. Nearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded almost 25 years ago, on 20 November 1995. The interview made headlines when the princess said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. Earlier this monththe Daily Mail published notes Earl Spencer says he made,externalwith Bashir two months before the interview. 'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade Diana's brother demands BBC inquiry over interview BBC's Martin Bashir 'seriously unwell' from Covid Our correspondent Jonny Dymond said the notes appeared to record Bashir ""spinning lie after lie about members of the Royal Family, and its staff, in an attempt, Earl Spencer says, to win his trust and that of his sister"". These claims, described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"", include that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped. It was also claimed that her bodyguard was plotting against her and close friends were betraying her by leaking stories to the press. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in a Paris underpass.

"Corrie Mckeague went missing after a night out in September 2016 An airman who went missing four years ago is thought to have died after he climbed into an industrial waste bin, an inquest heard. Corrie Mckeague, 23, who was based at RAF Honington, Suffolk, is believed to have died on 24 September 2016 after a night out in Bury St Edmunds. Despite extensive searches, his body has never been found. The inquest was opened at Suffolk Coroner's Court and was adjourned for a pre-inquest review in February. Ch Supt Marina Ericson from Suffolk Police said Mr Mckeague had been on a night out in Bury St Edmunds and was ""very drunk"" when he was asked to leave the Flex nightclub. She said Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was ""happy and friendly throughout the night"" and was last seen alive at 03:25 BST walking into a horseshoe-shaped area behind Greggs and Superdrug, where industrial waste bins were stored. Ch Supt Marina Ericson said Mr Mckeague was believed to have climbed into a bin A Biffa refuse lorry drove into the area less than an hour after the last sighting of Mr Mckeague. The lorry's load weighed 116kg, 70 to 80kg more than average, she told the hearing in Ipswich. The airman's mobile phone mapped the same route as the bin lorry to Barton Mills, she said. Ch Supt Ericson said it was believed Mr Mckeague had climbed into the Greggs waste bin and was inside it when it was emptied into the Biffa lorry. ""That was where he subsequently died,"" she said. A landfill site was extensively searched as part of the investigation The chief coroner for England and Walesdirected the inquest be held into the death, following a request from Mr Mckeague's family. Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, previously said she hoped the inquest would ""be able to tell me, and us as a family, that there is just nothing else that we could do or be able to do to find Corrie"". The mystery of the airman who disappeared Missing Corrie search to be stood down Missing airman search costs police Â£2.1m The Suffolk Police investigation into the disappearance was handed to the cold case team in 2018. At the time, the force said the evidence pointed to Mr Mckeague having been ""transported from the 'horseshoe' area in a bin lorry and ultimately taken to the Milton landfill site"". As part of the inquiry, which cost more than Â£2m, police trawled the landfill site in Cambridgeshire. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"About 4,000 people are empolyed at the Tata Steel plant in Port Talbot Tata Steel has announced plans to make its UK business, based mainly in Port Talbot, ""self-sustaining"" while selling its Netherlands-based operations. Tata Steel said it planned to sell the European arm of its business and keep the UK business running without financial support from India. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news was ""extremely worrying"" for Tata's 8,000 UK workers. Tata said it was speaking to the UK government about the business's future. The UK government said: ""This is a commercial decision forÂ Tata Steel. We will continue to work withÂ Tata Steel and other stakeholders as the company shapes its business strategy for the future.Â Â ""The UK governmentÂ remains committed to supporting a sustainable, long-term future for steel making in the UK.""Â Tata said it is ""reviewing options"" to make its UK business run without funding support from India The India-based business announced Swedish steel firm SSAB had initiated talks about the acquisition of its business in the Netherlands, including its steelworks at Ijmuiden, north-west of Amsterdam. Tata said it plans to separate the UK and Netherlands arms of the business and ""will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and UK business in the future"". It added: ""Tata Steel continues its dialogue with the UK government on potential measures to safeguard the long-term future of Tata Steel UK and is also reviewing all options to make the business self-sustaining without the need for any funding support from Tata Steel India in the future."" About half of Tata's 8,000 UK workers are based at Port Talbot, with several other sites around Wales and the rest of the UK. 'Thousands' of jobs fears over reported Tata plans Tata Steel in government talks amid bailout reports T V Narendran, CEO and managing director of Tata, said: ""We are continuing our discussions with the UK government regarding the future strategy of our UK business."" Mr Skates said: ""Today's announcement will be extremely worrying for Tata Steel workers across Wales, their families, local communities and the supply chain, but we know the steel industry has a future in Wales and the UK. ""The first minister and I spoke with Tata today and they said they are determined to find a sustainable future for operations in the UK and to safeguard the 8,000 workforce, most of which are in Wales. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates said the news would be ""extremely worrying"" for steelworkers ""The first minister is seeking urgent talks with the prime minister and I will speak to the secretary of state for BEIS (business, energy and industrial strategy) and the secretary of state for Wales to call for urgent action. ""The industry is now waiting for the UK government to take immediate action to safeguard the sector and protect jobs. Every day they are not at the table is another day lost for workers and for an industry of strategic importance."" Concerns have been issued over Tata's future several times in recent years, withAberavon MP Stephen Kinnock saying in July that a plan to shut off two blast furnaces and replace them with electric arch furnacesraised ""massive questions"" about the future of the industry. He also said the company wouldneed a Â£500m bailout to get through the coronavirus pandemic. David Rees, the Labour MS for Aberavon, said in atweet,external: ""Once again our steelworkers are facing challenging times following this news. Almost five years ago they and their families went through hell as their livelihoods came under threat with the then announcement of a proposed sale of the Tata steel plants in Wales ""Today, those concerns have been resurrected with the announcement that Tata Steel Europe is likely to be split with the Dutch components being sold to Swedish steelmaker SSAB leaving the UK element to stand alone.""

Steel industry analyst Dr Kathryn Ringwald-Wildman said she was ""not surprised"" by Tata's announcement. She said: ""The company has made no secret of the fact it's wanted to offload the European side of the business. ""Previous negotiations have fallen through and we've had the pandemic which has depressed the market. ""It's made things difficult for automotive industry - which is a major steel customer - and there's still uncertainty in the future."" Tony Brady, from the Unite union, said it was ""essential"" that Tata is able to keep trading with the EU after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. He said: ""Today's news effectively means that Tata's European steel business will now be based solely in the UK. ""With Brexit fast approaching it is essential that Tata's UK steel business is able to continue trading effectively across the European Union. ""This means that it is crucial that the UK comes to a trade agreement with the EU in the coming weeks. The UK government have told us that Brexit will be good for Britain and British jobs, they must deliver on that promise."" Meanwhile, Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community Union, said Tata must now ""reaffirm their commitment to the UK"". He said: ""We will challenge Tata at every turn and rest assured we will protect our members' interests. Should we conclude the separation of Tata Steel UK would place our members' livelihoods at risk then we will vigorously oppose the break-up of the company. ""There is no doubt a sustainable future for Tata Steel UK depends on Tata and the government concluding a deal that will support the transition to low-carbon steelmaking. He added: ""There are many challenges ahead but we know Tata Steel UK can have a bright future. ""We take confidence from the fact our steelworkers are the best in the world. Under the right leadership, given the right tools, and the chance to compete on a level playing field, we back ourselves to compete with the world's best.""

"This video can not be played The only Scotland fan in the stadium for victory over Serbia Gordon Howat was among thousands of Tartan Army foot soldiers who travelled to France for the 1998 World Cup - the last time the men's team took part in a major tournament. But 22 years later he was the only Scotland supporter in the Rajko Mitic stadium as victory over Serbia saw the national side book its place in next year's European Championships. Mr Howat, from Helensburgh in Argyll and Bute, has been a pitch consultant for Red Star Belgrade - who play in the stadium - since 2017. He joked: ""Sometimes you have to call in a favour and arrange a visit at the right time."" Mr Howat was spotted in the main stand with his saltire by BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin before the match. Scotland celebrates Euro finals qualification Why disco hit is now Scotland's unofficial anthem They met up again on Friday morning to reflect on an unforgettable night. Mr Howat said the victory over Serbia had been ""a great moment"". ""I'm sure it was big back home in Scotland, despite lockdown,"" he said. BBC Scotland's Chris McLaughlin was reunited with Gordon Howat the morning after Scotland's epic win The father-of-two admitted he was ""shaky with nerves"" during the match, whichended 1-1 after extra time. He added: ""It was a massive disappointment in the 89th minute but we were fortunate to turn it around. ""I think if nothing else, the law of averages was on our side last night and we were due a little bit of luck."" Mr Howat's memory of the thrilling finale mirrors the clip that rapidly became a social media sensation. He said: ""The thing I noticed was that David Marshall was clearly looking at the referee to make sure he had made a fair save, but it was bedlam. ""The one thing I took was that because the stadium was so quiet you could really hear the player's enjoyment."" Scotland players celebrate after the match Mr Howat, who got so many messages his phone ran out of battery, said his post-match celebrations were tame by Tartan Army standards. He added: ""I had a couple of drinks in the stadium but there's a lockdown here and the bar was closed at the hotel.""

The live page has been edited by Emily Young and Martha Buckley, and written by Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. And here are the latest headlines from around the
world today: We are preparing to close the live page shortly. Here's a reminder of some of the top stories in the UK today: Tulip MazumdarGlobal Health Correspondent Concerns around vaccines is nothing new. But the speed at which Covid-19 candidates are being developed, have made some people - understandably - question how it's possible to make a safe and effective vaccine so fast. It usually takes around a decade to develop a new vaccine, but in less than a year it appears scientists have created at least one for Covid. So how are they doing it? Firstly, they are well-funded - and time is money. Governments around the world, desperate for a way out of this crisis, have ploughed billions of dollars into developing a vaccine. This is unprecedented in such a short space of time. It can take scientists years just to secure funding for their research for other vaccines. With so many people potentially receiving a vaccine, safety has to be the absolute number one priority. There is a very robust international human trials process which establishes the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. The World Health Organization - which is collating all the data from trials for more than 200 vaccine candidates - says safety data cannot and will not be compromised. Studies will also continue even after vaccines are rolled out to keep track of any rare possible side effects. Also, much of what needs to happen to get a successful vaccine out to people all over the world is already under way. For example, hundreds of millions of the most promising vaccine candidates are already being manufactured. This usually only happens when a vaccine is approved for wide use. If the vaccines are found not to be effective or safe enough as trial data continues coming in, they won't be used. But if any of them are - the vaccines will be ready to deploy very quickly.

weekend's France v Fiji Six Nations rugby match has been called off after a number of the Fijian players tested
positive for Covid. Ben Morel, CEO of the Six Nations,said
it was impossible for the Fijian team to field a competitive team,external. Fiji's match against Portugal was already cancelled after three of their players tested positive. They are due to play Italy and Scotland next
weekend. Further tests will be taken in the coming days. We told you earlier about criticism of fans' behaviour in an Aberdeen pub after Scotland's win over Serbia last night. Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland have now launched an investigation after footage posted online showed people at the Draft Project pop-up bar embracing while celebrating the result. The owner of the bar has now spoken, saying staff were ""unable to prevent or contain what happened"". Stuart Clarkson, owner and founder of PB Devco, which owns the bar, said: ""Having seen the videos I am shocked, disappointed and saddened. ""This simply is not acceptable and I understand why people are so upset by this.""While we are proud of our venues and the safe environment they provide, it is clear that in this case we misjudged what was likely to happen. ""Despite having four additional members of security staff on duty, we were simply unable to contain the outbreak of joy at Scotland's success."" Aberdeen is currently in Level 2 of coronavirus restrictions and rules state no more than two households can mix in pubs. Police said there were no arrests or fixed penalty notices issued in relation to the alleged incident. Read more here. Italy has reported a record 40,902 coronavirus
cases over the past 24 hours and 550 deaths. Earlier this week, the country became the third
nation in mainland Europe to surpass one million cases, after Spain and France. There have been calls for a national lockdown
to help curb the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the worst affected countries
in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic. More than 43,000 people have died there since the
pandemic began. California has become the second US state to
hit one million cases. Texas was the first state to hit the landmark
figure. Both states now have more viral caseloads than countries including
Mexico and Germany. The US reported a record high of 153,496 new
infections on Thursday as well as 919 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins
University. Over 67,000 people are currently in hospital in
the US. Eleven counties in California have been told to
reverse some opening measures. The stateâs positivity rate â the percentage of
positive tests in the population - is now at 3.6%. California Governor Gavin Newsom urged people
to wear masks and distance. âYour actions could literally save lives,â he
said. Read more about the

Gordon Howat had been in France for the 1998 World Cup, the last major tournament Scotland have competed in. And when the team won on penalties at the Rajko Mitic stadium, he was there too - having been a pitch consultant for Red Star Belgrade since 2017. He joked: ""Sometimes you have to call in a favour and arrange a visit at the right time."" Mr Howat was spotted in the main stand with his saltire by BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin before the match. Mr Howat told him: ""I was lucky enough to be in France for the Brazil game 20-odd years ago. ""It was a great moment. I guess it was just myself and a few guys, like yourself, in the press. ""I'm sure it was big back home in Scotland, despite lockdown."" There have been 27,301 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK, according to thedaily figures released by the government,external. It brings the total - since the pandemic began - to 1,317,496. There have been a further 376 deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. It means 51,304 people have now died, under this measure.  This video can not be played Birmingham care home reunites couple separated by Covid A devoted couple who have been married for 71 years have been reunited in a care home after five weeks apart. Ken Meredith, who has dementia, has been living at Bourn View Care Home in Birmingham for five weeks. His wife Betty was unable to visit him due to the coronavirus pandemic - so decided to move in, so they could be together, without telling her husband. After self-isolating for two weeks, she was allowed to be reunited with him, and the pair were treated to a romantic dinner by care home staff. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The scientists advising the government believe the R number for the UK is between 1 and 1.2, slightly down on last weekâs 1.1-1.3. The worst case, an R of 1.2, means that the epidemic is doubling roughly every four weeks. When the epidemic had been doubling fortnightly through much of the autumn, slower growth is better news. But itâs still growth. The best case, an R of 1, means no growth. That would mean a continuation of about 50,000 cases a day in England, more across the UK, and just over 2,000 coronavirus deaths a week. It is possible that it may be below 1 in the north west of England, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scientists advising the government say we need the epidemic to shrink - for R to be below 1, consistently, before the pressure on hospitals starts to ease. The Australian prime minister said President-elect Joe Biden was ""very interested"" in how Australia has handled the pandemic US President-elect Joe Biden has invited Australia to share its findings about
containing the spread of Coronavirus, according to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The
pair spoke over the phone on Thursday,external, SBS News reports. Mr Morrison told reporters he would be
sending a copy of the National Contact Tracing review to the Biden team as well
as to President Trump. The Australian prime-minister said Mr Biden was
âvery interested in Australiaâs successâ. Australia shut its borders early on into the pandemic and introduced strict measures. The country has recorded more than 27,600 cases and 907 deaths in a country of more than 24 million people. During the election campaign, Mr Biden said he
would âlisten to the scienceâ when it came to tackling the pandemic in the US. The US has recorded 10.5 million cases and more
than 242,000 deaths since the outbreak began. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Microsoft says it has detectedcyber-attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting seven companies involved in researching vaccines,externaland treatments for Covid-19. The companyâs vice-president, Tom Burt, said in a blog post that the targets included leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from one group in Russia and two in North Korea. The ""majority"" of these attacks were said to have been blocked and the companies informed. It is not the first time that states have been accused of targeting vaccine work. In July, the UK saidRussian intelligence was behind the targeting of UK research, including on the Oxford vaccine.The US also accused China of similar activity. All of this is part of a global race for a vaccine as countries seek advantage over each other. Footballer Mo Salah has contracted the virus,
according to the Egyptian Football Association (EFA). A tweet from the association said the Liverpool
starhad
tested positive,externalbut was not suffering from any symptoms. The Egyptian national team are preparing for their African Cup of

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thousands of live sheep have been travelling from Mongolia to China since late October Some 1,800 live sheep are today arriving in China today from Mongolia, and will begin the roughly 1,000 mile journey to Wuhan - the city where the coronavirus was first detected. They are the final batch of 30,000 donated to China by Mongoliaâs president, Khaltmaa Battulga, during a visit there in late February, when Wuhan was hard-hit by the virus. It was also in strict lockdown, with residents unable to leave the city, or even their buildings, without special permission. The sheep have been travelling in batches since late October. The official China Daily newspaper says sheep are a âsymbol of wealth and status in Mongoliaâ and that the gift representsâthe best wishes of the Mongolian peopleâ,external. Wuhan was the Chinese city worst hit by the coronavirus. More than 50,000 of the city's 11 million population contracted Covid-10, and some 3,800 people died. It also experiencedheavy flooding during the summer,external, impacting the agricultural sector and leading to fears about winter food shortages. The city is, however, Covid-free now and this week hosted an international health expo,which attracted some 13,000 guests from 34 countries and regions.,external The ad features a cast of characters that includes this pigeon gang The annualJohn Lewis Christmas adhas been revealed - with the boss of the shopping chain saying it wanted something ""appropriate for how we're all feeling at the moment"". It focuses on acts of kindness, inspired by the public spirit shown throughout the pandemic and shows different characters helping other people, with a love heart as a central theme throughout. ""We wanted to have a message out there about thinking of others and helping families in need and people in need,"" John Lewis's Pippa Wicks said. Other big brands have also released their adverts. Coco-Cola and Aldi's ads show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home.   YouTubewon't be producing its annual Rewind video, looking back at the previous 12 months, this year. It said in a statement: ""2020 has been different. And it doesn't feel right to carry on as if it weren't."" YouTube has produced a retrospective every year since 2010, featuring big names looking back at some of the year's viral moments. Some have been better received than others however, with the2018 video becoming the most-disliked videoon the platform. And then last year, the format of Rewind was changed, with a compilation of the most-liked videos from 2019 instead. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, who writes about YouTube and other social platforms, said it was a shame that Rewind had been cancelled because YouTube had become ""a major source of entertainment and support for people during the pandemic"". But he added: ""There's just not that much new that's come out of YouTube this year. It's been outmoded and overtaken as the place that trends begin, by more nimble apps like TikTok."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The figures from the Office for National Statistics today suggest that infections were stabilising in thefirst week of November. Yesterdayâs figures showed a sharp rise in people testing positivein the middle of this week. So if there is a sharp rise in infections towards the end of last week or early this week, we wouldnât see it in the surveysuntil next Friday. Butone dayâssharp jump doesnât establish a trend, so weâll have to wait for a few more days to know for sure. There are two main long term trends in the data on the virus, and the ONS figures fit into that picture. In the places or people where the virus has risen furthest, places like Northern Ireland, the north west of England or among teenagers and young adults, infections appear to be stabilising or even falling. But it is still rising where it has, to date, made fewer inroads. That is in places like the south of England or in those over the age of 70 who are most likely to become seriously sick. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra plays Yes Sir, I Can Boogie Thousands of Scotland fans are in London ahead of their Euro 2020 match with England - but the skirl of the bagpipes has largely been drowned out by a 1970s disco classic. Videos of the Tartan Army belting out Yes Sir, I Can Boogie on the streets of the English capital have been all over social media. So how did the song become the country's unofficial national anthem? It started when a video of ecstatic players dancing to the tune went viral after Scotland clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November. The song by Spanish duo Baccara spent a single week at the top of the UK charts in 1977. But last year it got a fresh lease of life when it was used by theKeeping the Ball on the Ground podcast,externalas a tribute to defender Andrew Considine. Scotland defender Andrew Considine (centre) dressed in drag to dance to the tune on his stag do five years ago The Aberdeen cult hero - who was called up to the Scotland team for the first time last year at the age of 33 - famously starred in a spoof video of the song on his stag do. The player was unrecognisable as hedressed in dragto strut his stuff to the tune alongside friends and his father, with the professionally-produced video being played on his wedding day in 2015. Considine was an unused substitute forthe historic match with Serbia, which saw the Scottish men's team dramatically end more than 20 years of hurt by clinching a place at the European Championships. But a video tweeted by the Scotland National Team after the game showed him in the thick of the action as he boogie-woogied with team mates including Kieran Tierney, Scott McTominay, Leigh Griffiths and Callum McGregor.

The video immediately caught the imagination of the Tartan Army, with jubilant fans starting a campaign to get the song back to Number One in the charts. Not all the team's heroes had been able to get involved, with midfielders John McGinn and Ryan Christie - who scored Scotland's goal in the match - having to take routine drug tests while the party was kicking off in the dressing room.

Luckily for McGinn and Christie, the boogie-woogieing did indeed continue long into the night - with fresh footage of celebrations at what appears to be the team hotel in Belgrade being tweeted the next morning. This time the soundtrack of choice was Saturday Night by Whigfield as goalkeeper David Marshall led a conga around the room while teammates chanted his name to the 90s hit. Marshall had earlier written himself into Scottish football folklore by saving Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty to clinch victory in the shootout. The hit song by Baccara sold 18 million copies Singer Maria Mendiola, who formed Baccara along with Mayte Mateos, later said she was delighted that the song had found a new audience more than 40 years after its release. She told BBC Scotland: ""With this pandemic, I have been sitting at home and this has uplifted me in a way you cannot imagine. ""I will always thank the Scottish team and especially Andy Considine for making me so happy after 43 years. ""I saw all the articles and everyone was calling me. I was delighted.

The boogieing began in earnest once more as Euro 2020 got under way, with the 12,000 fans who were allowed to be inside Hampden belting out the song ahead of Scotland's opening match with the Czech Republic. The game - Scotland's first in a major tournament for 23 years - ended in a 2-0 defeat. But the result didn't appear to have dampened spirits too much ahead of the eagerly awaited clash with the Auld Enemy at Wembley. Videos of fans singing the song on planes and trains as they made their way south for the match have been racking up hundreds of thousands of view on social media. And regardless of what happens in the game, a certain song will keep the Tartan Army boogie-woogieing all night long.

"Corrie Mckeague went missing after a night out in September 2016 An airman who went missing four years ago is thought to have died after he climbed into an industrial waste bin, an inquest heard. Corrie Mckeague, 23, who was based at RAF Honington, Suffolk, is believed to have died on 24 September 2016 after a night out in Bury St Edmunds. Despite extensive searches, his body has never been found. The inquest was opened at Suffolk Coroner's Court and was adjourned for a pre-inquest review in February. Ch Supt Marina Ericson from Suffolk Police said Mr Mckeague had been on a night out in Bury St Edmunds and was ""very drunk"" when he was asked to leave the Flex nightclub. She said Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was ""happy and friendly throughout the night"" and was last seen alive at 03:25 BST walking into a horseshoe-shaped area behind Greggs and Superdrug, where industrial waste bins were stored. Ch Supt Marina Ericson said Mr Mckeague was believed to have climbed into a bin A Biffa refuse lorry drove into the area less than an hour after the last sighting of Mr Mckeague. The lorry's load weighed 116kg, 70 to 80kg more than average, she told the hearing in Ipswich. The airman's mobile phone mapped the same route as the bin lorry to Barton Mills, she said. Ch Supt Ericson said it was believed Mr Mckeague had climbed into the Greggs waste bin and was inside it when it was emptied into the Biffa lorry. ""That was where he subsequently died,"" she said. A landfill site was extensively searched as part of the investigation The chief coroner for England and Walesdirected the inquest be held into the death, following a request from Mr Mckeague's family. Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, previously said she hoped the inquest would ""be able to tell me, and us as a family, that there is just nothing else that we could do or be able to do to find Corrie"".

As the celebrations continued the morning after, veteran broadcaster Archie Macpherson described the emotions felt by many fans when the match went to penalties. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that he kept his eyes shut during the crucial shoot-out. ""I have a deep aversion to penalty shoot-outs that I think, eventually, only psychiatry will overcome,"" he said. He had commentated on the first ever penalty shoot out in European football, between Celtic and Inter Milan in Glasgow 1972 - when the first kick was missed by the home team. Mr Macpherson said: ""As the Scottish players walked up to the penalty spot I was actually seeing the ghost of Dixie Deans stepping forward and I expected to see the ball going over the bar or something like that. ""It was very, very tense and I enjoyed it like a 10-year-old schoolboy."" However, Tartan Army member Scott Husband was keen to highlight the country's perfect penalty shoot-out record. The men's team has only taken part in two - and has won them both. He said: ""I actually was very cool. I thought we were going to win it. ""We are the world champions at penalties. We have got a 100% record. We have taken 10 and scored 10."" Katie Howard will be one of the volunteers at next summer's tournament, when some of the matches will be played in Glasgow. She watched the decisive moment in her university student accommodation. ""The place blew up. It was so good,"" she said. And Scotland women's record goal scorer Julie Fleeting was still on cloud nine when she spoke to Good Morning Scotland. She said: ""I can't be the only Scot who struggled to get to sleep last night with all the excitement. ""It was just incredible. It was a tremendous way to do it.

"Kirkcaldy is one of three areas which have moved from level 2 to level 3 Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus will enter the weekend under tougher Covid restrictions. The three local authority areas are due to move from level two to level three of the Scottish government's five-tier system at 06:00 GMT on Friday. The change means about four million people in Scotland are now living under this tier. The first minister announced the changes in her first review of the Covid alert system on Tuesday. In level three areas, restrictions see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 18:00 to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks to groups of up to six from two households. Alcohol sales are not permitted indoors or outdoors. All leisure and entertainment venues are closed at this level, including cinemas. No non-essential travel is allowed out of a level three area. Indoor exercise, which includes gyms, are restricted to individual and not group exercise. Level 3- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Glasgow, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, Perth & Kinross, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian. Level 2- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Borders, Dumfries & Galloway. Level 1 -Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles. Addressing the Scottish Parliament earlier in the week, Nicola Sturgeon said the ""necessary and precautionary"" decision to move Fife, Perth and Kinross and Angus to level three was taken because cases in all three areas were on a ""sharply rising trajectory"". The change hits the hospitality industry particularly hard. Ahead of Perth and Kinross' move into level three,Gleneagles Hotel, announced it would close for 11 weeks, from Friday 13 November until 31 January. The hotel shut its doors for four months earlier this year as part of the national lockdown. George Mackay fears his bar will face tougher restrictions for a long time George Mackay runs the Path Tavern in Kirkcaldy. He has decided to close completely because it is not worth it for him to serve food without alcohol. He is also doubts about whether he will be open again before Christmas. He told BBC News: ""We will open on Friday and Saturday to honour bookings but then that's it. ""I'm really disappointed we are closing again and I can't see it being any less than three weeks. At least with the furlough scheme the staff will get paid."" Mr Mackay has spent large sums on adapting his premises, installing screens and booking regular deep cleans. He feels he can operate safely. He said: ""Every Saturday morning I have five regular customers - couples - where one has a pint and the other has a small glass of wine. I have regulars who are widowers and they come in every night for two pints and then they go home. ""There is nobody in here not doing it right. They wear masks, sit away from each other. What's the risk?"" There are currently no areas of Scotland under the most severe level four restrictions - which could be broadly compared to the national lockdown currently in place across England. But officials are monitoring sharp rises in cases in Stirling and Inverclyde, and to a lesser extent South Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire - which are all already in level three. The islands, however, will welcome a loosening of their restrictions at the same time. Up to six people from two households in Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles will be able to meet inside their homes from Friday. In Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles, people can visit other households from Friday Ms Sturgeon said this was possible because cases in the islands were ""very low and sporadic"", but warned that people who have travelled from the mainland should avoid in-house mixing for a time to limit the risk of importing the virus. Anouska Civiko, from the charity Mind Your Head, said: ""It's a very long winter here on Shetland, so for people to be able to have visitors in their own homes and see family and friends again it is just going to give everyone's mental health and wellbeing a significant boost .""

"Troops loyal to the government ride in trucks to face the Tigray People's Liberation Front forces Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned. Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre. Its officials have denied involvement. Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"". Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray. Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings -first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.,external If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November. Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down. In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings. It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities. There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces. Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"". He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible. The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November. The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"". It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from. It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP. ""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added. By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut. There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed. In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders. On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region. I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy. I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication. As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible. Read more about life in Tigray Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF. ""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement. Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"". Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership. His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials. The UN has said thatvital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopiaare at risk because of the conflict there. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains. Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray. As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well. The TPLF was instrumental in the 1991 overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam (R), seen here in 1975 with Cuban leader Fidel Castro However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by  the prime minister. Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted. The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country. Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked. Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this. For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.

As the celebrations continued the morning after, veteran broadcaster Archie Macpherson described the emotions felt by many fans when the match went to penalties. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that he kept his eyes shut during the crucial shoot-out. ""I have a deep aversion to penalty shoot-outs that I think, eventually, only psychiatry will overcome,"" he said. He had commentated on the first ever penalty shoot out in European football, between Celtic and Inter Milan in Glasgow 1972 - when the first kick was missed by the home team. Mr Macpherson said: ""As the Scottish players walked up to the penalty spot I was actually seeing the ghost of Dixie Deans stepping forward and I expected to see the ball going over the bar or something like that. ""It was very, very tense and I enjoyed it like a 10-year-old schoolboy."" However, Tartan Army member Scott Husband was keen to highlight the country's perfect penalty shoot-out record. The men's team has only taken part in two - and has won them both. He said: ""I actually was very cool. I thought we were going to win it. ""We are the world champions at penalties. We have got a 100% record. We have taken 10 and scored 10."" Katie Howard will be one of the volunteers at next summer's tournament, when some of the matches will be played in Glasgow. She watched the decisive moment in her university student accommodation. ""The place blew up. It was so good,"" she said.

She said: ""I can't be the only Scot who struggled to get to sleep last night with all the excitement. ""It was just incredible. It was a tremendous way to do it.

"Peter Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women The Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has died at the age of 74. The serial killer was serving a whole life term for murdering 13 women across Yorkshire and north-west England. His first victim's son, who was five when his mother was killed in 1975, said Sutcliffe's death would bring ""some kind of closure"". The former lorry driver, from Bradford, died in hospital where he is said to have refused treatment for Covid-19. He also had other health problems. Sutcliffe, who was also found guilty of the attempted murder of seven women, was convicted in 1981.  He spent three decades at Broadmoor Hospital before being moved to HMP Frankland in County Durham in 2016. This video can not be played Speaking before an apology from police, Richard McCann, the son of Peter Sutcliffe's first victim, Wilma McCann, reacts to his death Ex-police officer Bob Bridgestock, who worked on the case, said he ""won't be shedding any tears"" over the killer's death. The murders, which spanned five years from 1975 to 1980, began with 28-year-old mother-of-four Wilma McCann, who was hit with a hammer and stabbed 15 times, in October 1975. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times during the course of a huge investigation but continued to avoid arrest and was able to carry on killing. Twelve of the 13 women Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering: Emily Jackson, Irene Richardson, Patricia Atkinson, Jayne McDonald, Jean Jordan, Yvonne Pearson, Helen Rytka, Vera Millward, Josephine Whittaker, Barbara Leach, Marguerite Walls, Jacqueline Hill (Wilma McCann pictured below) Wilma McCann, 28, Leeds, October 1975 Emily Jackson, 42, Leeds, January 1976 Irene Richardson, 28, Leeds, February 1977 Patricia Atkinson, 32, Bradford, April 1977 Jayne McDonald, 16, Leeds, June 1977 Jean Jordan, 21, Manchester, October 1977 Yvonne Pearson, 22, Bradford, January 1978 Helen Rytka, 18, Huddersfield, January 1978 Vera Millward, 41, Manchester, May 1978 Josephine Whittaker, 19, Halifax, May 1979 Barbara Leach, 20, Bradford, September 1979 Marguerite Walls, 47, Leeds, August 1980 Jacqueline Hill, 20, Leeds, November 1980 Ms McCann's son Richard said: ""The attention he's had over the years, the continuous news stories that we've suffered over the years, there is some form of conclusion to that. ""I am sure a lot of the families, surviving children of the victims may well be glad he has gone and they have a right to feel like that."" Yorkshire Ripper's death 'should focus on victims' Yorkshire Ripper killings created 'culture of fear' BBC crime reporter recalls hunt for killer He explained that in about 2010 he had decided to let go of his anger and ""forgive"" Sutcliffe. ""I am sorry to hear he has passed away. It's not something I could have said in the past when I was consumed with anger,"" he said. Wilma McCann was the first woman Sutcliffe murdered, in 1975 Sutcliffe was dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper because he mutilated his victims' bodies. He is said to have believed he was on a ""mission from God"" to kill prostitutes, although not all of his victims were sex workers. Yorkshire Ripper death: Latest updates Was Sutcliffe involved in Sweden murders? One of his surviving victims said that 40 years on she is still affected by the attack as she walked home from a pub in Leeds in October 1980. Mo Lea, who was 20 at the time, said she had written Sutcliffe a letter while he was in prison. ""I was compelled to write to let him know how the fact that he was hanging on to the knowledge that he tried to kill me, was affecting me,"" she said. ""And I thought at least if I post it I'll know that in some way there'll be a level of understanding. I didn't expect a response and I didn't get one but it felt good to put it in the post box."" A huge police operation was launched to find Sutcliffe An inquiry held after his conviction said a backlog of case paperwork meant officers were unable to connect vital pieces of information. The first two victims, Ms McCann and Emily Jackson, were killed in Chapeltown, which was known at the time for containing Leeds' main red light district. Following the second murder, West Yorkshire Police announced they were looking for a ""prostitute killer"", leading to accusations key eyewitness evidence was being ignored as it did not fit detectives' narrative. The investigation was also misdirected by one of criminal history's cruellest hoaxes, when John Humble tricked police into believing the serial killer was a man dubbed Wearside Jack because of his gruff Sunderland accent. Police had believed he was the killer despite some survivors of attacks by Sutcliffe reporting he had a Yorkshire accent. Humble, who died in 2019, never fully explained why he taunted detectives with letters and an infamous tape recording, in which he anonymously claimed to be the serial killer. George Oldfield, centre, with detectives who initially believed the hoax tape was genuine West Yorkshire Police detectives, headed by the then assistant chief constable George Oldfield, believed the letters and tape were genuine and diverted crucial resources to the north-east of England. When Humble was eventually prosecuted, Leeds Crown Court heard claims the delays caused by the hoax left Peter Sutcliffe free to murder three more women. This video can not be played When arrested in 2005 Humble read aloud a section of the hoax tape he sent to police in 1979 Sutcliffe had violently attacked at least three women before he killed Ms McCann. In 1969, he hit a woman over the head with a stone in a sock. Sutcliffe admitted the offence, but his victim decided not to press charges. Six years later, just months before Ms McCann's death, he attacked two other women with a knife and a hammer but both survived. Sutcliffe attended Dewsbury Magistrates Court in February 1981 charged with the murder of 13 women and attempted murder of seven others Mr Oldfield's 200-strong ripper squad eventually carried out more than 130,000 interviews, visited more than 23,000 homes and checked 150,000 cars. But Joan Smith, a radio reporter in Manchester who interviewed some of the surviving victims before Sutcliffe was caught, said there were instances of ""the most blatant victim blaming"" from detectives. ""There were no women involved in this case at all - all the detectives were male, virtually all the reporters were maleâ¦ I felt that right from the beginning women didn't have a voice,"" she said. ""I don't think any woman who was around in the north of England at that time will ever be able to hear his name without some kind of shudder."" Sutcliffe died at the University Hospital of North Durham after being transferred there from maximum security HMP Frankland Mr McCann has appealed to West Yorkshire Police to make a formal apology for the language used in the 1970s to describe his mother and other victims. ""They described some of the women as 'innocent', inferring that some were not innocent - including my mum,"" he said. ""She was a family woman who, through no fault of her own, was going through adversity and made some bad decisions, some risky decisions. ""She paid for those decisions with her life."" A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ""We have received correspondence from Mr McCann and commit to continue to engage with him directly."" Angry crowds gathered outside Dewsbury Magistrates' Court when Sutcliffe appeared there following his arrest A stroke of luck eventually led to Sutcliffe's arrest when his brown Rover car, which had false number plates, was stopped by police in a red light area of Sheffield in January 1981. Mr Bridgestock, who was one of the first on the scene when Josephine Whitaker was murdered in 1979, said senior detectives ""wore blinkers"" while leading the inquiry. ""It's the victims that served the life sentence and then the victims' families that really serve the true life sentences,"" he said. ""For them today, they will have some kind of closure.""

"Dominic Cummings confirmed his upcoming departure to the BBC The departure of Dominic Cummings from Downing Street could give Boris Johnson a ""fresh start"", say Conservative MPs. A number of Tory backbenchers have welcomed newsthe prime minister's chief adviser will step down this year. It comes after the PM's director of communications, and close ally of Mr Cummings, Lee Cain,resigned. Ex-minister Theresa Villiers said the pair had been ""dismissive"" of Tory MPs, and she hoped their replacements would be ""more collegiate"" with the party. Mr Cummings confirmed to the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, late on Thursday that he would leave No 10 before Christmas. He said reports that he had threatened to quit in solidarity with Mr Cain had been ""invented"" - insteadpointing to a blog post from Januarywhere he wrote he wanted to make himself ""largely redundant"" by the end of 2020. Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas What led to Cummings' departure? Top Johnson aide Lee Cain quits amid infighting at No 10 Mr Cummings and Mr Cain were both key members of the Vote Leave campaign for leaving the EU before entering Downing Street with Mr Johnson. The confirmation of their exits come duringthe final stages of trade talks between the UK and the bloc. But No 10 said it would not affect negotiations and the government's approach remained ""unchanged"". The events of the past 48 hours feel like a political explosion, with Dominic Cummings now confirming his departure from Downing Street by the end of the year. But while it's tempting to see this is as a dramatic and sudden eruption, it has been a longer-term burn. The prime minister's chief adviser stepped back somewhat from some of the brutal day-to-day politics he had helped create after the election. He had been spending more time focusing on trying to rewire Whitehall - trying to increase the importance of science and data in government - hoping to be less involved in the moment-by-moment political rush. But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Read more from Laura here. Since taking the job at Number 10, Mr Cummings has not been a popular figure with everyone within the governing Conservative Party. He was known for making disparaging comments about some of Mr Johnson's own MPs, including labelling Brexiteers ""useful idiots"". Ms Villiers, who was environment secretary until February, welcomed the upcoming change of personnel. She told BBC News: ""I do feel these changes... are an opportunity for a fresh start, to enable the prime minister to build bridges with some of the backbenches who have become anxious about some of the direction the government has gone over recent months ""There is no doubt that both Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain were pretty dismissive of backbenchers, and on some occasion ministers and secretaries of states as well, and I don't think that was helpful."" This video can not be played Villiers: Cummings and Cain ""dismissive"" of MPs The Conservative chair of the liaison committee of senior MPs, Sir Bernard Jenkin, said Mr Cummings' departure was an ""opportunity to reset how the government operates and to emphasise some values about what we want to project as a Conservative Party in government"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was time to restore ""respect, integrity and trust"" between No 10 and Tory MPs, which he said had been ""lacking in recent months"". And fellow Tory Sir Roger Gale called the chief adviser's exit as ""an opportunity to muck out the stables"" and get a new team in. He called for Mr Cummings to go ""immediately"", telling BBC News: ""People who campaign well are not necessarily people who can run the country well. ""I believe that what the prime minister needs and deserves is a serious heavyweight political adviser behind him, who understands the scene, understands the system, knows where the bodies are buried."" Born in Durham, Dominic Cummings, 48, went to a state primary school before being privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history A longstanding Eurosceptic, he cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group and once ran a successful campaign to oppose a regionally elected assembly in north-east England In Westminster, he worked for Iain Duncan Smith when he was Conservative Party leader and Michael Gove at the Department for Education He ran the pro-Brexit Vote Leave campaign in the EU referendum and was behind the group's ""take back control"" slogan After Boris Johnson became prime minister in July 2019, he hired Mr Cummings to be his senior adviser Six months later the pair's ""Get Brexit Done"" campaign message helped the party win a large majority in the general election Mr Cummings became more of a public figure followingcontroversy over him making a trip to the north of Englandwhen non-essential travel was banned at the height of the coronavirus lockdown Read our full profile on Dominic Cummings here. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast he was ""not particularly surprised"" by the announcement, adding that ""advisers come and go over a period of time"". Asked if the departure of Mr Cummings and Mr Cain suggested the prime minister was intending to follow a very different path, Mr Shapps said the PM had ""always taken advice from a very wide range of people and doesn't always side with the same people at the end of that decision-making process"".

"The events of the past 48 hours feel like a political explosion, with Dominic Cummings now departing from Downing Street.

But given his profile, and his nature, was that ever a realistic plan? Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas Profile: Dominic Cummings Ex-Treasury adviser settles unfair dismissal claim Since the summer, there have been conversations about shifting some of the senior roles around to make No 10 run more smoothly - including, perhaps, a total exit for Mr Cummings or a different, more specific role. But in the Conservative Party, the adviser - who is not a Tory member, which rubs party people up the wrong way in itself - has been a lightning rod for irritation for years, and he became a focus for public rage too after he ignored lockdown rules anddrove to Durham. As the government's handling of the pandemic came under increasing attack, MPs became more convinced day-by-day that there needed to be change in No 10 - with Mr Cummings at the top of the list - and they grew more determined in making that case to Boris Johnson. Even those who reviled the PM's most senior adviser would acknowledge his strategy - forcing conflicts to win and drawing sharp divides between Leavers and Remainers - was effective. But as soon as the prime minister had his general election majority, there were concerns that the campaigning style was just too toxic to run a Downing Street operation with different pressures. Campaigns have to win, governments have to lead and persuade. What's burst into the open this week, with all the bitter briefings, is an acceleration of a change that was already coming. But what it won't change is the personality of the one person, the prime minister, who is meant to be in charge. Dominic Cummings' many foes absolve the PM of responsibility if they pin all the mistakes and mess on him. It's up to Boris Johnson now to build a new and more stable team, and shape what happens next.

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has said he acted reasonably and legally after driving 260 miles from his home to Durham during lockdown. What did he do and what does the guidance say? Mr Cummings was seen on Downing Street on 14 April 23 March:The prime ministertells the UK public they ""must stay at home"". People are warned not to meet friends or family members they do not live with. Those with symptoms had already been told to self-isolate. 27 March: Mr Cummingsis seen leaving 10 Downing Street,external.  ""I suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four-year-old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill.""  He went home, but after a couple of hours his wife felt better and he returned to work. Guidance:If Mr Cummings believed his wife may have had coronavirus, the guidance was that""all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days"",external. What are social distancing and self-isolation rules? Evening:Mr Cummings went on to explain - ""That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife. She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever."" Mr Cummings saidmany people he worked closely with, including the PM, had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms. He said: ""I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease."" Later:Mr Cummings drove up to Durham with his family, arriving ""at roughly midnight"". ""I was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid. ""My wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier."" Mr Cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child. Guidance:Stay at home is the simple government advice,externalfor households where one or more members have coronavirus symptoms. However, the main advice page says it is not always straightforward when children are involved. It says: ""If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible."" Other government advice did not contain this caveat, such as the leaflet drawn up at the end of March to be sent to every house. Nor did the government page onessential travel,externalwhich said: ""Essential travel does not include visits to second homes... whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence."" Durham Police said on 28 May that it did not consider that going to Durham had been an offence. The police statement stressed that it was concerned with whether Mr Cummings had breached the regulations, not the general government guidance to ""stay at home"". What are the lockdown rules for caring for children? Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? Kuenssberg: Questions remain 28 March:Mr Cummings says he woke up ""in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever"". 30 March:A No 10 source confirmed Mr Cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating ""at home"". 1 April:Durham Constabulary speak to the father of Dominic Cummings who confirms that his son and family were present at the property. 2 April:During the night, Mr Cummings' four-year-old son ""threw up and had a bad fever"". Following medical advice, an ambulance took the child to hospital. He was accompanied by Mr Cummings' wife. Mr Cummings ""could barely stand up"". 3 April:After being taken to hospital, Mr Cummings' son woke up the next day having recovered. He was tested for coronavirus and his mother, who was with him at the hospital, was told ""they should return home"" (the test result arrived days later and was negative). According to Mr Cummings, there were no taxis so he ""drove to the hospital, picked him up and returned home"". He said he ""did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody on this short trip"". But according to his wife's later article in the Spectator Mr Cummings had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs throughout this period. Guidance:People with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus and who do not require hospital treatment are told they ""must remain at home until they are well"". In March and April, the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected Covid-19 but without a confirmed test result. A spokesperson for Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area, told the BBC they ""could arrange ambulance transport via North East Ambulance Service"" in early April. 6 April:At some point in the week leading up to this date, Mr Cummings discussed his decision to travel to Durham with the prime minister. ""When we were both sick and in bed,"" he said, ""I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail."" 4-11 April:Mr Cummings said ""after I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house"". He confirmed he, his wife and his son went for a walk into woods owned by his father and it was at this point he was seen by passers-by but his family ""had no interaction with them"". The exact date is not clear but his second week isolating in Durham would have between these two dates. Guidance:Advice concerning outdoor exercise changed during the second week in April, when Mr Cummings and his family walked in the woods. Until9 April, people with coronavirus symptoms and their household were told they could exercise outdoors. On that date,the PHE advice changed to say ""any exercise should be taken within your home"",external. A separate NHS guidance page said people isolating could use their gardens. 11 April:Believing he had recovered by this date, albeit ""feeling weak and exhausted"", Mr Cummings said he ""sought expert medical advice"". ""I explained our family's symptoms and all the timings and asked if it was safe to return to work on Monday or Tuesday, seek childcare and so on. I was told that it was safe and I could return to work."" 12 April: Mr Cummings drives to Barnard Castle, about 25 miles from his parents' home in Durham, with his wife and child. He explained this episode as needing to test his driving was fine before making the long drive back to London. He said he'd been having problems with his vision. Guidance:On 28 May Durham Police said the drive to Barnard Castle""might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention"". It added that the offence was minor because there did not appear to have been any breach of the social distancing rules. The statement said that if an officer had stopped Mr Cummings on the way to Barnard Castle, they would advised him to return to Durham. The constabulary said it would not be taking retrospective action against him because it would not do so against any other member of the public. There was no mention in the statement of whether Mr Cummings was fit to drive given his concerns about his eyesight. The1988 Road Traffic Act,externalsays: ""If a person drives a motor vehicle on a road while his eyesight is such (whether through a defect which cannot be, or one which is not for the time being, sufficiently corrected) that he cannot comply with any requirement as to eyesight prescribed under this Part of this Act for the purposes of tests of competence to drive, he is guilty of an offence."" TheHighway Code,externalsays: ""You MUST report to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) any health condition likely to affect your driving."" Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable of Manchester Police, said the drive to Barnard Castle was potentially a criminal offence. ""It's not the way to test your eyesight and put, potentially, other people in danger.""On Twitter, John Apter, chair of the Police Federation for England and Wales,external, said: ""If you're feeling unwell and your eyesight may be impaired do not drive your vehicle to test your ability to drive. It's not a wise move."" Michael Gove also referred to a reason that Mr Cummings did not during his press conference. ""It was part of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well."" In the NPCC guidance referred to by Mr Gove - which was publicised in mid-April - ""driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise"" was deemed not likely to be reasonable. Mr Cummings and his family walked a few yards and sat by a riverbank for a few minutes. 13 April:Mr Cummings and his family travel back to London. 14 April:Mr Cummings is seen in Downing Street for the first time since 27 March. In his recent press conference Mr Cummings said he had written ""about the possible threat from coronaviruses last year"" but it transpired anold blog was editedon the evening of 14 April to add a short section on this. 19 April:Five days after being in London, The Observer and Mirror report that Mr Cummings is seen again in Durham by an unnamed witness. Mr Cummings says he did not return to Durham and that evidence on his phone proves this. This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row Mr Cummings insisted he did not break the law, saying: ""I believe that in all the circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in Number 10."" He said ""I don't regret what I did"" and added that ""the rules make clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and the situation I was in was exceptional circumstances"".

"Anton was paired with former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who was eliminated in the first competitive week Anton Du Beke is to join the judging panel on Strictly Come Dancing this weekend, the BBC has confirmed. The announcement comes afterMotsi Mabuse said,externalon Thursday she would be self-isolating following a trip to Germany. She had originally intended to join the show digitally this weekend, and judge the contestants from home. However, the BBC has now confirmed Du Beke will replace her on the judging panel. That means this weekend's judges will be Du Beke, Craig Revel Horwood and head judge Shirley Ballas. ""We are pleased to announce that the King of Ballroom Anton Du Beke is stepping into our judging panel this weekend,"" Strictlysaid in a statement on Twitter.,external""Good luck, Anton!"" It marks the first time Du Beke will have acted as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing, which is one of the BBC's most popular programmes. Du Beke is the longest-serving professional dancer on the show, having joined for the first series in 2004. Following the announcement, Mabuse tweeted to Anton: ""Congratulations!! All the best. I know you will be amazing. Enjoy the show guys."" The BBC said she will still be involved in the show from home, but will not be judging. Du Beke's temporary appointment comes after he was eliminated from the competition in the first competitive week of this series. He had been partnered with former home secretary Jacqui Smith. Mabuse explained to fans on Thursday why she was unable to be in the studio, saying: ""Hi guys - earlier this week I had to travel to Germany for an urgent reason. I will of course be following UK government guidelines and self-isolating for 14 days."" She added: ""I will be watching from home and by the power of technology, should be in your living rooms."" However, less than 24 hours after Mabuse's tweet, the BBC instead decided to replace her with Du Beke so there would still be three judges in the studio in person. Motsi Mabuse joined Strictly Come Dancing as a judge last year Had Mabuse taken part in the programme, she would not have been the first TV talent show judge to join proceedings from home. Jade Thirlwall recently had to dial in virtuallyto the first live episode of Little Mix: The Search after being asked to self-isolate. This series of Strictly has also seen Bruno Tonioli taking part in the Sunday results show digitally from the US. The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a tricky year for Strictly. One of the contestants, 21-year-old HRVY,contracted Covid-19 during rehearsals, but wasable to returnbefore the series had launched. Earlier this week, Nicola Adams and Katya Jones had topull out of this series after Jones tested positive for coronavirus. The show also had tostop allowing a studio audiencelast week after a second nationwide lockdown was announced by the government. Prior to that, the show had allowed a small studio audience, mostly made up of friends and family of the contestants, sitting at socially-distanced cabaret tables. However, the issues this year have not stopped the show from becoming one of the most popular series of Strictly yet, with consistently high viewing figures so far.

"John Lewis focuses on acts of kindness for its 2020 Christmas advert - inspired by the public spirit shown during the coronavirus pandemic. Its boss Pippa Wicks said it wanted an advert that was ""appropriate for how we're all feeling at the moment"". It is the latest big brand to unveil its festive campaign - with many focusing on themes involving family. Coco-Cola and Aldi's adverts show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Emma Macdonald, professor of marketing at Warwick Business School, said brands have had to tread a ""tricky line"" with the themes around their festive campaigns this year. Adverts showing lots of people outside and mixing with friends would not be ""appropriate messaging"" at a time when people are facing coronavirus restrictions. ""There's already heightened sensitivity, we're all a bit touchy, because life is a bit tougher,"" she said. ""As a business, they need to sell things to keep going. But, you know, a lot of people are saying we can't actually be buying things, we're struggling, we don't have as much money as usual. So that is a tricky balance for them. ""At the moment, it's really important for brands to stand for something meaningful, rather than just selling lots of stuff."" John Lewis' Christmas advert shows different characters helping other people, with a love heart as a central theme throughout. ""We wanted to have a message out there about thinking of others and helping families in need and people in need,"" Ms Wicks said. While there's no reference to coronavirus, zoom calls, or social distancing, the retail giant said it had deviated slightly from the style of its previous festive adverts due to the pandemic. In another step away from tradition, it commissioned singer Celeste to write and record an original song for the advert. Ten pence from each download of the track will go to charity. The advert was released at 7am on Friday on social media and was quickly trending with people sharing a mix of views. Some said it was not as good as previous Christmas adverts but others said the message of kindness was particularly important this year. Many of this year's Christmas adverts focus on the theme of families as people wait to see how the Covid restrictions will impact on their festive plans. Asda's advert shows a dad putting up festive lights, his children opening presents and eating Christmas food, and staff making a home delivery wearing face masks. The dad says: ""Christmas is going to be different this year, so let's really make the most of it. The parties might be smaller, but we can still have great food and party."" Allow YouTube content?

On a similar theme, Aldi's Christmas advert shows its mascot Kevin the Carrot getting a helping hand from Santa to get back to his family after getting lost. Morrisons and Argos' offerings show families enjoying spending time together at home, in scenes many people will be hoping for this year. Xu Zhang, assistant professor of marketing at London Business School, said the focus on families was a reflection of the situation many people have found themselves in during the pandemic. She said some people would be far away from loved ones, while others will have spent a lot more time at home with relatives due to the lockdown. The adverts this year speak to ""both sides of those segments"", she added. ""For those people spending a lot more time with their family, maybe you don't appreciate the things you used to appreciate that much. And then those adverts remind you that you should appreciate the family relationship. ""For the other part, it's different... if they don't get to spend time with their family then it becomes more important when you see these kind of adverts."" Christmas adverts - do they really work?

"John Lewis focuses on acts of kindness for its 2020 Christmas advert - inspired by the public spirit shown during the coronavirus pandemic. Its boss Pippa Wicks said it wanted an advert that was ""appropriate for how we're all feeling at the moment"". It is the latest big brand to unveil its festive campaign - with many focusing on themes involving family. Coco-Cola and Aldi's adverts show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Emma Macdonald, professor of marketing at Warwick Business School, said brands have had to tread a ""tricky line"" with the themes around their festive campaigns this year. Adverts showing lots of people outside and mixing with friends would not be ""appropriate messaging"" at a time when people are facing coronavirus restrictions. ""There's already heightened sensitivity, we're all a bit touchy, because life is a bit tougher,"" she said. ""As a business, they need to sell things to keep going. But, you know, a lot of people are saying we can't actually be buying things, we're struggling, we don't have as much money as usual. So that is a tricky balance for them. ""At the moment, it's really important for brands to stand for something meaningful, rather than just selling lots of stuff."" John Lewis' Christmas advert shows different characters helping other people, with a love heart as a central theme throughout. ""We wanted to have a message out there about thinking of others and helping families in need and people in need,"" Ms Wicks said. While there's no reference to coronavirus, zoom calls, or social distancing, the retail giant said it had deviated slightly from the style of its previous festive adverts due to the pandemic. In another step away from tradition, it commissioned singer Celeste to write and record an original song for the advert. Ten pence from each download of the track will go to charity. The advert was released at 7am on Friday on social media and was quickly trending with people sharing a mix of views. Some said it was not as good as previous Christmas adverts but others said the message of kindness was particularly important this year. Many of this year's Christmas adverts focus on the theme of families as people wait to see how the Covid restrictions will impact on their festive plans. Asda's advert shows a dad putting up festive lights, his children opening presents and eating Christmas food, and staff making a home delivery wearing face masks. The dad says: ""Christmas is going to be different this year, so let's really make the most of it. The parties might be smaller, but we can still have great food and party."" Allow YouTube content?

As the celebrations continued the morning after, veteran broadcaster Archie Macpherson described the emotions felt by many fans when the match went to penalties. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that he kept his eyes shut during the crucial shoot-out. ""I have a deep aversion to penalty shoot-outs that I think, eventually, only psychiatry will overcome,"" he said. He had commentated on the first ever penalty shoot out in European football, between Celtic and Inter Milan in Glasgow 1972 - when the first kick was missed by the home team. Mr Macpherson said: ""As the Scottish players walked up to the penalty spot I was actually seeing the ghost of Dixie Deans stepping forward and I expected to see the ball going over the bar or something like that. ""It was very, very tense and I enjoyed it like a 10-year-old schoolboy."" However, Tartan Army member Scott Husband was keen to highlight the country's perfect penalty shoot-out record. The men's team has only taken part in two - and has won them both. He said: ""I actually was very cool. I thought we were going to win it. ""We are the world champions at penalties. We have got a 100% record. We have taken 10 and scored 10."" Katie Howard will be one of the volunteers at next summer's tournament, when some of the matches will be played in Glasgow. She watched the decisive moment in her university student accommodation. ""The place blew up. It was so good,"" she said. And Scotland women's record goal scorer Julie Fleeting was still on cloud nine when she spoke to Good Morning Scotland. She said: ""I can't be the only Scot who struggled to get to sleep last night with all the excitement. ""It was just incredible. It was a tremendous way to do it.

"The R number for the UK has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

"A commemoration for the retired teacher was held in Arnhem last weekend A Dutch police chief has called for an end to ""paedophile hunting"" after a 73-year-old retired teacher was beaten up by teenagers and died of his injuries. Oscar Dros said there was a risk more people could die and he appealed for justice to be left to the authorities. The man from the eastern city of Arnhem was lured into having sexual contact with a minor while in a gay chatroom. Authorities said he was aware the boy was underage. But there was no evidence of past sexual contact with minors. The Arnhem attack is the latest in a series of 250 incidents involving so-called ""paedophile hunters"" in the Netherlands, reports say. Reports say the group of teenagers had come up with the idea of hunting for a paedophile after reading stories elsewhere in the Netherlands. The former teacher arrived at an agreed meeting point on 28 October and was then followed as he made his way home. He was beaten up by a group of boys and died later in hospital. Mayor Ahmed Marcouch has spoken of an ""awful crime"" that has had an impact on the local community. Dozens of neighbours, friends and former pupils took part in a ceremony to remember the victim last weekend. This video can not be played Lesley's father took his own life in the UK after he was pursued by ""paedophile hunters"" - then she says she received rape threats The fifteen-year-old's lawyer told local website De Gelderlander that the idea of hunting paedophiles ""happened out of boredom in this corona time"". His client had got carried away but did not himself take part in the attack. Jamil Roethof argued that the teenagers had only wished to confront the man and had no premeditated plan to attack him. He suggested he had died of a fall. Seven teenagers were arrested, six of them under the age of 18, and two have been held in custody. Police concerns over 'paedophile hunters' in UK East Netherlands regional police chief Oscar Dros appealed to Dutch citizens to ""stop paedo-hunting; stop detaining; stop provoking - leave this to us."" Mr Dros told Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that since July some 250 incidents had been registered involving self-styled hunters, and there were probably many more. The practice has now been banned by police and public prosecutors. The retired teacher was attacked in the Spijkerkwartier area of Arnhem People had been forced off the road, assaulted, threatened and publicly shamed on the internet, he said. Facebook groups have sprung up across the country, with names like pedohuntnl, and some have attracted thousands of members. One group member told public broadcaster NOS that ""we're doing this to protect children"". Minutes after going into a chatroom, he claimed, five or six men would try to meet up with you, knowing full well you were a minor. ""That's just not right."" Similar groups have appeared in the UK, prompting one assistant chief constable to say the overall activity of such groups was ""not positive"". The Dutch police chief said such vigilante behaviour ""has no effect, because the evidence these citizens believe they have is often paper thin"". He knew of not one example that had led to a paedophile being convicted.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Level 4 'under consideration' in the west Areas in the west of Scotland have been warned they may be placed under the highest level of Covid restrictions next week. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said contact had been made with councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas. They were told it was possible that restrictions may need to be increased from level three to level four. The move would see the closure of gyms, hospitality and non-essential shops. A Scottish retail trade association said it was ""deeply alarmed"" by the prospect of shops having to shut during the festive season. The Scottish government confirmed on Friday evening it had made contact with every council in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area - in most cases at chief executive level - to discuss the current situation. The chief executives of both North and South Lanarkshire Councils were also called. A spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government officials make regular contact with all local authorities to discuss plans for protection measures before these are finalised."" Mr Swinney said increases in Covid cases had also been seen in other areas, including Stirling, which is also currently in level three, and Aberdeenshire, which is in level two. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Has your area changed its Covid alert level? Fife, Perth & Kinross and Angus move into level 3 He said the national incident management team would be looking at the data over the weekend. Discussions will also take place with councils before ministers meet on Tuesday to take any decisions. Mr Swinney added that there were ""wider issues"" which would also need to be considered, such as the social and economic harm which could be caused by moving an area into level four. The highest level of coronavirus restrictions is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. The guidelines say it will only be used if ""absolutely necessary"", at a time when cases are very high and there is a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed. In response to the announcement, Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, called for the implementation of blended learning in areas which move into level four, amid concerns about school safety. The union said the growing number of pupils and teachers infected with Covid-19 raised issues over the effectiveness of virus mitigations in schools. The Scottish Retail Consortium said jobs would be lost if shops cannot trade during the festive season, which many rely on to boost winter sales. Director David Lonsdale said: ""It's already been an especially gloomy year for retail - but shop closures prior to Christmas would take us even deeper into the darkness."" Several councils confirmed they were in talks over the level 4 move. A spokesperson for North Lanarkshire said:  ""The council continues to engage with the Scottish government on the most appropriate level for North Lanarkshire to be in and we are actively encouraging residents to continue to comply with national guidance."" South Lanarkshire said it was in ""constructive dialogue"" with the Scottish government and East Renfrewshire also said discussions were continuing. The EIS union has called for the re-introduction of blended learning in level 4 areas A Renfrewshire Council spokeswoman said: ""Scottish government have contacted us, and we are in discussion with them. No decision has been taken and Renfrewshire remains in level three at present. ""The council is committed to doing everything possible to help keep Renfrewshire communities out of further restrictions and local businesses open. We are asking all of Renfrewshire to work together to stop transmission of this virus, keep our communities safe and protect local jobs."" At the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Swinney said: ""I can confirm that officials in the Scottish government have been in contact with a number of local authorities in the west of Scotland about the possibility of the area having to be increased from level three to level four. He added that a number of other local authorities around the country had been contacted because they had seen ""quite significant"" increases in rates of the virus. Mr Swinney added that the numbers were ""so stubbornly high"" in some level three areas that it raised a question of whether the restrictions were doing enough to suppress the virus. Mr Swinney added that if any area was moved into level four, this would need to be for ""a reasonable amount of time"" so that the effect of the restrictions could be seen.

It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

"The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year A people smuggler has told a jury a lorry driver phoned him to say: ""I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Gheorge Nica, 43, denies any role in the deaths of the Vietnamese nationals, who were found in Grays, Essex, on 23 October 2019, the Old Bailey has heard. He admits some people-smuggling crimes, but said he had been unaware any migrants were in the trailer in Grays. Mr Nica described the moment he knew things had gone ""very, very bad"". The migrants, aged 15 to 44, suffocated in a sealed trailer en route from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet, Essex. Mr Nica said he called driver Maurice Robinson at 01:00, having agreed for him to park the lorry at a yard in Orsett at that time. The bodies were found when the container was opened in Essex ""I say 'Well. What's going on? Are you coming or not?',"" Mr Nica told the jury. ""And he just said 'I don't know, I don't know'. ""I said 'listen, are you OK there?' And I thought in my mind he might be stopped by police or customs."" The jury heard Mr Robinson had called Mr Nica back 10 minutes later. ""I said 'Are you still coming?' ""[He said] 'I don't know. I have a problem here - dead bodies in the trailer."" Aftab Jafferjee QC, defending, asked: ""What was your reaction to that?"" Mr Nica replied: ""I said 'listen, what do you mean dead bodies?' ""He said 'yeah, there are too many'. I said 'ring the ambulance, ring the police, do not move at all'."" On what he did next, Nica said: ""I was sitting in the car and it was still very, very bad."" The next day, he travelled to Romania because he was ""scared"" of a ""big, big investigation"". He had been involved in previous smuggling and had made phone calls regarding the fatal shipment. Under cross-examination, prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said Mr Nica's version of events was ""ridiculous"". He said: ""You said 'everyone trying to escape from this situation is just telling stories'. ""You have here in one sentence exactly described your own situation."" Mr Nica, of Basildon, and lorry driver Eamonn Harrison, 23, of County Down, deny 39 counts of manslaughter. Irish haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and Mr Robinson, 26, have previously admitted manslaughter. Mr Harrison, lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, have denied being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy, which Mr Nica has admitted he was involved in.

" By Victoria Gill By Victoria Gill “I don’t frighten easily and this was terrifying,” skipper David Smith recalls of a late evening in October when his boat was approached by what looked at first like dolphins. It quickly became apparent that they were much bigger than dolphins. And they were behaving very strangely. “I looked at this animal - and it was jet black and brilliant white.” For some two hours, a group of killer whales rammed the underside of the 45ft (13.7m) yacht he was sailing off the coast of Portugal. “It was continuous,” he says. “I think there were six or seven animals, but it seemed like the juvenile ones - the smaller ones - were most active. They seemed to be going for the rudder, the wheel would just start spinning really fast every time there was an impact.” David’s job, since he “quit the rat race to sail” back in 2013, is to deliver new boats to where their owners want them moored. In this case, he was part of a team delivering a catamaran from France to Gibraltar. An hour before sunset, one of the crew called out. “He said: ‘It looks like we have some large dolphins,’” recalls David. The only other encounter he had had with an orca was more than 20 years ago in a Vancouver aquarium, but he was in no doubt that he was looking at a group of killer whales. “They were right at the back of the boat.” A sense of curiosity and excitement very quickly turned to fear when one orca disappeared beneath the boat and there was a loud thumping sound from the hull. The boat was 20 miles (32.2km) off Porto, at least three hours from the Portuguese coast. With their VHF radio out of range, they had to use the satellite phone to contact the coastguard, who advised them to switch off the motor and take down the sails. Be as “uninteresting” as possible, they said. “So then we were just drifting. But while I was on the phone I could hear them ramming the boat. At one point, one of the larger animals came right to the stern and flipped onto its back – you could see its bright white underside.” The repeated thudding, unsettling as it was, was not David’s biggest fear. As the wheel spun back and forth, he thought the animals might be about to dislodge the rudder stock - a steering column through the hull of the boat. “If that fractures, you’re really in trouble,” he says. “I was definitely preparing to ask the Portuguese coastguard to send a helicopter to get us off.” The encounter is one of at least 40 similar incidents in the area. During the summer of 2020, the strangest of summers for so many of us, a group of killer whales off the coast of Spain and Portugal began to act very strangely indeed. Accounts of the incidents suggested that the animals were deliberately targeting sailing boats. As David puts it: “They came to us, not the other way around.” The first reported incident was back in July, the most recent at the end of October. Behind international headlines about “rogue killer whales”, “orchestrated” orca attacks and the videos shared thousands of times on social media, there is a forensic marine science investigation that is still trying to work out what is driving these complex, intelligent and highly social marine mammals to behave in this way. As the light faded, the reverberating thuds from beneath the boat continued. Then David noticed the lights of a fishing boat in the distance. “We put up the sail, with the idea that if things really went south, we would have another boat to jump onto.” Finally, after two hours, as unexpectedly as it started, it all went quiet. No sound for five minutes, then nothing for 10. The wheel stopped spinning. “After about an hour, we were confident they’d left us.” The crew moved the boat closer to the coast - back within radio range. When they reached Gibraltar to carry out a more thorough check for damage, their boat became another piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation. It's not unusual to see killer whales in these Atlantic waters. For millennia they have pursued their favourite prey, bluefin tuna, as the fish migrate along the hundreds of miles of Portuguese and Spanish coast, and through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, to breed in warmer Mediterranean waters. Humans’ relationship with these orcas though has been on a knife-edge ever since we started fishing for more of that highly prized and highly priced bluefin tuna than appears to have been sustainable. Some 60 killer whales live in these waters today, that dipped to just 39 back in 2011, a decline that the Spanish conservation organisation CIRCE found was driven by a crash in bluefin tuna stocks. In 2010, international regulators slashed the annual catch that was permitted in the Mediterranean Sea. And, as the bluefin gradually recovered, so did the killer whales. Their survival remains precarious. This specific population of orcas is listed as critically endangered and protected by law. But the ongoing conservation crisis does not explain why some of them suddenly started to behave so bizarrely and apparently aggressively around boats. “I just didn’t believe it at all at first,” says Dr Ruth Esteban, a softly spoken marine scientist who chooses her words carefully, not keen to speculate about something as multi-faceted and complex as orca behaviour. Ruth now works at the Madeira Whale Museum, but she studied this population of orcas for six years - they were the subject of her PhD. “These killer whales are always curious around boats, they will approach them,” she tells me. “But touching them and causing damage? I just thought people were scared and were misinterpreting what was happening.” But the reports kept coming. In July, a sailing vessel had to be towed back to shore after a group of orcas repeatedly hit and damaged its rudder. In August, a French-flagged vessel radioed the coastguard to say it was “under attack” from killer whales. Later that same day, a Spanish naval yacht, Mirfak, lost part of its rudder after an encounter with orcas. A video of that incident showed the crew trying to outrun the animals, which appeared to pursue the boat. In September, a man sailing his boat home to Scotland from Spain suddenly had the wheel spun out of his hands. A killer whale broke the surface at the side of the boat and he says that for 45 minutes, the animals bashed and chewed at the rudder, spinning the boat around. “It’s getting worse and worse,” says Dr Renaud de Stephanis, another biologist involved in the investigation. Renaud and Ruth used to work together on orca research; Renaud has been studying this population of killer whales since the 1990s. Through his conservation research organisation, CIRCE, he carried out work that helped the animals garner their officially protected status. The two scientists are now part of a group carrying out an informal investigation into this strange, potentially dangerous behaviour.  In September, the researchers started gathering evidence. They compared footage of the incidents to a catalogue of images captured and used by CIRCE to identify the animals. Orcas each have a uniquely shaped pale grey saddle patch behind their dorsal fin, which from the surface serves as a killer whale “fingerprint”. This photo and video line-up showed that three individuals were involved in most of the incidents: juvenile males named in the official orca record as black Gladis, white Gladis and grey Gladis. Killer whales live, hunt and move in very closely connected family pods: tightly knit, matriarch-led groups that - in some populations - have even been shown to have their own pod-specific dialects. Families generally stick closely together, with long-lived grandmothers helping to raise young and to teach youngsters to hunt. Males though will wander off, mixing and mating among other pods. So far, the researchers have not worked out which family “the three Gladises” belong to. The scientists published their conclusions about the identity of the culprits, and immediately there were news reports of the “rogue pod” and the marauding “teenagers”. The media coverage became stranger - and a little darker - when the scientists also revealed that Gladis white had quite a severe injury on his head: a gash that appeared to have been caused by a boat, possibly by a propeller. This revelation caused the headlines to kick up an anthropomorphic notch: killer whales were “orchestrating revenge attacks”, said the New York Post. The UK’s Sun newspaper reported that a “rogue pod” was attacking boats “in REVENGE”. On social media, amid gifs and jokes about the ocean fighting back, there were comments suggesting people on their yachts should “stay in their mansions” and that the orcas had been enlisted in a “fight against yacht owners”. Ruth does not give much credence to the idea of vengeful orcas. “The thing is - we don’t know what came first, the injury or the first incident with a boat.” But there is one conclusion the scientists have confidently drawn from their investigation and from their years of observing these killer whales: they were playing.  “They always seem to go for the rudder, and I think that’s because it’s a mobile part of the vessel,” Ruth explains. “In some cases they can move the whole boat with it. We see, in some of the videos, the sailing boat turning almost 180 degrees. “If they see that they have the power to move something really big, maybe that’s really impressive for them.” The investigation’s conclusions, the official advice for boats about how to avoid these potentially dangerous interactions - even the news stories - hinge on understanding what drives that animals’ behaviour. So can any scientist, documentary-maker or sailor understand the mind of such a complex and intelligent marine predator? Many have tried. While orcas were historically hunted and viewed by fishing communities as dangerous pests, the 1960s saw the beginning of what was arguably an equally dangerous fascination with the animals. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, orcas were captured for display in marine parks and, to the delight of thousands of spectators, to perform tricks with a trainer. Conservationists campaigned against orca captivity for decades. But one killer whale, a large male called Tilikum who spent most of his life at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, brought the issue global headlines when he was involved in the deaths of three people. The 2013 movie Blackfish made the case that Tilikum suffered mental trauma because of life in captivity, and that drove him to attack people. Life alone in a concrete pool certainly bears little to no resemblance to the natural existence of a wild orca. The animals live, migrate and socialise in closely connected family groups that have developed different hunting techniques and modes of communication. Some populations will only eat fish, preferring one particular type. Others will work together to hunt other, sometimes much larger, whales. When the killer whales off the Spanish coast are chasing tuna, they can pursue them until the fish are exhausted. Researchers have observed some orcas appearing to “celebrate” after a kill. “I’ve seen them hunting,” says Renaud. “When they hunt, you don’t hear or see them. They are stealthy, they sneak up on their prey. I’ve seen them attacking sperm whales - that’s aggressive. “But these guys, they are playing,” he says of the recent encounters between orcas and boats. There are no recorded accounts of an orca in the wild killing a human. But when killer whales play, it can be frightening. “They can weigh 4-5 tonnes and when they play they really play,” says Renaud. Other species can be targets of their apparent boisterousness. There are published accounts of the animals smacking seabirds with their flippers and repeatedly catching and releasing them in their mouths. As top predators, aggression, dominance and shows of strength are likely to be key elements of any formative “play”. And for some of the most social animals on Earth, Dr Michael Weiss from the University of Exeter and the Center for Whale Research says, “when they play together, it could be building important social bonds”. But for David, the skipper who encountered the killer whales, the word “play” sits uncomfortably with what he felt that evening. “I just find it weird. The force that we experienced, it must have hurt them,” he says.  Neuroscientist Lori Marino, president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, is one of the few people to have seen inside the brain of a killer whale. She and her colleagues scanned the brain of a deceased captive orca for a study back in 2004. “Parts of their brains - like the limbic system that you can think of as the emotional processor - they share with us,” she explains. The Anatomical Record The Anatomical Record So orca behaviour that looks like anger, grief or joy is “probably exactly what they’re experiencing”. Lori thinks we set ourselves up to misunderstand the species entirely by trying to lump their behaviour into simple categories like good or bad, aggressive or playful. “We make them into caricatures,” she says. But there is a bigger reason for Ruth, Renaud and the team to try to adjust the language associated with these incidents. “It was really scary for the people, I can understand that,” says Ruth. “But we don’t want to call it an attack. We call it an interaction.” Ruth says the language used in news stories and social media posts - even by the coastguard - has been adversarial and loaded. She and the other researchers worry that these descriptions could be a step in a slippery journey towards persecution of critically endangered orcas. Renaud, though, does admit being frustrated and genuinely worried by the orcas’ behaviour. “From what I’m seeing, it’s mainly two of those guys [the Gladises] in particular that are just going crazy,” he says. “They just play, play and play. And the game is getting worse and worse.” Renaud has seen signs of concerning behaviour whilst out on his own boat. Last year, a juvenile that he thinks is probably one of the same animals repeatedly chased his small boat with its face pushed up to the propeller of its outboard motor. “They love it. And don’t know why,” he sighs. It just seems to be something they really like and that’s it.” No human has been hurt in any of these incidents, and on the advice of the scientists, the coastguard has modified its language. Despite this, some more recent behaviour is causing scientists genuine concern. Recently, killer whales - assumed to be the Gladises - rammed into two fishing boats off the Portuguese coast. Renaud on his research boat Renaud worries that this could be a tipping point that could bring the animals into direct conflict with the fishermen, who may see their livelihoods as well as their safety on the line. It is a situation playing out around the world. Predators including leopards, tigers and wolves are embroiled in conflicts with humans that are putting their survival in question. Experts who study some of the most intractable human-wildlife conflicts in the world, where people may feel their lives are threatened by the proximity of large predators and that their only option is to kill them, have pointed to the role of “provocative language” in fuelling these situations. Michael thinks there is something fundamental about our mentality around big predators. “If they start behaving in a way we don’t like, then they’re mean, aggressive and evil,” he says. “We would be wrong to impose our sense of right and wrong on any other animal, let alone one with its own developed sense of culture.” Lori says humans cannot even be expected to imagine how killer whales experience the world. They don’t just see the world, they hear it, echolocating and building a picture of their world based on a stream of visual and acoustic information that is all processed at the same time. “And their ability to process information is orders of magnitude faster than ours,” she says. “If you look at how they respond to one another when they’re in a pod or a group - there’s a seamlessness to their interaction.” In other words, they can be in sync in ways that our own brains are not wired to fathom. However we describe it, and however human-centric our judgement, this nudging, biting and ramming of boats is new, potentially dangerous behaviour - both for people on boats and for the killer whales. It led the Portuguese coastguard to ban small sailing vessels from a stretch of sea where some of the incidents had been reported. The biological puzzle of why this is happening remains an important one to solve. While Renaud still rejects the idea of vengeful orcas - or even that the killer whales want to damage the boats at all - he cites decades of research when he suggests this could be part of a cultural shift that is actually helping the animals to survive. Back in the mid-1990s, Renaud and his colleagues noticed that one of these orca pods had started to steal tuna from tuna boats, eating the bluefin from the end of longlines that trail in the water. Since killer whales learn from each other, the young animals in that pod learned the same trick. The pod that “invented” taking bluefin tuna from the fishing lines has increased in number. And the number of “thefts” from the boats has also gone up. “I don’t have the evidence yet,” he says, “but I would put my hand in the fire and say that this is the pod that the Gladises have come from.” It is very likely that overfishing was a driver for these culturally conservative killer whales to develop a whole new predatory culture: seeking out lines to take fish from. But has our overfishing pushed the younger orcas towards playing with boats? Have they seen mothers and grandmothers taking tuna from long lines and put their own adolescent spin on that family tradition? “They’re young males, they’re going to be rambunctious,” says Lori. “There could be an element of play, there could be an element of aggression - of trying to prove themselves.” But to say that they are just cruel and calculating or that they are just rambunctious and playful, she adds, does them a disservice. “The real truth is not either one of those things. They’re capable of cruelty, they’re capable of kindness, they’re capable of all kinds of things just like humans. “We can’t characterise them in one dimension. That’s an important lesson to learn.”  Writer: Victoria Gill Editor and Producer: James Percy Graphics: Gerry Fletcher, Rafael Fernández/Turmares Tarifa Photography: CIRCE/Renaud de Stephanis Additional images: Alamy,  The Anatomical Record, David Smith Video: Halcyon Yachts Long Reads Editor: Kathryn Westcott  Published: November 2020 ",Negative,9.310594e-20

"CaffÃ¨ Nero has been forced to launch a restructuring of its business following the second lockdown. The coffee chain is launching a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) which will allow it to renegotiate terms with its landlords and other creditors. CaffÃ¨ Nero, which employs 6,000 workers, said ""the pandemic has decimated trading"". It said it was able to navigate the first shutdown but the subsequent fire break necessitated ""further action"". The company trades across 800 shops in the UK and a further 200 sites overseas. A company facing insolvency can use a CVA to continue to trade while paying creditors such as landlords over a fixed period - if those creditors agree. CaffÃ¨ Nero said it had converted many of its shops to takeaway-only services during the first lockdown in March. But following the second shutdown, it said that, ""with many people continuing to work from home, ongoing limits to social interaction and a sustained reduction to footfall in city centres, it is unclear how long this will impact CaffÃ¨ Nero"". Lockdown retail: 'It has been the toughest year I've ever had' Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record It add that the CVA would allow the company ""to better manage its fixed costs moving forward"". ""Like so many businesses in the hospitality sector, the pandemic has decimated trading, and although we had made significant progress in navigating the financial challenges of the first lockdown, the second lockdown has made it imperative that we take further action."" said Gerry Ford, the chain's founder and chief executive. Accountancy firm KPMG has been appointed to oversee the CVA process, and landlords and creditors have until 30 November to vote on the proposal. It is understood CaffÃ¨ Nero is proposing to move most sites to turnover-based rent, and that any store closures it is  forced to make will be minimal. The hospitality sector has been one of the worst affected industries by the coronavirus pandemic because of a dearth of office workers and commuters, which are key customers. In the summer,Pret a Manger announced it was cutting 3,000 jobs, around a third of its workforce while Costa Coffee said it would axe 1,650 roles. ""Like many others across the sector, the impact of measures introduced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been devastating,"" said Will Wright, head of regional restructuring at KPMG. ""In putting forward this CVA proposal, the directors have worked hard to strike a fair compromise with stakeholders to provide the flexibility the business urgently needs to get it through the pandemic.""

"The R number for the UK has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

"Supporters of both candidates are still out on the streets 10 days after the election US election officials have said the 2020 White House vote was the ""most secure in American history"", rejecting President Donald Trump's fraud claims. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" a committee announced. They spoke out after Mr Trump claimed without proof that 2.7 million votes for him had been ""deleted"". He has yet to concede to the president-elect, Democrat Joe Biden. The result of the 3 November election was projected by all the major US TV networks last weekend. On Friday, the BBC projected Mr Biden to have won Georgia and Mr Trump to have won North Carolina. Mr Biden was earlier projected to have won Arizona. His total is now306 electoral college votes, with Mr Trump at 232. It is the first time Arizona and Georgia have voted Democrat since 1996 and 1992 respectively. After long silence, China congratulates Biden Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? Mr Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. In another development, a group of more than 150 former national security officials has warned that delaying the transition posed ""a serious risk to national security"". In a letter,external, they urged the General Services Administration - the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process - to officially recognise Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris so that they could access ""pressing national security issues"". Meanwhile, China has finally extended its congratulations to Mr Biden and Ms Harris after days of silence. ""We respect the choice of the American people,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said. Russia has said it wants to wait for an ""official result"". The announcement from US election officials marks the most direct rebuttal from federal and state officials of President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Thursday's joint statement was released by the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council,external- which is made up of senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the US Election Assistance Commission as well as state-level officials who oversee elections and representatives of the voting machine industry. ""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result,"" the group said. ""While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,"" it added, without naming Mr Trump directly. ""When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections."" This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy The statement was posted to the website of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The head of Cisa, Christopher Krebs, has reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunks election misinformation. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Election results state by state On Thursday, Mr Krebs shared a post by an election law expert that said: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Cisa assistant director Bryan Ware stepped down on Thursday. The White House had asked for his resignation earlier this week, Reuters reports. Mr Krebs expects to be fired, the news agency adds. Hours before the statement was released, Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence for the stunning claim, which appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News and was flagged by Twitter. The claim was linked to the miscounting of votes in one Republican-leaning Michigan county. Unofficial results initially favoured Mr Biden but were later corrected in President Trump's favour. State election officials acknowledged what had happened, saying human error was to blame, rather than a software malfunction. At the White House, President Trump's advisers discuss his trade policies and act as if he will remain their boss for the next several years and they will still have jobs on the premises. One of the president's economic advisers, Peter Navarro, said on Fox Business this morning that they are operating under the assumption that ""there will be a second Trump term"". When I saw Navarro recently in front of the West Wing, he seemed equally confident about his future in the building. He refused to answer questions, and he insulted journalists, just as he had always done. Then he waved vigorously at me as he slipped into the West Wing, a place where he was among friends. People outside of the White House and in other parts of town say their time is almost over. But for those who are inside the West Wing, it's business as usual. A small but growing number of Republicans are backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, was among those saying Mr Biden should start receiving the secret presidential memo, as is usual with incoming presidents. Lindsey Graham is among those backing giving Joe Biden briefings, but remains a Trump ally Republican Senators Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn and John Thune agreed, although House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Mr Biden was ""not president right now"" and should wait. Between 10 and 20 Republicans in Congress have now either congratulated Mr Biden or accepted there must be moves towards a transition. But most have yet to acknowledge the president-elect's win. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" A chorus of senior Democrats have condemned this: Former President Barack Obama said senior Republicans were undermining democracyby going along with President Trump's claims of fraud House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meanwhile said the ""absurd circus"" meant the coronavirus pandemic was being neglected. Senator Chris Coons told CNN some Republicans had been asking him to congratulate Mr Biden on their behalf because they did not feel able to do so publicly. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Republican politicians were ""deliberately casting doubt on our elections for no other reason but fear of Donald Trump"". Capitol Hill reporters say Republican lawmakers are anxious not to alienate the Trump base, given that the president just won more votes than any incumbent ever, even though he is projected to lose. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Do these Republican voters accept election result? What Trump could do after leaving the White House Party bigwigs are also said to be hoping that Mr Trump will help campaign for two Senate run-off elections in January in Georgia that will decide whether Republicans retain control of the upper chamber. Mr Biden is 5.3 million votes ahead of Mr Trump - about 3.4%, and is well beyond the hurdle of 270 electoral college votes required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Tony Blair: 'US democratic system is resilient' President Trump has kept a low key public profile since the election. Reports suggest he has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to take on the conservative network Fox News, whose full support he now feels to be lacking. According to CBS News,Mr Trump is also openly discussing a possible 2024 campaign,externalto retake the presidency. On Thursday he spoke with Pope Francis, who offered his ""blessings and congratulations"". Mr Biden will be only the second Roman Catholic president of the US. He also spoke with congressional Democratic leadership about the need for a coronavirus stimulus package as the daily US caseload from the disease soared to a new record of more than 150,000.

As the celebrations continued the morning after, veteran broadcaster Archie Macpherson described the emotions felt by many fans when the match went to penalties. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that he kept his eyes shut during the crucial shoot-out. ""I have a deep aversion to penalty shoot-outs that I think, eventually, only psychiatry will overcome,"" he said. He had commentated on the first ever penalty shoot out in European football, between Celtic and Inter Milan in Glasgow 1972 - when the first kick was missed by the home team. Mr Macpherson said: ""As the Scottish players walked up to the penalty spot I was actually seeing the ghost of Dixie Deans stepping forward and I expected to see the ball going over the bar or something like that. ""It was very, very tense and I enjoyed it like a 10-year-old schoolboy."" However, Tartan Army member Scott Husband was keen to highlight the country's perfect penalty shoot-out record. The men's team has only taken part in two - and has won them both. He said: ""I actually was very cool. I thought we were going to win it. ""We are the world champions at penalties. We have got a 100% record. We have taken 10 and scored 10."" Katie Howard will be one of the volunteers at next summer's tournament, when some of the matches will be played in Glasgow. She watched the decisive moment in her university student accommodation. ""The place blew up. It was so good,"" she said. And Scotland women's record goal scorer Julie Fleeting was still on cloud nine when she spoke to Good Morning Scotland. She said: ""I can't be the only Scot who struggled to get to sleep last night with all the excitement. ""It was just incredible. It was a tremendous way to do it.

"New cases in England have stabilised around 50,000 a day, the ONS estimates Friday's daily government figures show 27,301 new infections and 376 deaths in the UK UK R rate falls to between 1 and 1.2 - meaning the epidemic is slowing but still growing People celebrating Diwali this weekend urged to stick to lockdown rules and only meet others online Several European countries warn it's too early to say if people will be able to travel at Christmas Caffe Nero seeks help as Covid 'decimates' sales Tesco brings in online queuing system amid early Christmas delivery rush PHE report finds people with learning difficulties at six-fold risk of dying from Covid-19 Edited by Martha Buckley and Emily Young Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest coronavirus updates. The live page has been edited by Emily Young and Martha Buckley, and written by Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. And here are the latest headlines from around the
world today: We are preparing to close the live page shortly. Here's a reminder of some of the top stories in the UK today: Tulip MazumdarGlobal Health Correspondent Concerns around vaccines is nothing new. But the speed at which Covid-19 candidates are being developed, have made some people - understandably - question how it's possible to make a safe and effective vaccine so fast. It usually takes around a decade to develop a new vaccine, but in less than a year it appears scientists have created at least one for Covid. So how are they doing it? Firstly, they are well-funded - and time is money. Governments around the world, desperate for a way out of this crisis, have ploughed billions of dollars into developing a vaccine. This is unprecedented in such a short space of time. It can take scientists years just to secure funding for their research for other vaccines. With so many people potentially receiving a vaccine, safety has to be the absolute number one priority. There is a very robust international human trials process which establishes the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. The World Health Organization - which is collating all the data from trials for more than 200 vaccine candidates - says safety data cannot and will not be compromised. Studies will also continue even after vaccines are rolled out to keep track of any rare possible side effects. Also, much of what needs to happen to get a successful vaccine out to people all over the world is already under way. For example, hundreds of millions of the most promising vaccine candidates are already being manufactured. This usually only happens when a vaccine is approved for wide use. If the vaccines are found not to be effective or safe enough as trial data continues coming in, they won't be used. But if any of them are - the vaccines will be ready to deploy very quickly.

weekend's France v Fiji Six Nations rugby match has been called off after a number of the Fijian players tested
positive for Covid. Ben Morel, CEO of the Six Nations,said
it was impossible for the Fijian team to field a competitive team,external. Fiji's match against Portugal was already cancelled after three of their players tested positive. They are due to play Italy and Scotland next
weekend. Further tests will be taken in the coming days. We told you earlier about criticism of fans' behaviour in an Aberdeen pub after Scotland's win over Serbia last night. Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland have now launched an investigation after footage posted online showed people at the Draft Project pop-up bar embracing while celebrating the result. The owner of the bar has now spoken, saying staff were ""unable to prevent or contain what happened"". Stuart Clarkson, owner and founder of PB Devco, which owns the bar, said: ""Having seen the videos I am shocked, disappointed and saddened. ""This simply is not acceptable and I understand why people are so upset by this.""While we are proud of our venues and the safe environment they provide, it is clear that in this case we misjudged what was likely to happen. ""Despite having four additional members of security staff on duty, we were simply unable to contain the outbreak of joy at Scotland's success."" Aberdeen is currently in Level 2 of coronavirus restrictions and rules state no more than two households can mix in pubs. Police said there were no arrests or fixed penalty notices issued in relation to the alleged incident. Read more here. Italy has reported a record 40,902 coronavirus
cases over the past 24 hours and 550 deaths. Earlier this week, the country became the third
nation in mainland Europe to surpass one million cases, after Spain and France. There have been calls for a national lockdown
to help curb the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the worst affected countries
in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic. More than 43,000 people have died there since the
pandemic began. California has become the second US state to
hit one million cases. Texas was the first state to hit the landmark
figure. Both states now have more viral caseloads than countries including
Mexico and Germany. The US reported a record high of 153,496 new
infections on Thursday as well as 919 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins
University. Over 67,000 people are currently in hospital in
the US. Eleven counties in California have been told to
reverse some opening measures. The stateâs positivity rate â the percentage of
positive tests in the population - is now at 3.6%. California Governor Gavin Newsom urged people
to wear masks and distance. âYour actions could literally save lives,â he
said. Read more about the

Gordon Howat had been in France for the 1998 World Cup, the last major tournament Scotland have competed in. And when the team won on penalties at the Rajko Mitic stadium, he was there too - having been a pitch consultant for Red Star Belgrade since 2017. He joked: ""Sometimes you have to call in a favour and arrange a visit at the right time."" Mr Howat was spotted in the main stand with his saltire by BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin before the match. Mr Howat told him: ""I was lucky enough to be in France for the Brazil game 20-odd years ago. ""It was a great moment. I guess it was just myself and a few guys, like yourself, in the press. ""I'm sure it was big back home in Scotland, despite lockdown."" There have been 27,301 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK, according to thedaily figures released by the government,external. It brings the total - since the pandemic began - to 1,317,496. There have been a further 376 deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. It means 51,304 people have now died, under this measure.  This video can not be played Birmingham care home reunites couple separated by Covid A devoted couple who have been married for 71 years have been reunited in a care home after five weeks apart. Ken Meredith, who has dementia, has been living at Bourn View Care Home in Birmingham for five weeks. His wife Betty was unable to visit him due to the coronavirus pandemic - so decided to move in, so they could be together, without telling her husband. After self-isolating for two weeks, she was allowed to be reunited with him, and the pair were treated to a romantic dinner by care home staff. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The scientists advising the government believe the R number for the UK is between 1 and 1.2, slightly down on last weekâs 1.1-1.3. The worst case, an R of 1.2, means that the epidemic is doubling roughly every four weeks. When the epidemic had been doubling fortnightly through much of the autumn, slower growth is better news. But itâs still growth. The best case, an R of 1, means no growth. That would mean a continuation of about 50,000 cases a day in England, more across the UK, and just over 2,000 coronavirus deaths a week. It is possible that it may be below 1 in the north west of England, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scientists advising the government say we need the epidemic to shrink - for R to be below 1, consistently, before the pressure on hospitals starts to ease. The Australian prime minister said President-elect Joe Biden was ""very interested"" in how Australia has handled the pandemic US President-elect Joe Biden has invited Australia to share its findings about
containing the spread of Coronavirus, according to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The
pair spoke over the phone on Thursday,external, SBS News reports. Mr Morrison told reporters he would be
sending a copy of the National Contact Tracing review to the Biden team as well
as to President Trump. The Australian prime-minister said Mr Biden was
âvery interested in Australiaâs successâ. Australia shut its borders early on into the pandemic and introduced strict measures. The country has recorded more than 27,600 cases and 907 deaths in a country of more than 24 million people. During the election campaign, Mr Biden said he
would âlisten to the scienceâ when it came to tackling the pandemic in the US. The US has recorded 10.5 million cases and more
than 242,000 deaths since the outbreak began. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Microsoft says it has detectedcyber-attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting seven companies involved in researching vaccines,externaland treatments for Covid-19. The companyâs vice-president, Tom Burt, said in a blog post that the targets included leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from one group in Russia and two in North Korea. The ""majority"" of these attacks were said to have been blocked and the companies informed. It is not the first time that states have been accused of targeting vaccine work. In July, the UK saidRussian intelligence was behind the targeting of UK research, including on the Oxford vaccine.The US also accused China of similar activity. All of this is part of a global race for a vaccine as countries seek advantage over each other. Footballer Mo Salah has contracted the virus,
according to the Egyptian Football Association (EFA). A tweet from the association said the Liverpool

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thousands of live sheep have been travelling from Mongolia to China since late October Some 1,800 live sheep are today arriving in China today from Mongolia, and will begin the roughly 1,000 mile journey to Wuhan - the city where the coronavirus was first detected. They are the final batch of 30,000 donated to China by Mongoliaâs president, Khaltmaa Battulga, during a visit there in late February, when Wuhan was hard-hit by the virus. It was also in strict lockdown, with residents unable to leave the city, or even their buildings, without special permission. The sheep have been travelling in batches since late October. The official China Daily newspaper says sheep are a âsymbol of wealth and status in Mongoliaâ and that the gift representsâthe best wishes of the Mongolian peopleâ,external. Wuhan was the Chinese city worst hit by the coronavirus. More than 50,000 of the city's 11 million population contracted Covid-10, and some 3,800 people died. It also experiencedheavy flooding during the summer,external, impacting the agricultural sector and leading to fears about winter food shortages. The city is, however, Covid-free now and this week hosted an international health expo,which attracted some 13,000 guests from 34 countries and regions.,external The ad features a cast of characters that includes this pigeon gang The annualJohn Lewis Christmas adhas been revealed - with the boss of the shopping chain saying it wanted something ""appropriate for how we're all feeling at the moment"". It focuses on acts of kindness, inspired by the public spirit shown throughout the pandemic and shows different characters helping other people, with a love heart as a central theme throughout. ""We wanted to have a message out there about thinking of others and helping families in need and people in need,"" John Lewis's Pippa Wicks said. Other big brands have also released their adverts. Coco-Cola and Aldi's ads show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home.   YouTubewon't be producing its annual Rewind video, looking back at the previous 12 months, this year. It said in a statement: ""2020 has been different. And it doesn't feel right to carry on as if it weren't."" YouTube has produced a retrospective every year since 2010, featuring big names looking back at some of the year's viral moments. Some have been better received than others however, with the2018 video becoming the most-disliked videoon the platform. And then last year, the format of Rewind was changed, with a compilation of the most-liked videos from 2019 instead. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, who writes about YouTube and other social platforms, said it was a shame that Rewind had been cancelled because YouTube had become ""a major source of entertainment and support for people during the pandemic"". But he added: ""There's just not that much new that's come out of YouTube this year. It's been outmoded and overtaken as the place that trends begin, by more nimble apps like TikTok."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The figures from the Office for National Statistics today suggest that infections were stabilising in thefirst week of November. Yesterdayâs figures showed a sharp rise in people testing positivein the middle of this week. So if there is a sharp rise in infections towards the end of last week or early this week, we wouldnât see it in the surveysuntil next Friday. Butone dayâssharp jump doesnât establish a trend, so weâll have to wait for a few more days to know for sure. There are two main long term trends in the data on the virus, and the ONS figures fit into that picture. In the places or people where the virus has risen furthest, places like Northern Ireland, the north west of England or among teenagers and young adults, infections appear to be stabilising or even falling. But it is still rising where it has, to date, made fewer inroads. That is in places like the south of England or in those over the age of 70 who are most likely to become seriously sick. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Jessica says she thought she was going to die A mother trapped with her children when an explosion ripped through their house has spoken of the terrifying moment she could hear them screaming. Jessica Williams, and her two boys aged five and two, were inside their home inSeven Sisters, Neath Port Talbot, when it collapsed on 24 June. Both children suffered severe burns, and Jessica was placed in a coma for a month. Now Jessica has thanked neighbours who rescued her children. After hearing her screaming, neighbours rushed into the family's home on Church Street, and pulled the two children from the rubble. Jessica Williams managed to pull herself from under an American-style fridge which fell on her when the house collapsed ""When you look at the state that the house was in, to think that we all survived, it's just a miracle really. I'm just grateful that we're all here,"" she said. Reuben, five and Elliott, two, both suffered burns to around 28% of their bodies, while their mother had to be placed in an induced coma for a month. After 14 weeks in Morriston Hospital, Jessica - known as Jess - is now back with her family, and is determined to get back to full strength and one day to the family home. This video can not be played Jeff Davies described being one of the first at the scene She remembers everything about the blast, which South Wales Police has said was most likely caused by ageing LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) equipment and the hot weather. On 24 June, she had been enjoying the summer sunshine with her two children. ""We had a lovely morning, they had great fun. Elliott napped on the way home and then we stopped at the house,"" she said. There was nothing to suggest anything was wrong, until she opened the front door of their home, and the smell of gas was ""overwhelming"". ""I did panic slightly, so I sat them on the sofa and told them not to move,"" she said. ""I'm so glad I did, I just went to the oven. I can't really remember if it was ignited or not, but I went to turn the dial... and it just blew up straight away. ""It was so instant, I didn't have time to do anything differently. As soon as I turned it, it just blew up and threw me to the floor. ""Looking back I probably shouldn't have touched it, but I think when you're in a state of panic, you just do stuff, you don't really think do you? You just do it."" The community have vowed to rebuild the family's home for free after finding out it was uninsured Trapped under a large American-style fridge which had fallen in the explosion, Jessica could hear her children screaming, but could not move. ""Hearing the boys scream was so awful, because I couldn't get them,"" she said. ""A load of men just ran in the house, I was just screaming, I literally thought, 'that's it, I'm going to die right here'."" 'There was a massive bang and a plume of dust and smoke blew up' Blast-hit homes to be 'rebuilt through kindness' The group of men, who she would later discover were neighbours, raced into the house, and tried to pull some of the rubble off her, but she was screaming for her children and just wanted them to be safe. ""There was a tiny little gap which I managed to push myself out of, because I just wanted to get out of there I was so scared,"" she said. Remarkably, despite most of her body being covered in burns, Jessica managed to pull herself out of the rubble and stagger into her back garden. ""We had a load of steps up the back and I don't know how, but I managed to walk up them all to someone's house,"" she said. ""As far as myself and everyone around me was aware, it was just the burns to my skin, because I think I was bleeding and there were bits of skin hanging off me...so I didn't know there was anything internally wrong at the time. ""I could talk, I was breathing fine, I walked OK, I walked up the back garden with my flip-flops on and there were neighbours that were hosing me down, trying to sort the burns out until the emergency services arrived."" Jessica said her fiance Michael had been amazing caring for the children with their burns She was taken to Morriston Hospital to be treated in the specialised burns unit, while her two sons were airlifted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her condition deteriorated so rapidly in the ambulance that she was placed in an induced coma on arrival, one she would not wake up from for a month. As well as the burns from the explosion, she had broken ribs, a punctured lung and her kidneys were failing. At that time, her terrified father asked the surgeons what his daughter needed in order to get through her ordeal. ""Luck"" was their reply. Meanwhile, after recovering well, Reuben and Elliott were discharged from hospital before their mother woke up. ""It was quite a blessing really that I was in a coma during the time I was in hospital because if I was just lying there I'd be losing my mind thinking how are they,"" she said. Jessica is recovering at home with her family and says she is determined that life will get back to how it was before the blast When she finally woke up, she was totally unaware of the extent of the damage to her home until she was shown photographs. ""Because I was in the kitchen I could only see the damage to the kitchen, as far as I was aware the rest of the house was OK,"" she said. ""Little did I know it was absolutely ruined. ""I was really upset. It's not what I expected to see at all. It was my house, you know? To think my whole house was just rubble, it was awful to see, really awful."" This video can not be played A building firm and local people rallied around the family Since the explosion, the community has rallied around in an attempt to rebuild the house, which was not insured, as well as two neighbouring properties. One company, Ian Davies Plant Ltd, cleared the rubble ""totally free of charge"" to help the family. ""The men that were actually clearing everything said it would normally take about three days to clear up but it actually took him three weeks because he tried to go through everything he could to salvage important stuff for us,"" said Jessica. She said the workers had recovered toys and photos of treasured memories from the wreckage, and she could not thank the community enough. ""I just can't say enough thank yous to people, we've had so many donations. I'm just blown away by all the support really, it's been amazing,"" she said. The boys were sat on the sofa when the explosion ripped through the house Ms Williams said the support from her friends and family had been incredible, especially from her fiance Michael, who spent days visiting the boys in hospital while worrying about her. More than a dozen neighbours helped pull the family from the house - by a stroke of luck, many of them happened to be retired or retained firefighters. ""I haven't met them, but I have messaged them just to say thank you because at the end of the day, they didn't know if something else was going to happen in the house, and they've risked their lives really coming in to help me,"" she said. ""I was literally screaming for help. If nobody had come, I don't know how long we would have been there for. I'm just so, so grateful for them coming to help me."" Burns and injuries have left Jessica unable to move her right hand properly After 14 weeks in hospital, Jessica went home to her fiance and her two sons in October, but with their home still in ruins they are living in a relative's house. While she is recovering well, she knows she faces severe challenges. ""A lot of it is building my strength back now and getting my energy levels back,"" she said. ""I lost all my muscle tone. So I've had to learn to walk again, move my arms, everything really. I'm just trying to do little bits to get my movement back in my arms and my legs."" In hospital, doctors also performed a tracheostomy, where a small opening is cut in the throat to allow air to enter the lungs. Jessica had to learn how to swallow, eat and talk again. Her hearing was also badly damaged by the explosion, and doctors have said it might not return fully. Fourteen houses were evacuated after the explosion Before the explosion, Ms Williams worked as a pre-school leader at Ysgol Golwg y Cwm in Ystradgynlais, where her sons have now returned to school. But despite struggling to move her right hand, she is determined to regain her strength and mobility, and get back to work and running around after the children again. ""It's going to take time to come to terms with everything, and our lives have completely changed,"" she said. ""That's a big thing to come to terms with, but I just think that we can rebuild our lives now and I'm positive that we can get back to happy times and move on and look to the future."" On top of her physical challenges, she has also had to come to terms with the change in her appearance. ""It is really difficult. If somebody had told me last year 'you're going to have loads of burn injuries', I'd have been devastated, and seeing them all for the first time at the hospital was really really hard,"" she said. ""It was so upsetting. But I'm just grateful really for being here."" ""The boys are improving, I'm improving and I'm just happy that it's the best outcome we could have had really."" Jessica hopes to one day move back to the family home As for the house on Church Road, she said she was not yet ready to go back and see it, but at some point she does want to move home. ""I have passed it in the car which was really difficult. I haven't stopped there yet, because I just think that's a little bit too much for me at the minute,"" she added. ""We're going to try our best to live there because at the end of the day that's our home and that's where we were happy. Until I'm there, I don't know how we're going to feel.""

"Rishi Sunak lit candles outside 11 Downing Street on Thursday to mark the festival Chancellor Rishi Sunak says celebrating Diwali this year will be difficult but has urged others also marking the event to stick to lockdown restrictions. Mr Sunak, a practising Hindu, encouraged families to meet up virtually this weekend, adding: ""We're going to get through this."" Outdoor celebrations around the UK have been called off due to the pandemic. With a nationwide lockdown in place in England, many councils are providing online Diwali celebrations on Saturday. Diwali is the five-day festival of lights, celebrated across the world by millions of Hindus and Jains, who traditionally illuminate their homes with candles and lanterns. This year it began on Thursday, with the main day of celebrations taking place on Saturday. Making the most of a lockdown Diwali Diwali celebrations move online for lockdown Mr Sunak, speaking to the BBC's Sima Kotecha, said: ""Faith is important to me, I'm a practising Hindu, I pray with my kids, visit the temple when I can - at the moment rather less so because I'm busy. ""For us as Hindus, Diwali is special, and it's going to be difficult this year. ""But we've got Zoom, we've got the phone, and most importantly, we've got each other. Whether you can see someone or not the bond of family, that bond of love is always going to be there. And it will be there on 3 December as well."" Lockdown restrictions in England mean families cannot meet up with people from different households or go to the temple for group worship. The nationwide restrictions are due to end on 2 December, and Mr Sunak said families need ""to stick with this for a couple more weeks"". ""We're going to get through this,"" he said. ""And it's going to be so much better on the other side. And we'll have lots of happy times afterwards. But to keep everyone safe right now, just follow the rules."" This video can not be played Sisters Chaaya and Maaya won't be celebrating Diwali with their wider family this year The chancellor also defended the government's ambition of lifting lockdown before Christmas, despite accusations that other faith celebrations such as Diwali had been overlooked. ""Of course this is a secular country. But Christmas is also a national time when regardless of whether you're going to midnight Mass or to church, it's a time when most people have time off work, we have holidays, state holidays, it is a time when everyone hangs out. ""I mean, I'm Hindu, but I'm also equally going to be tucking in to my Christmas meal - the kids are excited about that."" He added: ""We've had restrictions all the way through this year at different times, in different parts of the country. And it's affected all sorts of people in different ways."" The rules for people celebrating Diwali together this year are different because of the current restrictions in place. But what are the regulations for meeting friends and family around the UK? Englandis under its second national lockdown. People are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or social bubble indoors or in private gardens InScotland,with the exception of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, people are not allowed to meet anyone outside their household or extended household inside a private home Two households can form a bubble and meet in their own homes inWales InNorthern Ireland,you must not socialise with anyone from outside your household, or bubble, indoors in private homes For more on the latest regulations around the UK,read our explainer. Some of Britain's most popular temples will be hosting virtual ceremonies to mark the festival. A floating flower display in Canary Wharf, London, to mark Diwali Tens of thousands of people usually join Diwali celebrations in Leicester - believed to be among the biggest outside of India - but the city council is this year asking people to send in video messages as part of their online celebrations. The families adapting to celebrate lockdown Diwali Scots prepare for restricted Diwali festival London's main Diwali celebration, which usually attracts around 30,000 people to Trafalgar Square, has also been replaced with an online event. Similar outdoor celebrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff have been cancelled this year due to restrictions in Scotland and Wales, though digital events including performances will also be held in their place.

"Fresh figures shows black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched in a car than a white person Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for police traffic stops to be reviewed to look at whether black people are disproportionately affected by some police tactics. The year-long pilot scheme forms part of an Action Plan published by City Hall to help improve trust in the Met. It comes as Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick admitted the Met ""is not free from racism or discrimination"". Mr Khan said ""more must be done and will be done through this Action Plan"". City Hall published the report to look at concerns that black Londoners are disproportionately affected by policing powers. New data shows black people are four times more likely to be stopped and searched in public than a white person. They are also six times more likely to be stopped in their vehicles, according to City Hall. The mayor wants communities to scrutinise such policing tactics to improve trust and confidence in the Met. He has set aside Â£1.7m to improve police training and a drive on recruiting more black officers, with the force is aiming for 40% of new recruits to be from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds from 2022. Natalie Bennett was stopped by police while driving in Wandsworth Natalie Bennett was driving in Wandsworth last year when she was stopped by police who believed she might be hiding drugs or stolen goods. The Met apologised for its actions, but Ms Bennett said she was left terrified by the experience and still had nightmares. ""Every time I see a police car, a marked car, or a police officer... I can literally feel my heart going through my whole body,"" she said. The nurse told the BBC she believed there was a ""significant difference when you see how the police approach black people to when they approach white people. ""Why is that? Is this about unconscious biases that are deep-seated inside these officers which need to be addressed?"" Progress has been made by the Met since the Macpherson Inquiry more than 20 years ago, following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, Mr Khan said. There are now more than 5,000 BAME officers in the force - up from just over 3,000 a decade ago. ""[But] it's simply not right that Black Londoners have less trust and confidence in our police service,"" Mr Khan said. ""It's something I am determined to resolve. ""More must be done - and will be done through this Action Plan - properly to recognise and address the impact that some police tactics used disproportionately on black people is having. ""This starts with involving communities and ensuring they have proper oversight and scrutiny of stop and search, the use of Tasers and the use of force, as well as in the training of new police officers so they can better understand the trauma that the disproportionate use of police powers can have on black Londoners."" Met Police 'uses force more' against black people Black men 'stopped and searched over fist bump' City Hall said the Met Police ""welcomed"" the plan and was committed to talking on the points raised. Dame Cressida said the Met had ""zero tolerance of racism"" but she admitted that the force ""is not free of discrimination, racism or bias"". ""I am committed to redoubling our efforts to deliver a better service for, and with, black Londoners, to doing all we can to help them be safe, and to increase their trust in us,"" she said. Katharine Carpenter, BBC London Home Affairs correspondent A City Hall source has described the new measures as ""the most significant changes to policing and black communities since The Macpherson Report"". They certainly indicate that the mayor and Met have been listening to Londoners' concerns about the disproportionate use of force on black people and an apparent lack of accountability. Across the capital, Community Monitoring Groups already scrutinise officers' use of stop and search, but members of the organisation London Citizens, who were consulted on Mr Khan's plan, told me they particularly welcomed the chance to probe the actions of the Territorial Support Group and Violent Crime Taskforce. What's not clear is what powers, if any, community groups will have if they think officers have behaved inappropriately. If these measures aren't accompanied by real change, in attitudes and outcomes, they may well be met with a frustrated eye-roll by those who feel they've heard it all before.

"Supporters of both candidates are still out on the streets 10 days after the election US election officials have said the 2020 White House vote was the ""most secure in American history"", rejecting President Donald Trump's fraud claims. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" a committee announced. They spoke out after Mr Trump claimed without proof that 2.7 million votes for him had been ""deleted"". He has yet to concede to the president-elect, Democrat Joe Biden. The result of the 3 November election was projected by all the major US TV networks last weekend. On Friday, the BBC projected Mr Biden to have won Georgia and Mr Trump to have won North Carolina. Mr Biden was earlier projected to have won Arizona. His total is now306 electoral college votes, with Mr Trump at 232. It is the first time Arizona and Georgia have voted Democrat since 1996 and 1992 respectively. After long silence, China congratulates Biden Biden has won: What happens now? How will this endless US election end? Mr Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and levelled unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud. In another development, a group of more than 150 former national security officials has warned that delaying the transition posed ""a serious risk to national security"". In a letter,external, they urged the General Services Administration - the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process - to officially recognise Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris so that they could access ""pressing national security issues"". Meanwhile, China has finally extended its congratulations to Mr Biden and Ms Harris after days of silence. ""We respect the choice of the American people,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said. Russia has said it wants to wait for an ""official result"". The announcement from US election officials marks the most direct rebuttal from federal and state officials of President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Thursday's joint statement was released by the Election Infrastructure Government Co-ordinating Council,external- which is made up of senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the US Election Assistance Commission as well as state-level officials who oversee elections and representatives of the voting machine industry. ""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result,"" the group said. ""While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,"" it added, without naming Mr Trump directly. ""When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections."" This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy The statement was posted to the website of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The head of Cisa, Christopher Krebs, has reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over aCisa website called Rumor Control,external, which debunks election misinformation. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Election results state by state On Thursday, Mr Krebs shared a post by an election law expert that said: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Cisa assistant director Bryan Ware stepped down on Thursday. The White House had asked for his resignation earlier this week, Reuters reports. Mr Krebs expects to be fired, the news agency adds. Hours before the statement was released, Mr Trump tweeted that voting software used in 28 states had deleted millions of votes for him, but presented no evidence for the stunning claim, which appeared to originate from the obscure TV network One America News and was flagged by Twitter. The claim was linked to the miscounting of votes in one Republican-leaning Michigan county. Unofficial results initially favoured Mr Biden but were later corrected in President Trump's favour. State election officials acknowledged what had happened, saying human error was to blame, rather than a software malfunction. At the White House, President Trump's advisers discuss his trade policies and act as if he will remain their boss for the next several years and they will still have jobs on the premises. One of the president's economic advisers, Peter Navarro, said on Fox Business this morning that they are operating under the assumption that ""there will be a second Trump term"". When I saw Navarro recently in front of the West Wing, he seemed equally confident about his future in the building. He refused to answer questions, and he insulted journalists, just as he had always done. Then he waved vigorously at me as he slipped into the West Wing, a place where he was among friends. People outside of the White House and in other parts of town say their time is almost over. But for those who are inside the West Wing, it's business as usual. A small but growing number of Republicans are backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. Senator Lindsey Graham, a key Trump ally, was among those saying Mr Biden should start receiving the secret presidential memo, as is usual with incoming presidents. Lindsey Graham is among those backing giving Joe Biden briefings, but remains a Trump ally Republican Senators Chuck Grassley, John Cornyn and John Thune agreed, although House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Mr Biden was ""not president right now"" and should wait. Between 10 and 20 Republicans in Congress have now either congratulated Mr Biden or accepted there must be moves towards a transition. But most have yet to acknowledge the president-elect's win. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" A chorus of senior Democrats have condemned this: Former President Barack Obama said senior Republicans were undermining democracyby going along with President Trump's claims of fraud House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meanwhile said the ""absurd circus"" meant the coronavirus pandemic was being neglected. Senator Chris Coons told CNN some Republicans had been asking him to congratulate Mr Biden on their behalf because they did not feel able to do so publicly. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Republican politicians were ""deliberately casting doubt on our elections for no other reason but fear of Donald Trump"". Capitol Hill reporters say Republican lawmakers are anxious not to alienate the Trump base, given that the president just won more votes than any incumbent ever, even though he is projected to lose. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Do these Republican voters accept election result? What Trump could do after leaving the White House Party bigwigs are also said to be hoping that Mr Trump will help campaign for two Senate run-off elections in January in Georgia that will decide whether Republicans retain control of the upper chamber. Mr Biden is 5.3 million votes ahead of Mr Trump - about 3.4%, and is well beyond the hurdle of 270 electoral college votes required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Tony Blair: 'US democratic system is resilient' President Trump has kept a low key public profile since the election. Reports suggest he has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to take on the conservative network Fox News, whose full support he now feels to be lacking. According to CBS News,Mr Trump is also openly discussing a possible 2024 campaign,externalto retake the presidency. On Thursday he spoke with Pope Francis, who offered his ""blessings and congratulations"". Mr Biden will be only the second Roman Catholic president of the US. He also spoke with congressional Democratic leadership about the need for a coronavirus stimulus package as the daily US caseload from the disease soared to a new record of more than 150,000.

"The R number for the UK has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

"Advisers are meant to be seen, not heard. There has, however, rarely been a political aide more visible than Dominic Cummings. He first became particularly known to some for his role as the chief of the campaign to leave the EU, then again as Boris Johnson's provocative senior adviser. But then he found notoriety - and became known to a much wider public who wouldn't always know Westminster figures when, during lockdown, it emerged that the close aide of a prime minister who told people to ""Stay at home, save lives, protect the NHS"" had made a journey of hundreds of miles from London to Barnard Castle. Now after boiling tensions in No 10, Mr Cummings is on his way out. He wrote last year he hoped to make himself ""redundant"" by the end of 2020 and told me late last night that is what he will do. There's no question the announcement of his departure by the end of the year was accelerated by turmoil in No 10 in recent days -  a swirl of split loyalties and factions. Top Johnson aide quits amid infighting at No 10 Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas A No 10 insider told me Mr Cummings ""jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon"", suggesting that, in the last few days, the prime minister saw that the former Vote Leave team was just ""in it for themselves"". Indeed, for many Conservatives, Mr Cummings' departure, alongside that of Lee Cain, the former director of communications, brings a chance for a reset. One member of the Cabinet even told me Mr Cummings' exit was a ""blessing"". And yet Dominic Cummings was valued hugely by Boris Johnson - one of the relentless architects of the prime minister's path to a hefty majority. One adviser told me it was a ""huge error to let him go"" - it would allow the Tories to ""regress to being a party of rich southerners and MPs nodding along"". It was perhaps inevitable that the Vote Leave tribe would fight so hard they hurt themselves in the process. Loved by some, loathed by others, the departure of the Vote Leave duo represents a big change at the highest level of government - Boris Johnson losing two of his aides who became controversial but who were also key to creating the political version of him.

"Troops loyal to the government ride in trucks to face the Tigray People's Liberation Front forces Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned. Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre. Its officials have denied involvement. Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"". Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray. Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings -first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.,external If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November. Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down. In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings. It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities. There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces. Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"". He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible. The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November. The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"". It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from. It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP. ""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added. By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut. There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed. In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped. Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders. On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region. I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy. I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication. As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible. Read more about life in Tigray Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF. ""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement. Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"". Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership. His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials. The UN has said thatvital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopiaare at risk because of the conflict there. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains. Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray. As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well. The TPLF was instrumental in the 1991 overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam (R), seen here in 1975 with Cuban leader Fidel Castro However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by  the prime minister. Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted. The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country. Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked. Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this. For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.

"Students could be routinely issued university offers based on actual exam results rather than predicted grades in future, under a proposed shake-up. A post-qualifications admissions (PQA) system could be introduced across the UK by 2023-24, says Universities UK. The plan is one of a series of recommendations from an 18-month review by university leaders across Britain. It comes after a chaotic summer exam results process meant many students lost places on their chosen courses. Some reports over the years have suggested a switch to exam results, arguing it would be fairer to candidates from less-affluent backgrounds. But universities previously cited the timescale between when A-level, B-Tec and other exam results are received, and courses starting as a reason not to proceed. The review also calls for the scrapping of ""conditional unconditional offers"", under which students are offered guaranteed places regardless of results if they make an institution their firm choice. It says the use of regular unconditional offers should be restricted to specific circumstances, including where such decisions have been informed by an interview, audition, submission of work or a skills test. A new code of practice should be developed to make clear that the use of incentives in offer-making, such as financial inducements, should not add any pressure to candidates, the report adds. Failure to follow the code would result in sanctions against universities, UUK said. The recommendations come after the universities admissions service Ucas proposed that students could apply to university after receiving their A-levels, and then start courses in January. But the UUK report raises concerns about the disruption that would cause to school timetables and university competitiveness overseas. The review acknowledges that switching to PQA might still be challenging for courses that are highly selective, as it could be difficult to arrange interviews, and there may be an increase in admissions tests. It could also mean there were fewer teachers available over the summer to help students make decisions, and less time for applicants to respond to offers. The organisation says it will consult universities, schools and government to develop and further test the workability of the new approach. Professor Quintin McKellar, vice-chancellor of the University of Hertfordshire and chairman of the Fair Admissions Review, said: ""There isn't a perfect one-size-fits-all solution for the variety of courses and institutions, but the review has decided it would be fairer for students to receive university places based on exam results, not predictions."" He added that any change should be taken forward carefully by universities, with further consultation with students, government, and those working across the education sector. ""We need to be confident that any new process will allow for effective careers advice and support for applicants,"" he said. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""The current system is based on inaccurately predicted results and leads to those from less-affluent backgrounds losing out. ""Allowing students to apply after they receive their results will help level the playing field and put a stop to the chaotic clearing scramble."" She added: ""UCU and many sector leaders now agree the time has come for the UK to join the rest of the world and finally to move away from the current unfair system."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Teachers work hard and diligently to provide accurate predicted grades, but it is not an exact science and never can be. ""Post-qualification admissions would be better and fairer.""

"A commemoration for the retired teacher was held in Arnhem last weekend A Dutch police chief has called for an end to ""paedophile hunting"" after a 73-year-old retired teacher was beaten up by teenagers and died of his injuries. Oscar Dros said there was a risk more people could die and he appealed for justice to be left to the authorities. The man from the eastern city of Arnhem was lured into having sexual contact with a minor while in a gay chatroom. Authorities said he was aware the boy was underage. But there was no evidence of past sexual contact with minors. The Arnhem attack is the latest in a series of 250 incidents involving so-called ""paedophile hunters"" in the Netherlands, reports say. Reports say the group of teenagers had come up with the idea of hunting for a paedophile after reading stories elsewhere in the Netherlands. The former teacher arrived at an agreed meeting point on 28 October and was then followed as he made his way home. He was beaten up by a group of boys and died later in hospital. Mayor Ahmed Marcouch has spoken of an ""awful crime"" that has had an impact on the local community. Dozens of neighbours, friends and former pupils took part in a ceremony to remember the victim last weekend. This video can not be played Lesley's father took his own life in the UK after he was pursued by ""paedophile hunters"" - then she says she received rape threats The fifteen-year-old's lawyer told local website De Gelderlander that the idea of hunting paedophiles ""happened out of boredom in this corona time"". His client had got carried away but did not himself take part in the attack. Jamil Roethof argued that the teenagers had only wished to confront the man and had no premeditated plan to attack him. He suggested he had died of a fall. Seven teenagers were arrested, six of them under the age of 18, and two have been held in custody. Police concerns over 'paedophile hunters' in UK East Netherlands regional police chief Oscar Dros appealed to Dutch citizens to ""stop paedo-hunting; stop detaining; stop provoking - leave this to us."" Mr Dros told Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that since July some 250 incidents had been registered involving self-styled hunters, and there were probably many more. The practice has now been banned by police and public prosecutors. The retired teacher was attacked in the Spijkerkwartier area of Arnhem People had been forced off the road, assaulted, threatened and publicly shamed on the internet, he said. Facebook groups have sprung up across the country, with names like pedohuntnl, and some have attracted thousands of members. One group member told public broadcaster NOS that ""we're doing this to protect children"". Minutes after going into a chatroom, he claimed, five or six men would try to meet up with you, knowing full well you were a minor. ""That's just not right."" Similar groups have appeared in the UK, prompting one assistant chief constable to say the overall activity of such groups was ""not positive"". The Dutch police chief said such vigilante behaviour ""has no effect, because the evidence these citizens believe they have is often paper thin"". He knew of not one example that had led to a paedophile being convicted.

"This video can not be played BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra plays Yes Sir, I Can Boogie Thousands of Scotland fans are in London ahead of their Euro 2020 match with England - but the skirl of the bagpipes has largely been drowned out by a 1970s disco classic. Videos of the Tartan Army belting out Yes Sir, I Can Boogie on the streets of the English capital have been all over social media. So how did the song become the country's unofficial national anthem? It started when a video of ecstatic players dancing to the tune went viral after Scotland clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November. The song by Spanish duo Baccara spent a single week at the top of the UK charts in 1977. But last year it got a fresh lease of life when it was used by theKeeping the Ball on the Ground podcast,externalas a tribute to defender Andrew Considine. Scotland defender Andrew Considine (centre) dressed in drag to dance to the tune on his stag do five years ago The Aberdeen cult hero - who was called up to the Scotland team for the first time last year at the age of 33 - famously starred in a spoof video of the song on his stag do. The player was unrecognisable as hedressed in dragto strut his stuff to the tune alongside friends and his father, with the professionally-produced video being played on his wedding day in 2015. Considine was an unused substitute forthe historic match with Serbia, which saw the Scottish men's team dramatically end more than 20 years of hurt by clinching a place at the European Championships. But a video tweeted by the Scotland National Team after the game showed him in the thick of the action as he boogie-woogied with team mates including Kieran Tierney, Scott McTominay, Leigh Griffiths and Callum McGregor.

The video immediately caught the imagination of the Tartan Army, with jubilant fans starting a campaign to get the song back to Number One in the charts. Not all the team's heroes had been able to get involved, with midfielders John McGinn and Ryan Christie - who scored Scotland's goal in the match - having to take routine drug tests while the party was kicking off in the dressing room.

Luckily for McGinn and Christie, the boogie-woogieing did indeed continue long into the night - with fresh footage of celebrations at what appears to be the team hotel in Belgrade being tweeted the next morning. This time the soundtrack of choice was Saturday Night by Whigfield as goalkeeper David Marshall led a conga around the room while teammates chanted his name to the 90s hit. Marshall had earlier written himself into Scottish football folklore by saving Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty to clinch victory in the shootout. The hit song by Baccara sold 18 million copies Singer Maria Mendiola, who formed Baccara along with Mayte Mateos, later said she was delighted that the song had found a new audience more than 40 years after its release. She told BBC Scotland: ""With this pandemic, I have been sitting at home and this has uplifted me in a way you cannot imagine. ""I will always thank the Scottish team and especially Andy Considine for making me so happy after 43 years. ""I saw all the articles and everyone was calling me. I was delighted.

The boogieing began in earnest once more as Euro 2020 got under way, with the 12,000 fans who were allowed to be inside Hampden belting out the song ahead of Scotland's opening match with the Czech Republic. The game - Scotland's first in a major tournament for 23 years - ended in a 2-0 defeat. But the result didn't appear to have dampened spirits too much ahead of the eagerly awaited clash with the Auld Enemy at Wembley. Videos of fans singing the song on planes and trains as they made their way south for the match have been racking up hundreds of thousands of view on social media.

"Charities are calling for more testing of staff and residents in care homes People with learning disabilities were up to six times more likely to die from Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, analysis shows. Areport from Public Health England,external(PHE) found the death rate for those with a learning disability was 30 times higher in the 18-34 age group. The charity Mencap said the government had ""failed to protect"" a group already experiencing health inequalities. Social Care Minister Helen Whately has announced a review of the findings. The study, which looked at deaths between 21 March and 5 June, found that 451 per 100,000 people registered with a learning disability had died with Covid-19 during that period. Due to gaps in the data, the researchers estimated that it could be as high as 692 per 100,000 - 6.3 times higher than the general population. The report suggests the huge disparity could be because people with learning disabilities are more prone to obesity and diabetes, which can increase the risk of dying from Covid-19. Adam Brown died in April after becoming ill with Covid-19 Adam Brown from Surrey was one of those young people with learning disabilities who died from Covid-19. The 30-year-old, who lived in residential care, fell ill at the beginning of March. Despite displaying the symptoms of Covid-19, he wasn't tested until he was admitted to hospital. He died on 29 April. Commenting on the report's findings, his sister Naomi Brown said: ""Hearing and reading reports like this doesn't surprise me, it saddens me but it's not surprising. ""People like Adam, people who don't have their own voices to speak for themselves are just left, kept in the dark, disregarded. ""There's only us, the families, to speak and stand up for people like my brother."" Prof John Newton, PHE's director of health improvement, said ""action must be taken to prevent this happening again"". He said: ""It is deeply troubling that one of the most vulnerable groups in our society suffered so much during the first wave of the pandemic. ""But with cases developing across the country, it is essential to practice rigorous infection control if you are in contact with someone with a learning disability, whether or not they live in a care home."" Do you have a tribute to a loved one? A third of those who died with a learning disability during the first wave were living in residential care, which has led to criticism about infection control and lack of access to testing. Dan Scorer, head of policy at the learning disability charity Mencap, said: ""The government has failed to protect a group who already experienced serious health inequalities. ""Decades of under-investment in social care has left most people with a learning disability with no support to understand ever-changing guidance on staying safe and accessing testing."" The report highlighted that certain kinds of learning disability, such as Down's Syndrome can make people more vulnerable to respiratory infections. Adults with the condition have recently been added to the government's ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" list. Almost half of those with Down Syndrome who died from Covid-19 were living in a care home. The Down's Syndrome Association said priority must be given ""to measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in these settings, including regular testing of care staff"". Responding to the report, Ms Whately said the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, would be asked to review the findings. ""There is now regular testing of staff and residents in care homes, and testing has also been rolled out to supported living settings in high risk areas,"" she added.

" By Victoria Gill By Victoria Gill “I don’t frighten easily and this was terrifying,” skipper David Smith recalls of a late evening in October when his boat was approached by what looked at first like dolphins. It quickly became apparent that they were much bigger than dolphins. And they were behaving very strangely. “I looked at this animal - and it was jet black and brilliant white.” For some two hours, a group of killer whales rammed the underside of the 45ft (13.7m) yacht he was sailing off the coast of Portugal. “It was continuous,” he says. “I think there were six or seven animals, but it seemed like the juvenile ones - the smaller ones - were most active. They seemed to be going for the rudder, the wheel would just start spinning really fast every time there was an impact.” David’s job, since he “quit the rat race to sail” back in 2013, is to deliver new boats to where their owners want them moored. In this case, he was part of a team delivering a catamaran from France to Gibraltar. An hour before sunset, one of the crew called out. “He said: ‘It looks like we have some large dolphins,’” recalls David. The only other encounter he had had with an orca was more than 20 years ago in a Vancouver aquarium, but he was in no doubt that he was looking at a group of killer whales. “They were right at the back of the boat.” A sense of curiosity and excitement very quickly turned to fear when one orca disappeared beneath the boat and there was a loud thumping sound from the hull. The boat was 20 miles (32.2km) off Porto, at least three hours from the Portuguese coast. With their VHF radio out of range, they had to use the satellite phone to contact the coastguard, who advised them to switch off the motor and take down the sails. Be as “uninteresting” as possible, they said. “So then we were just drifting. But while I was on the phone I could hear them ramming the boat. At one point, one of the larger animals came right to the stern and flipped onto its back – you could see its bright white underside.” The repeated thudding, unsettling as it was, was not David’s biggest fear. As the wheel spun back and forth, he thought the animals might be about to dislodge the rudder stock - a steering column through the hull of the boat. “If that fractures, you’re really in trouble,” he says. “I was definitely preparing to ask the Portuguese coastguard to send a helicopter to get us off.” The encounter is one of at least 40 similar incidents in the area. During the summer of 2020, the strangest of summers for so many of us, a group of killer whales off the coast of Spain and Portugal began to act very strangely indeed. Accounts of the incidents suggested that the animals were deliberately targeting sailing boats. As David puts it: “They came to us, not the other way around.” The first reported incident was back in July, the most recent at the end of October. Behind international headlines about “rogue killer whales”, “orchestrated” orca attacks and the videos shared thousands of times on social media, there is a forensic marine science investigation that is still trying to work out what is driving these complex, intelligent and highly social marine mammals to behave in this way. As the light faded, the reverberating thuds from beneath the boat continued. Then David noticed the lights of a fishing boat in the distance. “We put up the sail, with the idea that if things really went south, we would have another boat to jump onto.” Finally, after two hours, as unexpectedly as it started, it all went quiet. No sound for five minutes, then nothing for 10. The wheel stopped spinning. “After about an hour, we were confident they’d left us.” The crew moved the boat closer to the coast - back within radio range. When they reached Gibraltar to carry out a more thorough check for damage, their boat became another piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation. It's not unusual to see killer whales in these Atlantic waters. For millennia they have pursued their favourite prey, bluefin tuna, as the fish migrate along the hundreds of miles of Portuguese and Spanish coast, and through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, to breed in warmer Mediterranean waters. Humans’ relationship with these orcas though has been on a knife-edge ever since we started fishing for more of that highly prized and highly priced bluefin tuna than appears to have been sustainable. Some 60 killer whales live in these waters today, that dipped to just 39 back in 2011, a decline that the Spanish conservation organisation CIRCE found was driven by a crash in bluefin tuna stocks. In 2010, international regulators slashed the annual catch that was permitted in the Mediterranean Sea. And, as the bluefin gradually recovered, so did the killer whales. Their survival remains precarious. This specific population of orcas is listed as critically endangered and protected by law. But the ongoing conservation crisis does not explain why some of them suddenly started to behave so bizarrely and apparently aggressively around boats. “I just didn’t believe it at all at first,” says Dr Ruth Esteban, a softly spoken marine scientist who chooses her words carefully, not keen to speculate about something as multi-faceted and complex as orca behaviour. Ruth now works at the Madeira Whale Museum, but she studied this population of orcas for six years - they were the subject of her PhD. “These killer whales are always curious around boats, they will approach them,” she tells me. “But touching them and causing damage? I just thought people were scared and were misinterpreting what was happening.” But the reports kept coming. In July, a sailing vessel had to be towed back to shore after a group of orcas repeatedly hit and damaged its rudder. In August, a French-flagged vessel radioed the coastguard to say it was “under attack” from killer whales. Later that same day, a Spanish naval yacht, Mirfak, lost part of its rudder after an encounter with orcas. A video of that incident showed the crew trying to outrun the animals, which appeared to pursue the boat. In September, a man sailing his boat home to Scotland from Spain suddenly had the wheel spun out of his hands. A killer whale broke the surface at the side of the boat and he says that for 45 minutes, the animals bashed and chewed at the rudder, spinning the boat around. “It’s getting worse and worse,” says Dr Renaud de Stephanis, another biologist involved in the investigation. Renaud and Ruth used to work together on orca research; Renaud has been studying this population of killer whales since the 1990s. Through his conservation research organisation, CIRCE, he carried out work that helped the animals garner their officially protected status. The two scientists are now part of a group carrying out an informal investigation into this strange, potentially dangerous behaviour.  In September, the researchers started gathering evidence. They compared footage of the incidents to a catalogue of images captured and used by CIRCE to identify the animals. Orcas each have a uniquely shaped pale grey saddle patch behind their dorsal fin, which from the surface serves as a killer whale “fingerprint”. This photo and video line-up showed that three individuals were involved in most of the incidents: juvenile males named in the official orca record as black Gladis, white Gladis and grey Gladis. Killer whales live, hunt and move in very closely connected family pods: tightly knit, matriarch-led groups that - in some populations - have even been shown to have their own pod-specific dialects. Families generally stick closely together, with long-lived grandmothers helping to raise young and to teach youngsters to hunt. Males though will wander off, mixing and mating among other pods. So far, the researchers have not worked out which family “the three Gladises” belong to. The scientists published their conclusions about the identity of the culprits, and immediately there were news reports of the “rogue pod” and the marauding “teenagers”. The media coverage became stranger - and a little darker - when the scientists also revealed that Gladis white had quite a severe injury on his head: a gash that appeared to have been caused by a boat, possibly by a propeller. This revelation caused the headlines to kick up an anthropomorphic notch: killer whales were “orchestrating revenge attacks”, said the New York Post. The UK’s Sun newspaper reported that a “rogue pod” was attacking boats “in REVENGE”. On social media, amid gifs and jokes about the ocean fighting back, there were comments suggesting people on their yachts should “stay in their mansions” and that the orcas had been enlisted in a “fight against yacht owners”. Ruth does not give much credence to the idea of vengeful orcas. “The thing is - we don’t know what came first, the injury or the first incident with a boat.” But there is one conclusion the scientists have confidently drawn from their investigation and from their years of observing these killer whales: they were playing.  “They always seem to go for the rudder, and I think that’s because it’s a mobile part of the vessel,” Ruth explains. “In some cases they can move the whole boat with it. We see, in some of the videos, the sailing boat turning almost 180 degrees. “If they see that they have the power to move something really big, maybe that’s really impressive for them.” The investigation’s conclusions, the official advice for boats about how to avoid these potentially dangerous interactions - even the news stories - hinge on understanding what drives that animals’ behaviour. So can any scientist, documentary-maker or sailor understand the mind of such a complex and intelligent marine predator? Many have tried. While orcas were historically hunted and viewed by fishing communities as dangerous pests, the 1960s saw the beginning of what was arguably an equally dangerous fascination with the animals. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, orcas were captured for display in marine parks and, to the delight of thousands of spectators, to perform tricks with a trainer. Conservationists campaigned against orca captivity for decades. But one killer whale, a large male called Tilikum who spent most of his life at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, brought the issue global headlines when he was involved in the deaths of three people. The 2013 movie Blackfish made the case that Tilikum suffered mental trauma because of life in captivity, and that drove him to attack people. Life alone in a concrete pool certainly bears little to no resemblance to the natural existence of a wild orca. The animals live, migrate and socialise in closely connected family groups that have developed different hunting techniques and modes of communication. Some populations will only eat fish, preferring one particular type. Others will work together to hunt other, sometimes much larger, whales. When the killer whales off the Spanish coast are chasing tuna, they can pursue them until the fish are exhausted. Researchers have observed some orcas appearing to “celebrate” after a kill. “I’ve seen them hunting,” says Renaud. “When they hunt, you don’t hear or see them. They are stealthy, they sneak up on their prey. I’ve seen them attacking sperm whales - that’s aggressive. “But these guys, they are playing,” he says of the recent encounters between orcas and boats. There are no recorded accounts of an orca in the wild killing a human. But when killer whales play, it can be frightening. “They can weigh 4-5 tonnes and when they play they really play,” says Renaud. Other species can be targets of their apparent boisterousness. There are published accounts of the animals smacking seabirds with their flippers and repeatedly catching and releasing them in their mouths. As top predators, aggression, dominance and shows of strength are likely to be key elements of any formative “play”. And for some of the most social animals on Earth, Dr Michael Weiss from the University of Exeter and the Center for Whale Research says, “when they play together, it could be building important social bonds”. But for David, the skipper who encountered the killer whales, the word “play” sits uncomfortably with what he felt that evening. “I just find it weird. The force that we experienced, it must have hurt them,” he says.  Neuroscientist Lori Marino, president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, is one of the few people to have seen inside the brain of a killer whale. She and her colleagues scanned the brain of a deceased captive orca for a study back in 2004. “Parts of their brains - like the limbic system that you can think of as the emotional processor - they share with us,” she explains. The Anatomical Record The Anatomical Record So orca behaviour that looks like anger, grief or joy is “probably exactly what they’re experiencing”. Lori thinks we set ourselves up to misunderstand the species entirely by trying to lump their behaviour into simple categories like good or bad, aggressive or playful. “We make them into caricatures,” she says. But there is a bigger reason for Ruth, Renaud and the team to try to adjust the language associated with these incidents. “It was really scary for the people, I can understand that,” says Ruth. “But we don’t want to call it an attack. We call it an interaction.” Ruth says the language used in news stories and social media posts - even by the coastguard - has been adversarial and loaded. She and the other researchers worry that these descriptions could be a step in a slippery journey towards persecution of critically endangered orcas. Renaud, though, does admit being frustrated and genuinely worried by the orcas’ behaviour. “From what I’m seeing, it’s mainly two of those guys [the Gladises] in particular that are just going crazy,” he says. “They just play, play and play. And the game is getting worse and worse.” Renaud has seen signs of concerning behaviour whilst out on his own boat. Last year, a juvenile that he thinks is probably one of the same animals repeatedly chased his small boat with its face pushed up to the propeller of its outboard motor. “They love it. And don’t know why,” he sighs. It just seems to be something they really like and that’s it.” No human has been hurt in any of these incidents, and on the advice of the scientists, the coastguard has modified its language. Despite this, some more recent behaviour is causing scientists genuine concern. Recently, killer whales - assumed to be the Gladises - rammed into two fishing boats off the Portuguese coast. Renaud on his research boat Renaud worries that this could be a tipping point that could bring the animals into direct conflict with the fishermen, who may see their livelihoods as well as their safety on the line. It is a situation playing out around the world. Predators including leopards, tigers and wolves are embroiled in conflicts with humans that are putting their survival in question. Experts who study some of the most intractable human-wildlife conflicts in the world, where people may feel their lives are threatened by the proximity of large predators and that their only option is to kill them, have pointed to the role of “provocative language” in fuelling these situations. Michael thinks there is something fundamental about our mentality around big predators. “If they start behaving in a way we don’t like, then they’re mean, aggressive and evil,” he says. “We would be wrong to impose our sense of right and wrong on any other animal, let alone one with its own developed sense of culture.” Lori says humans cannot even be expected to imagine how killer whales experience the world. They don’t just see the world, they hear it, echolocating and building a picture of their world based on a stream of visual and acoustic information that is all processed at the same time. “And their ability to process information is orders of magnitude faster than ours,” she says. “If you look at how they respond to one another when they’re in a pod or a group - there’s a seamlessness to their interaction.” In other words, they can be in sync in ways that our own brains are not wired to fathom. However we describe it, and however human-centric our judgement, this nudging, biting and ramming of boats is new, potentially dangerous behaviour - both for people on boats and for the killer whales. It led the Portuguese coastguard to ban small sailing vessels from a stretch of sea where some of the incidents had been reported. The biological puzzle of why this is happening remains an important one to solve. While Renaud still rejects the idea of vengeful orcas - or even that the killer whales want to damage the boats at all - he cites decades of research when he suggests this could be part of a cultural shift that is actually helping the animals to survive. Back in the mid-1990s, Renaud and his colleagues noticed that one of these orca pods had started to steal tuna from tuna boats, eating the bluefin from the end of longlines that trail in the water. Since killer whales learn from each other, the young animals in that pod learned the same trick. The pod that “invented” taking bluefin tuna from the fishing lines has increased in number. And the number of “thefts” from the boats has also gone up. “I don’t have the evidence yet,” he says, “but I would put my hand in the fire and say that this is the pod that the Gladises have come from.” It is very likely that overfishing was a driver for these culturally conservative killer whales to develop a whole new predatory culture: seeking out lines to take fish from. But has our overfishing pushed the younger orcas towards playing with boats? Have they seen mothers and grandmothers taking tuna from long lines and put their own adolescent spin on that family tradition? “They’re young males, they’re going to be rambunctious,” says Lori. “There could be an element of play, there could be an element of aggression - of trying to prove themselves.” But to say that they are just cruel and calculating or that they are just rambunctious and playful, she adds, does them a disservice. “The real truth is not either one of those things. They’re capable of cruelty, they’re capable of kindness, they’re capable of all kinds of things just like humans. “We can’t characterise them in one dimension. That’s an important lesson to learn.”  Writer: Victoria Gill Editor and Producer: James Percy Graphics: Gerry Fletcher, Rafael Fernández/Turmares Tarifa Photography: CIRCE/Renaud de Stephanis Additional images: Alamy,  The Anatomical Record, David Smith Video: Halcyon Yachts Long Reads Editor: Kathryn Westcott  Published: November 2020 ",Positive,0.9998542

When Andrea Williams arrived at her husband's hospital bedside, she played their wedding song and told him it was time to rest. Mark was 58 years old when he died in April, just weeks after contracting Covid-19. Andrea shared her story as families called for greater access to bereavement support for those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic. To datemore than 2,000 people are known to have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales figures. Many who have lost loved ones say they were unable to say goodbye due to lockdown restrictions, while doctors have spoken of comforting patients whose relatives have been unable to be at their bedsides when they died. Now, a virtual group has been set up for those grieving to support each other. TheCovid-19 Families Wales' Group,externalis calling for greater access to bereavement counselling during the pandemic. The Welsh Government said it had given Â£900,000 to hospices and services to help those who had lost loved ones during this time. Mark Williams was fit and healthy and loved kayaking ""I find it easier if I am talking to someone who also lost their husband,"" said Andrea. The couple had only been married for two years when Mark, a lecturer, from Sully in the Vale of Glamorgan, died on 25 April, after being on a ventilator at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. ""I played our wedding music and just said goodbye. I told him it was time to rest,"" she said, remembering the moment he died. Andrea said she knew she would not be judged on the group when she discussed things like taking her husband's ashes to bed with her when she could not sleep. ""They know exactly what I am going through."" Samantha Andrews-Pierce with her father Terry on her wedding day When Terry Andrews, a retired psychiatric nurse, died at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Denbighshire, in April, his family was unable to be at his bedside. 'Every time my phone rings, I still think it's her' Has Covid-19 changed the way we talk about death? Dealing with grief during a lockdown The 75-year-old had been ill for some time and on haemodialysis in hospital, but died after testing positive for coronavirus. ""It just goes through my head that we weren't there for him,"" his daughter Samantha Andrews-Pierce said. The group wants to get better support for those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic Samantha, from Denbigh, said she had found comfort in the group and had struggled with not being able to say goodbye to her father properly due to restrictions. ""We haven't been able to bury him,"" she said. ""We haven't had a wake, which I think is a massive thing when you're grieving. We had 10 at the funeral [but] we weren't allowed to sit with our mum."" Dennis Kierle died earlier this year after contracting coronavirus Mandy Howells, from Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the death of her father, 79-year-old Dennis Kierle, in April still ""didn't seem real"". ""I try to put a brave face on when I'm with my mum,"" she said. ""I feel that, on this group... they know exactly what you are feeling and thinking because they are going through it themselves. ""It's helped me - emotionally."" Nicola and her father John, who she described as ""energetic and enthusiastic"", in happier times The group is now trying to get members access to counselling, but Nicola Thomas from Swansea said there was a waiting list for support. Her father, John Bennett, a project manager for Tata Steel, died aged 69 after contracting the virus in April. ""In relation to bereavement, there is a feeling that the GPs tend to offer you anti-depressants or diazepam to help you sleep, but counselling is important as well,"" she said. ""The effects on the bereaved doesn't get talked about very much on the news. ""As soon as we are able, we want to get together as a group - even if it's just a coffee and share stories. We can gain something from that kind of friendship. ""We've got a common aim that we want our relatives remembered."" The Welsh Government said it had provided Â£900,000 of support to hospices and bereavement providers to increase the level of support. It comes after an announcement earlier this year of an additional Â£1m for bereavement services from April next year. ""We send our heartfelt condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this cruel virus,"" a spokesman said. ""We are also developing a national bereavement framework to support the establishment of clear referral pathways, bereavement standards and a directory of available bereavement provision.""

"This video can not be played ""I knew I was going in hospital to say goodbye to my husband"" ""They called me at midnight and I knew I was going in just to say goodbye."" When Andrea Williams arrived at her husband's hospital bedside, she played their wedding song and told him it was time to rest. Mark was 58 years old when he died in April, just weeks after contracting Covid-19. Andrea shared her story as families called for greater access to bereavement support for those who have lost loved ones in the pandemic. To datemore than 2,000 people are known to have died with coronavirus in Wales, according to Public Health Wales figures. Many who have lost loved ones say they were unable to say goodbye due to lockdown restrictions, while doctors have spoken of comforting patients whose relatives have been unable to be at their bedsides when they died. Now, a virtual group has been set up for those grieving to support each other. TheCovid-19 Families Wales' Group,externalis calling for greater access to bereavement counselling during the pandemic. The Welsh Government said it had given Â£900,000 to hospices and services to help those who had lost loved ones during this time. Mark Williams was fit and healthy and loved kayaking ""I find it easier if I am talking to someone who also lost their husband,"" said Andrea. The couple had only been married for two years when Mark, a lecturer, from Sully in the Vale of Glamorgan, died on 25 April, after being on a ventilator at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. ""I played our wedding music and just said goodbye. I told him it was time to rest,"" she said, remembering the moment he died. Andrea said she knew she would not be judged on the group when she discussed things like taking her husband's ashes to bed with her when she could not sleep. ""They know exactly what I am going through."" Samantha Andrews-Pierce with her father Terry on her wedding day When Terry Andrews, a retired psychiatric nurse, died at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Denbighshire, in April, his family was unable to be at his bedside. 'Every time my phone rings, I still think it's her' Has Covid-19 changed the way we talk about death? Dealing with grief during a lockdown The 75-year-old had been ill for some time and on haemodialysis in hospital, but died after testing positive for coronavirus. ""It just goes through my head that we weren't there for him,"" his daughter Samantha Andrews-Pierce said. The group wants to get better support for those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic Samantha, from Denbigh, said she had found comfort in the group and had struggled with not being able to say goodbye to her father properly due to restrictions. ""We haven't been able to bury him,"" she said. ""We haven't had a wake, which I think is a massive thing when you're grieving. We had 10 at the funeral [but] we weren't allowed to sit with our mum."" Dennis Kierle died earlier this year after contracting coronavirus Mandy Howells, from Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the death of her father, 79-year-old Dennis Kierle, in April still ""didn't seem real"". ""I try to put a brave face on when I'm with my mum,"" she said. ""I feel that, on this group... they know exactly what you are feeling and thinking because they are going through it themselves. ""It's helped me - emotionally."" Nicola and her father John, who she described as ""energetic and enthusiastic"", in happier times The group is now trying to get members access to counselling, but Nicola Thomas from Swansea said there was a waiting list for support. Her father, John Bennett, a project manager for Tata Steel, died aged 69 after contracting the virus in April. ""In relation to bereavement, there is a feeling that the GPs tend to offer you anti-depressants or diazepam to help you sleep, but counselling is important as well,"" she said. ""The effects on the bereaved doesn't get talked about very much on the news. ""As soon as we are able, we want to get together as a group - even if it's just a coffee and share stories. We can gain something from that kind of friendship. ""We've got a common aim that we want our relatives remembered."" The Welsh Government said it had provided Â£900,000 of support to hospices and bereavement providers to increase the level of support. It comes after an announcement earlier this year of an additional Â£1m for bereavement services from April next year. ""We send our heartfelt condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one to this cruel virus,"" a spokesman said. ""We are also developing a national bereavement framework to support the establishment of clear referral pathways, bereavement standards and a directory of available bereavement provision.""

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT. People with learning disabilities wereup to six times more likely to die from Covid-19during the first wave of the pandemic, Public Health England analysis suggests. It has prompted the charity Mencap to accuse the government of failing to protect a group already experiencing health inequalities. Social Care Minister Helen Whately says more testing is being carried out in care homes and among those most at risk. Apartial reopening of some sectors in Northern Ireland has been delayed until next Fridayafter a compromise was reached by the executive. Those offering some close-contact services, such as hair and beauty salons and driving instructors, will be able to resume trade by appointment on 20 November, when cafes and coffee shops reopen. However, a ""graduated"" reopening of hospitality means restaurants, pubs and hotels will not welcome customers inside until a week later. Some849 police officers in the UK have tested positive for Covidsince the pandemic began, according to figures from 24 of the UK's 45 police forces. The Police Federation, which represents officers, says they are in ""constant worry"" when confronting offenders who might spit, bite or cough at them. Anyone hoping to book flights to see relatives in Europe this Christmas might want to hang fire. Irish and Frenchauthorities say it's too soon to say whether people can make travel arrangementswhile, in Sweden, people have been told to prepare for possible travel restrictions during the holiday period. Lockdowns and other measures remain in force in several countries. ChancellorRishi Sunak accepts celebrating Diwali will be a challengethis weekend, without temple visits, fireworks and family feasting, but is urging fellow Hindus to stick to lockdown restrictions.

The live page has been edited by Emily Young and Martha Buckley, and written by Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. And here are the latest headlines from around the
world today: We are preparing to close the live page shortly. Here's a reminder of some of the top stories in the UK today: Tulip MazumdarGlobal Health Correspondent Concerns around vaccines is nothing new. But the speed at which Covid-19 candidates are being developed, have made some people - understandably - question how it's possible to make a safe and effective vaccine so fast. It usually takes around a decade to develop a new vaccine, but in less than a year it appears scientists have created at least one for Covid. So how are they doing it? Firstly, they are well-funded - and time is money. Governments around the world, desperate for a way out of this crisis, have ploughed billions of dollars into developing a vaccine. This is unprecedented in such a short space of time. It can take scientists years just to secure funding for their research for other vaccines. With so many people potentially receiving a vaccine, safety has to be the absolute number one priority. There is a very robust international human trials process which establishes the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. The World Health Organization - which is collating all the data from trials for more than 200 vaccine candidates - says safety data cannot and will not be compromised. Studies will also continue even after vaccines are rolled out to keep track of any rare possible side effects. Also, much of what needs to happen to get a successful vaccine out to people all over the world is already under way. For example, hundreds of millions of the most promising vaccine candidates are already being manufactured. This usually only happens when a vaccine is approved for wide use. If the vaccines are found not to be effective or safe enough as trial data continues coming in, they won't be used. But if any of them are - the vaccines will be ready to deploy very quickly.

weekend's France v Fiji Six Nations rugby match has been called off after a number of the Fijian players tested
positive for Covid. Ben Morel, CEO of the Six Nations,said
it was impossible for the Fijian team to field a competitive team,external. Fiji's match against Portugal was already cancelled after three of their players tested positive. They are due to play Italy and Scotland next
weekend. Further tests will be taken in the coming days. We told you earlier about criticism of fans' behaviour in an Aberdeen pub after Scotland's win over Serbia last night. Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland have now launched an investigation after footage posted online showed people at the Draft Project pop-up bar embracing while celebrating the result. The owner of the bar has now spoken, saying staff were ""unable to prevent or contain what happened"". Stuart Clarkson, owner and founder of PB Devco, which owns the bar, said: ""Having seen the videos I am shocked, disappointed and saddened. ""This simply is not acceptable and I understand why people are so upset by this.""While we are proud of our venues and the safe environment they provide, it is clear that in this case we misjudged what was likely to happen. ""Despite having four additional members of security staff on duty, we were simply unable to contain the outbreak of joy at Scotland's success."" Aberdeen is currently in Level 2 of coronavirus restrictions and rules state no more than two households can mix in pubs. Police said there were no arrests or fixed penalty notices issued in relation to the alleged incident. Read more here. Italy has reported a record 40,902 coronavirus
cases over the past 24 hours and 550 deaths. Earlier this week, the country became the third
nation in mainland Europe to surpass one million cases, after Spain and France. There have been calls for a national lockdown
to help curb the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the worst affected countries
in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic. More than 43,000 people have died there since the
pandemic began. California has become the second US state to
hit one million cases. Texas was the first state to hit the landmark
figure. Both states now have more viral caseloads than countries including
Mexico and Germany. The US reported a record high of 153,496 new
infections on Thursday as well as 919 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins
University. Over 67,000 people are currently in hospital in
the US. Eleven counties in California have been told to
reverse some opening measures. The stateâs positivity rate â the percentage of
positive tests in the population - is now at 3.6%. California Governor Gavin Newsom urged people
to wear masks and distance. âYour actions could literally save lives,â he

Gordon Howat had been in France for the 1998 World Cup, the last major tournament Scotland have competed in. And when the team won on penalties at the Rajko Mitic stadium, he was there too - having been a pitch consultant for Red Star Belgrade since 2017. He joked: ""Sometimes you have to call in a favour and arrange a visit at the right time."" Mr Howat was spotted in the main stand with his saltire by BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin before the match. Mr Howat told him: ""I was lucky enough to be in France for the Brazil game 20-odd years ago. ""It was a great moment. I guess it was just myself and a few guys, like yourself, in the press. ""I'm sure it was big back home in Scotland, despite lockdown."" There have been 27,301 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK, according to thedaily figures released by the government,external. It brings the total - since the pandemic began - to 1,317,496. There have been a further 376 deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. It means 51,304 people have now died, under this measure.  This video can not be played Birmingham care home reunites couple separated by Covid A devoted couple who have been married for 71 years have been reunited in a care home after five weeks apart. Ken Meredith, who has dementia, has been living at Bourn View Care Home in Birmingham for five weeks. His wife Betty was unable to visit him due to the coronavirus pandemic - so decided to move in, so they could be together, without telling her husband. After self-isolating for two weeks, she was allowed to be reunited with him, and the pair were treated to a romantic dinner by care home staff. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The scientists advising the government believe the R number for the UK is between 1 and 1.2, slightly down on last weekâs 1.1-1.3. The worst case, an R of 1.2, means that the epidemic is doubling roughly every four weeks. When the epidemic had been doubling fortnightly through much of the autumn, slower growth is better news. But itâs still growth. The best case, an R of 1, means no growth. That would mean a continuation of about 50,000 cases a day in England, more across the UK, and just over 2,000 coronavirus deaths a week. It is possible that it may be below 1 in the north west of England, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scientists advising the government say we need the epidemic to shrink - for R to be below 1, consistently, before the pressure on hospitals starts to ease. The Australian prime minister said President-elect Joe Biden was ""very interested"" in how Australia has handled the pandemic US President-elect Joe Biden has invited Australia to share its findings about
containing the spread of Coronavirus, according to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The
pair spoke over the phone on Thursday,external, SBS News reports. Mr Morrison told reporters he would be
sending a copy of the National Contact Tracing review to the Biden team as well
as to President Trump. The Australian prime-minister said Mr Biden was
âvery interested in Australiaâs successâ. Australia shut its borders early on into the pandemic and introduced strict measures. The country has recorded more than 27,600 cases and 907 deaths in a country of more than 24 million people. During the election campaign, Mr Biden said he
would âlisten to the scienceâ when it came to tackling the pandemic in the US. The US has recorded 10.5 million cases and more
than 242,000 deaths since the outbreak began. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Microsoft says it has detectedcyber-attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting seven companies involved in researching vaccines,externaland treatments for Covid-19. The companyâs vice-president, Tom Burt, said in a blog post that the targets included leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from one group in Russia and two in North Korea. The ""majority"" of these attacks were said to have been blocked and the companies informed. It is not the first time that states have been accused of targeting vaccine work. In July, the UK saidRussian intelligence was behind the targeting of UK research, including on the Oxford vaccine.The US also accused China of similar activity. All of this is part of a global race for a vaccine as countries seek advantage over each other. Footballer Mo Salah has contracted the virus,
according to the Egyptian Football Association (EFA). A tweet from the association said the Liverpool
starhad
tested positive,externalbut was not suffering from any symptoms. The Egyptian national team are preparing for their African Cup of

Coco-Cola and Aldi's ads show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home.   YouTubewon't be producing its annual Rewind video, looking back at the previous 12 months, this year. It said in a statement: ""2020 has been different. And it doesn't feel right to carry on as if it weren't."" YouTube has produced a retrospective every year since 2010, featuring big names looking back at some of the year's viral moments. Some have been better received than others however, with the2018 video becoming the most-disliked videoon the platform. And then last year, the format of Rewind was changed, with a compilation of the most-liked videos from 2019 instead. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, who writes about YouTube and other social platforms, said it was a shame that Rewind had been cancelled because YouTube had become ""a major source of entertainment and support for people during the pandemic"". But he added: ""There's just not that much new that's come out of YouTube this year. It's been outmoded and overtaken as the place that trends begin, by more nimble apps like TikTok."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The figures from the Office for National Statistics today suggest that infections were stabilising in thefirst week of November. Yesterdayâs figures showed a sharp rise in people testing positivein the middle of this week. So if there is a sharp rise in infections towards the end of last week or early this week, we wouldnât see it in the surveysuntil next Friday. Butone dayâssharp jump doesnât establish a trend, so weâll have to wait for a few more days to know for sure. There are two main long term trends in the data on the virus, and the ONS figures fit into that picture. In the places or people where the virus has risen furthest, places like Northern Ireland, the north west of England or among teenagers and young adults, infections appear to be stabilising or even falling. But it is still rising where it has, to date, made fewer inroads. That is in places like the south of England or in those over the age of 70 who are most likely to become seriously sick. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fresh figures shows black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched in a car than a white person Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for police traffic stops to be reviewed to look at whether black people are disproportionately affected by some police tactics. The year-long pilot scheme forms part of an Action Plan published by City Hall to help improve trust in the Met. It comes as Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick admitted the Met ""is not free from racism or discrimination"". Mr Khan said ""more must be done and will be done through this Action Plan"". City Hall published the report to look at concerns that black Londoners are disproportionately affected by policing powers. New data shows black people are four times more likely to be stopped and searched in public than a white person. They are also six times more likely to be stopped in their vehicles, according to City Hall. The mayor wants communities to scrutinise such policing tactics to improve trust and confidence in the Met. He has set aside Â£1.7m to improve police training and a drive on recruiting more black officers, with the force is aiming for 40% of new recruits to be from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds from 2022. Natalie Bennett was stopped by police while driving in Wandsworth Natalie Bennett was driving in Wandsworth last year when she was stopped by police who believed she might be hiding drugs or stolen goods. The Met apologised for its actions, but Ms Bennett said she was left terrified by the experience and still had nightmares. ""Every time I see a police car, a marked car, or a police officer... I can literally feel my heart going through my whole body,"" she said. The nurse told the BBC she believed there was a ""significant difference when you see how the police approach black people to when they approach white people. ""Why is that? Is this about unconscious biases that are deep-seated inside these officers which need to be addressed?"" Progress has been made by the Met since the Macpherson Inquiry more than 20 years ago, following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, Mr Khan said. There are now more than 5,000 BAME officers in the force - up from just over 3,000 a decade ago. ""[But] it's simply not right that Black Londoners have less trust and confidence in our police service,"" Mr Khan said. ""It's something I am determined to resolve. ""More must be done - and will be done through this Action Plan - properly to recognise and address the impact that some police tactics used disproportionately on black people is having. ""This starts with involving communities and ensuring they have proper oversight and scrutiny of stop and search, the use of Tasers and the use of force, as well as in the training of new police officers so they can better understand the trauma that the disproportionate use of police powers can have on black Londoners."" Met Police 'uses force more' against black people Black men 'stopped and searched over fist bump' City Hall said the Met Police ""welcomed"" the plan and was committed to talking on the points raised. Dame Cressida said the Met had ""zero tolerance of racism"" but she admitted that the force ""is not free of discrimination, racism or bias"". ""I am committed to redoubling our efforts to deliver a better service for, and with, black Londoners, to doing all we can to help them be safe, and to increase their trust in us,"" she said. Katharine Carpenter, BBC London Home Affairs correspondent A City Hall source has described the new measures as ""the most significant changes to policing and black communities since The Macpherson Report"". They certainly indicate that the mayor and Met have been listening to Londoners' concerns about the disproportionate use of force on black people and an apparent lack of accountability. Across the capital, Community Monitoring Groups already scrutinise officers' use of stop and search, but members of the organisation London Citizens, who were consulted on Mr Khan's plan, told me they particularly welcomed the chance to probe the actions of the Territorial Support Group and Violent Crime Taskforce. What's not clear is what powers, if any, community groups will have if they think officers have behaved inappropriately. If these measures aren't accompanied by real change, in attitudes and outcomes, they may well be met with a frustrated eye-roll by those who feel they've heard it all before.

"Swedish authorities have said people should prepare for travel restrictions A number of European countries have warned that it is too early to plan for Christmas travel, as coronavirus cases continue to rise across the continent. In Sweden, people have been told to prepare for possible travel restrictions during the holiday period. Meanwhile Irish and French authorities said it was too soon to say if people could make travel arrangements. With six weeks until the festive season, lockdowns and other measures are in force in several countries. Portugal has significantly expanded the number of places subject to a night curfew. From Monday, three-quarters of the country will be under the government's toughest restrictions. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Sweden's top state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told citizens to prepare for the possibility of restricted travel between different areas during the Christmas period so that regional healthcare services could avoid becoming overwhelmed. A provisional decision would likely be made in a week or two, he said, adding that Swedes needed to be prepared that things could still change ""right before Christmas"". Mr Tegnell also said ""the large bulk"" of new Covid-19 cases were currently coming from private parties. He said he hoped a ban on serving alcohol in pubs and bars after 22:00, due to start next weekend, would not lead to a rise in private social gatherings. On Thursday, authorities announced 40 new deaths, the country's highest daily toll for five months. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Prime MinisterLeo Varadkar said he would not yet advise Irish citizens living abroadto book flights home, adding that it was ""too soon"" to give such advice. A similar sentiment was shared by French Prime Minister Jean Castex, who said it was ""too early"" to say whether citizens could buy train tickets to travel at Christmas. He added that there would be no easing of lockdown restrictions for at least two weeks. ""It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now,"" he told a news conference, ""the gains are fragile."" What are the latest rules for international travel? Under the lockdown restrictions, people in France can only leave their homes to go to work if they cannot work from home, to buy essential goods, seek medical help or to exercise for one hour a day. All non-essential shops, restaurants and bars are shut, but schools and creches remain open. Mr Castex added that some shops may be allowed to reopen from 1 December, depending on case numbers. But he said bars and restaurants must remain closed. France is grappling with a sharp rise in cases, with more than 1.9 million confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. On Thursday, French health authorities announced a record-high 32,638 hospitalisations - almost 350 higher than a peak reached in April. But the daily number of new infections was over 2,500 lower than Wednesday, and France's seven-day moving average was down for a fifth day in a row. In Italy, much of the country is in lockdown, but there are calls for stricter measures as the numbers of infections continues to grow. A further 636 deaths were reported on Thursday. Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia said people should celebrate Christmas only with close family members. In the UK,discussions took place about the four nations taking a joint approach to Covid rulesover Christmas. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

The live page has been edited by Emily Young and Martha Buckley, and written by Joseph Lee, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. And here are the latest headlines from around the
world today: We are preparing to close the live page shortly. Here's a reminder of some of the top stories in the UK today: Tulip MazumdarGlobal Health Correspondent Concerns around vaccines is nothing new. But the speed at which Covid-19 candidates are being developed, have made some people - understandably - question how it's possible to make a safe and effective vaccine so fast. It usually takes around a decade to develop a new vaccine, but in less than a year it appears scientists have created at least one for Covid. So how are they doing it? Firstly, they are well-funded - and time is money. Governments around the world, desperate for a way out of this crisis, have ploughed billions of dollars into developing a vaccine. This is unprecedented in such a short space of time. It can take scientists years just to secure funding for their research for other vaccines. With so many people potentially receiving a vaccine, safety has to be the absolute number one priority. There is a very robust international human trials process which establishes the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. The World Health Organization - which is collating all the data from trials for more than 200 vaccine candidates - says safety data cannot and will not be compromised. Studies will also continue even after vaccines are rolled out to keep track of any rare possible side effects. Also, much of what needs to happen to get a successful vaccine out to people all over the world is already under way. For example, hundreds of millions of the most promising vaccine candidates are already being manufactured. This usually only happens when a vaccine is approved for wide use. If the vaccines are found not to be effective or safe enough as trial data continues coming in, they won't be used. But if any of them are - the vaccines will be ready to deploy very quickly.

Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland have now launched an investigation after footage posted online showed people at the Draft Project pop-up bar embracing while celebrating the result. The owner of the bar has now spoken, saying staff were ""unable to prevent or contain what happened"". Stuart Clarkson, owner and founder of PB Devco, which owns the bar, said: ""Having seen the videos I am shocked, disappointed and saddened. ""This simply is not acceptable and I understand why people are so upset by this.""While we are proud of our venues and the safe environment they provide, it is clear that in this case we misjudged what was likely to happen. ""Despite having four additional members of security staff on duty, we were simply unable to contain the outbreak of joy at Scotland's success."" Aberdeen is currently in Level 2 of coronavirus restrictions and rules state no more than two households can mix in pubs. Police said there were no arrests or fixed penalty notices issued in relation to the alleged incident. Read more here. Italy has reported a record 40,902 coronavirus
cases over the past 24 hours and 550 deaths. Earlier this week, the country became the third
nation in mainland Europe to surpass one million cases, after Spain and France. There have been calls for a national lockdown
to help curb the spread of the virus. Italy was one of the worst affected countries
in Europe during the first wave of the pandemic. More than 43,000 people have died there since the
pandemic began. California has become the second US state to
hit one million cases. Texas was the first state to hit the landmark
figure. Both states now have more viral caseloads than countries including
Mexico and Germany. The US reported a record high of 153,496 new
infections on Thursday as well as 919 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins
University. Over 67,000 people are currently in hospital in

Gordon Howat had been in France for the 1998 World Cup, the last major tournament Scotland have competed in. And when the team won on penalties at the Rajko Mitic stadium, he was there too - having been a pitch consultant for Red Star Belgrade since 2017. He joked: ""Sometimes you have to call in a favour and arrange a visit at the right time."" Mr Howat was spotted in the main stand with his saltire by BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin before the match. Mr Howat told him: ""I was lucky enough to be in France for the Brazil game 20-odd years ago. ""It was a great moment. I guess it was just myself and a few guys, like yourself, in the press. ""I'm sure it was big back home in Scotland, despite lockdown."" There have been 27,301 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK, according to thedaily figures released by the government,external. It brings the total - since the pandemic began - to 1,317,496. There have been a further 376 deaths of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. It means 51,304 people have now died, under this measure.  This video can not be played Birmingham care home reunites couple separated by Covid A devoted couple who have been married for 71 years have been reunited in a care home after five weeks apart. Ken Meredith, who has dementia, has been living at Bourn View Care Home in Birmingham for five weeks. His wife Betty was unable to visit him due to the coronavirus pandemic - so decided to move in, so they could be together, without telling her husband. After self-isolating for two weeks, she was allowed to be reunited with him, and the pair were treated to a romantic dinner by care home staff. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The scientists advising the government believe the R number for the UK is between 1 and 1.2, slightly down on last weekâs 1.1-1.3. The worst case, an R of 1.2, means that the epidemic is doubling roughly every four weeks. When the epidemic had been doubling fortnightly through much of the autumn, slower growth is better news. But itâs still growth. The best case, an R of 1, means no growth. That would mean a continuation of about 50,000 cases a day in England, more across the UK, and just over 2,000 coronavirus deaths a week. It is possible that it may be below 1 in the north west of England, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scientists advising the government say we need the epidemic to shrink - for R to be below 1, consistently, before the pressure on hospitals starts to ease. The Australian prime minister said President-elect Joe Biden was ""very interested"" in how Australia has handled the pandemic US President-elect Joe Biden has invited Australia to share its findings about

sending a copy of the National Contact Tracing review to the Biden team as well
as to President Trump. The Australian prime-minister said Mr Biden was
âvery interested in Australiaâs successâ. Australia shut its borders early on into the pandemic and introduced strict measures. The country has recorded more than 27,600 cases and 907 deaths in a country of more than 24 million people. During the election campaign, Mr Biden said he
would âlisten to the scienceâ when it came to tackling the pandemic in the US. The US has recorded 10.5 million cases and more
than 242,000 deaths since the outbreak began. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News Microsoft says it has detectedcyber-attacks from Russia and North Korea targeting seven companies involved in researching vaccines,externaland treatments for Covid-19. The companyâs vice-president, Tom Burt, said in a blog post that the targets included leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada, France, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from one group in Russia and two in North Korea. The ""majority"" of these attacks were said to have been blocked and the companies informed. It is not the first time that states have been accused of targeting vaccine work. In July, the UK saidRussian intelligence was behind the targeting of UK research, including on the Oxford vaccine.The US also accused China of similar activity. All of this is part of a global race for a vaccine as countries seek advantage over each other. Footballer Mo Salah has contracted the virus,

They are the final batch of 30,000 donated to China by Mongoliaâs president, Khaltmaa Battulga, during a visit there in late February, when Wuhan was hard-hit by the virus. It was also in strict lockdown, with residents unable to leave the city, or even their buildings, without special permission. The sheep have been travelling in batches since late October. The official China Daily newspaper says sheep are a âsymbol of wealth and status in Mongoliaâ and that the gift representsâthe best wishes of the Mongolian peopleâ,external. Wuhan was the Chinese city worst hit by the coronavirus. More than 50,000 of the city's 11 million population contracted Covid-10, and some 3,800 people died. It also experiencedheavy flooding during the summer,external, impacting the agricultural sector and leading to fears about winter food shortages. The city is, however, Covid-free now and this week hosted an international health expo,which attracted some 13,000 guests from 34 countries and regions.,external The ad features a cast of characters that includes this pigeon gang The annualJohn Lewis Christmas adhas been revealed - with the boss of the shopping chain saying it wanted something ""appropriate for how we're all feeling at the moment"". It focuses on acts of kindness, inspired by the public spirit shown throughout the pandemic and shows different characters helping other people, with a love heart as a central theme throughout. ""We wanted to have a message out there about thinking of others and helping families in need and people in need,"" John Lewis's Pippa Wicks said. Other big brands have also released their adverts. Coco-Cola and Aldi's ads show loved ones being reunited, while Morrisons and Argos focus on families at home.   YouTubewon't be producing its annual Rewind video, looking back at the previous 12 months, this year. It said in a statement: ""2020 has been different. And it doesn't feel right to carry on as if it weren't."" YouTube has produced a retrospective every year since 2010, featuring big names looking back at some of the year's viral moments. Some have been better received than others however, with the2018 video becoming the most-disliked videoon the platform. And then last year, the format of Rewind was changed, with a compilation of the most-liked videos from 2019 instead. Journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, who writes about YouTube and other social platforms, said it was a shame that Rewind had been cancelled because YouTube had become ""a major source of entertainment and support for people during the pandemic"". But he added: ""There's just not that much new that's come out of YouTube this year. It's been outmoded and overtaken as the place that trends begin, by more nimble apps like TikTok."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The figures from the Office for National Statistics today suggest that infections were stabilising in thefirst week of November. Yesterdayâs figures showed a sharp rise in people testing positivein the middle of this week. So if there is a sharp rise in infections towards the end of last week or early this week, we wouldnât see it in the surveysuntil next Friday. Butone dayâssharp jump doesnât establish a trend, so weâll have to wait for a few more days to know for sure. There are two main long term trends in the data on the virus, and the ONS figures fit into that picture. In the places or people where the virus has risen furthest, places like Northern Ireland, the north west of England or among teenagers and young adults, infections appear to be stabilising or even falling. But it is still rising where it has, to date, made fewer inroads. That is in places like the south of England or in those over the age of 70 who are most likely to become seriously sick. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The number of job adverts posted has risen to levels not seen since before lockdown in March, a study indicates. There were 1.36 million active UK job adverts in the first week of November, according to the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC). However, it said regional disparities were clear, with north-west England and Wales leading the recovery, while London had seen a fall in vacancies. There were more adverts for jobs in nursing than any other sector, it said. Six of the 12 nations and major regions now have higher numbers of job adverts than in March, while six still have fewer, according to the REC. Job postings in the North West jumped 36.8% between March and October, while in Wales, the increase was 33.4%. By contrast, job postings in London saw an 18.7% fall over the same period, with a 9.3% decline in the West Midlands. ""One of the most interesting developments we are seeing in terms of employer demand is the 'London lag', which is seeing the capital return to pre-lockdown levels at a much slower rate than other regions of the country,"" said Matthew Mee, director of workforce intelligence at Emsi, which worked on the survey in partnership with the REC. ""When we couple this with the fact that furlough take-up has been higher in London than elsewhere, and that the highest rise in claimant counts has been in the London commuter belt, it seems that the restrictions since March may well have had a greater proportionate impact on the capital than on other regions of the country."" The report also identified several sectors where demand for workers was rising. Nurses were highly sought after as the coronavirus pandemic continued to spread, with 112,149 active job postings - more than any other sector and an increase of 39% since March. There was also an increase in vacancies for food, drink and tobacco process operatives (+53.2%), large goods vehicle drivers (+43.3%) and carpenters and joiners (+37.2%). However, the hospitality and leisure sectors saw big declines, with fewer adverts for bar staff (-48.7%), chefs (-45.6%) and fitness instructors (-36.8%). Figures released on Tuesday showedthe unemployment rate rose to 4.8%in the three months to September, up from 4.5%. ""Unemployment and redundancy numbers earlier this week showed that this is a tough moment for our jobs market,"" said REC boss Neil Carberry. ""But we also know that there are always jobs being created by those businesses who can, and as this data reveals, there is hope to be found in many places and sectors.""

"Fresh figures shows black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched in a car than a white person Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for police traffic stops to be reviewed to look at whether black people are disproportionately affected by some police tactics. The year-long pilot scheme forms part of an Action Plan published by City Hall to help improve trust in the Met. It comes as Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick admitted the Met ""is not free from racism or discrimination"". Mr Khan said ""more must be done and will be done through this Action Plan"". City Hall published the report to look at concerns that black Londoners are disproportionately affected by policing powers. New data shows black people are four times more likely to be stopped and searched in public than a white person. They are also six times more likely to be stopped in their vehicles, according to City Hall. The mayor wants communities to scrutinise such policing tactics to improve trust and confidence in the Met. He has set aside Â£1.7m to improve police training and a drive on recruiting more black officers, with the force is aiming for 40% of new recruits to be from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds from 2022. Natalie Bennett was stopped by police while driving in Wandsworth Natalie Bennett was driving in Wandsworth last year when she was stopped by police who believed she might be hiding drugs or stolen goods. The Met apologised for its actions, but Ms Bennett said she was left terrified by the experience and still had nightmares. ""Every time I see a police car, a marked car, or a police officer... I can literally feel my heart going through my whole body,"" she said. The nurse told the BBC she believed there was a ""significant difference when you see how the police approach black people to when they approach white people. ""Why is that? Is this about unconscious biases that are deep-seated inside these officers which need to be addressed?"" Progress has been made by the Met since the Macpherson Inquiry more than 20 years ago, following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, Mr Khan said. There are now more than 5,000 BAME officers in the force - up from just over 3,000 a decade ago. ""[But] it's simply not right that Black Londoners have less trust and confidence in our police service,"" Mr Khan said. ""It's something I am determined to resolve. ""More must be done - and will be done through this Action Plan - properly to recognise and address the impact that some police tactics used disproportionately on black people is having. ""This starts with involving communities and ensuring they have proper oversight and scrutiny of stop and search, the use of Tasers and the use of force, as well as in the training of new police officers so they can better understand the trauma that the disproportionate use of police powers can have on black Londoners."" Met Police 'uses force more' against black people Black men 'stopped and searched over fist bump' City Hall said the Met Police ""welcomed"" the plan and was committed to talking on the points raised. Dame Cressida said the Met had ""zero tolerance of racism"" but she admitted that the force ""is not free of discrimination, racism or bias"". ""I am committed to redoubling our efforts to deliver a better service for, and with, black Londoners, to doing all we can to help them be safe, and to increase their trust in us,"" she said. Katharine Carpenter, BBC London Home Affairs correspondent A City Hall source has described the new measures as ""the most significant changes to policing and black communities since The Macpherson Report"". They certainly indicate that the mayor and Met have been listening to Londoners' concerns about the disproportionate use of force on black people and an apparent lack of accountability. Across the capital, Community Monitoring Groups already scrutinise officers' use of stop and search, but members of the organisation London Citizens, who were consulted on Mr Khan's plan, told me they particularly welcomed the chance to probe the actions of the Territorial Support Group and Violent Crime Taskforce. What's not clear is what powers, if any, community groups will have if they think officers have behaved inappropriately. If these measures aren't accompanied by real change, in attitudes and outcomes, they may well be met with a frustrated eye-roll by those who feel they've heard it all before.

"Troops loyal to the government ride in trucks to face Tigray People's Liberation Front forces ""Scores and probably hundreds"" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says. Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved. Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week. Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict. There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces. As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp. In a statement it said it could confirm that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November"". It had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"". This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a ""horrific tragedy"" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access. Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi. The UN has said thatvital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopiaare at risk because of the conflict there. In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control. He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of ""cruelty"", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they ""found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied"". The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked. There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains. The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party. Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption. Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run.

"Peter Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women The Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has died at the age of 74. The serial killer was serving a whole life term for murdering 13 women across Yorkshire and north-west England. His first victim's son, who was five when his mother was killed in 1975, said Sutcliffe's death would bring ""some kind of closure"". The former lorry driver, from Bradford, died in hospital where he is said to have refused treatment for Covid-19. He also had other health problems. Sutcliffe, who was also found guilty of the attempted murder of seven women, was convicted in 1981.  He spent three decades at Broadmoor Hospital before being moved to HMP Frankland in County Durham in 2016. This video can not be played Speaking before an apology from police, Richard McCann, the son of Peter Sutcliffe's first victim, Wilma McCann, reacts to his death Ex-police officer Bob Bridgestock, who worked on the case, said he ""won't be shedding any tears"" over the killer's death. The murders, which spanned five years from 1975 to 1980, began with 28-year-old mother-of-four Wilma McCann, who was hit with a hammer and stabbed 15 times, in October 1975. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times during the course of a huge investigation but continued to avoid arrest and was able to carry on killing.

Yorkshire Ripper's death 'should focus on victims' Yorkshire Ripper killings created 'culture of fear' BBC crime reporter recalls hunt for killer He explained that in about 2010 he had decided to let go of his anger and ""forgive"" Sutcliffe. ""I am sorry to hear he has passed away. It's not something I could have said in the past when I was consumed with anger,"" he said. Wilma McCann was the first woman Sutcliffe murdered, in 1975 Sutcliffe was dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper because he mutilated his victims' bodies. He is said to have believed he was on a ""mission from God"" to kill prostitutes, although not all of his victims were sex workers. Yorkshire Ripper death: Latest updates Was Sutcliffe involved in Sweden murders? One of his surviving victims said that 40 years on she is still affected by the attack as she walked home from a pub in Leeds in October 1980. Mo Lea, who was 20 at the time, said she had written Sutcliffe a letter while he was in prison. ""I was compelled to write to let him know how the fact that he was hanging on to the knowledge that he tried to kill me, was affecting me,"" she said. ""And I thought at least if I post it I'll know that in some way there'll be a level of understanding. I didn't expect a response and I didn't get one but it felt good to put it in the post box."" A huge police operation was launched to find Sutcliffe An inquiry held after his conviction said a backlog of case paperwork meant officers were unable to connect vital pieces of information. The first two victims, Ms McCann and Emily Jackson, were killed in Chapeltown, which was known at the time for containing Leeds' main red light district. Following the second murder, West Yorkshire Police announced they were looking for a ""prostitute killer"", leading to accusations key eyewitness evidence was being ignored as it did not fit detectives' narrative. The investigation was also misdirected by one of criminal history's cruellest hoaxes, when John Humble tricked police into believing the serial killer was a man dubbed Wearside Jack because of his gruff Sunderland accent. Police had believed he was the killer despite some survivors of attacks by Sutcliffe reporting he had a Yorkshire accent. Humble, who died in 2019, never fully explained why he taunted detectives with letters and an infamous tape recording, in which he anonymously claimed to be the serial killer. George Oldfield, centre, with detectives who initially believed the hoax tape was genuine West Yorkshire Police detectives, headed by the then assistant chief constable George Oldfield, believed the letters and tape were genuine and diverted crucial resources to the north-east of England. When Humble was eventually prosecuted, Leeds Crown Court heard claims the delays caused by the hoax left Peter Sutcliffe free to murder three more women. This video can not be played When arrested in 2005 Humble read aloud a section of the hoax tape he sent to police in 1979 Sutcliffe had violently attacked at least three women before he killed Ms McCann. In 1969, he hit a woman over the head with a stone in a sock. Sutcliffe admitted the offence, but his victim decided not to press charges. Six years later, just months before Ms McCann's death, he attacked two other women with a knife and a hammer but both survived. Sutcliffe attended Dewsbury Magistrates Court in February 1981 charged with the murder of 13 women and attempted murder of seven others Mr Oldfield's 200-strong ripper squad eventually carried out more than 130,000 interviews, visited more than 23,000 homes and checked 150,000 cars. But Joan Smith, a radio reporter in Manchester who interviewed some of the surviving victims before Sutcliffe was caught, said there were instances of ""the most blatant victim blaming"" from detectives. ""There were no women involved in this case at all - all the detectives were male, virtually all the reporters were maleâ¦ I felt that right from the beginning women didn't have a voice,"" she said. ""I don't think any woman who was around in the north of England at that time will ever be able to hear his name without some kind of shudder."" Sutcliffe died at the University Hospital of North Durham after being transferred there from maximum security HMP Frankland Mr McCann has appealed to West Yorkshire Police to make a formal apology for the language used in the 1970s to describe his mother and other victims. ""They described some of the women as 'innocent', inferring that some were not innocent - including my mum,"" he said. ""She was a family woman who, through no fault of her own, was going through adversity and made some bad decisions, some risky decisions. ""She paid for those decisions with her life."" A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ""We have received correspondence from Mr McCann and commit to continue to engage with him directly."" Angry crowds gathered outside Dewsbury Magistrates' Court when Sutcliffe appeared there following his arrest A stroke of luck eventually led to Sutcliffe's arrest when his brown Rover car, which had false number plates, was stopped by police in a red light area of Sheffield in January 1981. Mr Bridgestock, who was one of the first on the scene when Josephine Whitaker was murdered in 1979, said senior detectives ""wore blinkers"" while leading the inquiry.

"Peter Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women The Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has died at the age of 74. The serial killer was serving a whole life term for murdering 13 women across Yorkshire and north-west England. His first victim's son, who was five when his mother was killed in 1975, said Sutcliffe's death would bring ""some kind of closure"". The former lorry driver, from Bradford, died in hospital where he is said to have refused treatment for Covid-19. He also had other health problems. Sutcliffe, who was also found guilty of the attempted murder of seven women, was convicted in 1981.  He spent three decades at Broadmoor Hospital before being moved to HMP Frankland in County Durham in 2016. This video can not be played Speaking before an apology from police, Richard McCann, the son of Peter Sutcliffe's first victim, Wilma McCann, reacts to his death Ex-police officer Bob Bridgestock, who worked on the case, said he ""won't be shedding any tears"" over the killer's death. The murders, which spanned five years from 1975 to 1980, began with 28-year-old mother-of-four Wilma McCann, who was hit with a hammer and stabbed 15 times, in October 1975. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times during the course of a huge investigation but continued to avoid arrest and was able to carry on killing. Twelve of the 13 women Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering: Emily Jackson, Irene Richardson, Patricia Atkinson, Jayne McDonald, Jean Jordan, Yvonne Pearson, Helen Rytka, Vera Millward, Josephine Whittaker, Barbara Leach, Marguerite Walls, Jacqueline Hill (Wilma McCann pictured below) Wilma McCann, 28, Leeds, October 1975 Emily Jackson, 42, Leeds, January 1976 Irene Richardson, 28, Leeds, February 1977 Patricia Atkinson, 32, Bradford, April 1977 Jayne McDonald, 16, Leeds, June 1977 Jean Jordan, 21, Manchester, October 1977 Yvonne Pearson, 22, Bradford, January 1978 Helen Rytka, 18, Huddersfield, January 1978 Vera Millward, 41, Manchester, May 1978 Josephine Whittaker, 19, Halifax, May 1979 Barbara Leach, 20, Bradford, September 1979 Marguerite Walls, 47, Leeds, August 1980 Jacqueline Hill, 20, Leeds, November 1980 Ms McCann's son Richard said: ""The attention he's had over the years, the continuous news stories that we've suffered over the years, there is some form of conclusion to that.

"Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended for one more week with a partial reopening of some sectors next Friday, in a compromise reached by the executive. A proposal from DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds was supported by the Ulster Unionists and Alliance. Sinn FÃ©in voted against the move and the SDLP abstained. It means close contact services and unlicensed premises can reopen on Friday, 20 November. Hair and beauty salons and driving instructors will reopen, by appointment, next Friday. Hospitality will reopen on a ""graduated basis"", with unlicensed premises such as cafes and coffee shops also opening on 20 November, but with a closing time of 20:00 GMT. Alcohol cannot be purchased or consumed on such premises. Pubs and bars will be permitted to sell sealed off sales on 20 November. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November, as the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced on 16 October will expire at midnight on 26 November. The currentrestrictions came into effect on 16 Octoberand were due to expire at midnight on Friday, with ministers under pressure to make a decision. The latest paper, brought by the DUP after several days of disagreement, was signed off late on Thursday afternoon. Close contact services including hair salons will reopen, by appointment, on 20 November The document agreed also says that support will be provided for mitigations to reduce risk within the hospitality sector, including improved ventilation and requirements for the recording of customer information for contact tracing purposes. The executive said a vaccination programme will be rolled out from as early as possible in December in line with England, initially targeting priority groups such as health care staff, care homes and those with underlying vulnerabilities. Justice Minister Naomi Long said she wasreconsidering her position in the Northern Ireland Executive over its handling of the Covid restrictions. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance initially supported a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to extend all Covid-19 restrictions for another two weeks, butit was blocked by the DUP,who put it to a cross-community vote. It is a mechanism that can be deployed on any issue in the executive, if three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis, effectively giving parties with enough ministers a veto. The NI Executive is made up of five parties that operate in a mandatory coalition, sharing power between unionist and nationalist parties, and the cross-community Alliance Party - tensions had been flaring between ministers throughout the four days of meetings. A separate proposal put forward by Mr Swann, suggesting a one-week extension, was also blocked on Wednesday. The DUP had been calling for firm dates to be announced for other sectors to reopen, but other parties argued providing concrete dates to businesses during an unpredictable pandemic would be ""unfair"". Talks continued between the parties on Thursday over a hybrid proposal merging the one-week extension with a partial reopening of sectors the DUP had been calling for. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan. She told BBC Newsline that only imposing one more week of restrictions ""potentially means we're coming back to this situation before Christmas"". Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she could not ""in good conscience"" support the plan ""We had strong advice from the chief medical officer and that should have been adhered to."" Economy Minister Diane Dodds said what the DUP had tried to do in their proposal ""is to bring certainty to people in their lives in the run-up to Christmas"". ""We have tried to bring forward a proposal that is balanced, that is proportionate and which the health minister supported, because that is the only way forward for an executive of five parties,"" she said. Mrs Dodds added: ""We cannot have a situation where we simply just open up business, close down business, open up business and we keep that in a perpetual cycle."" She later told BBC One's The View programme that she did not believe the executive had ""covered itself in glory"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds the DUP has tried to 'bring certainty to people' In a tweet, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said a ""fair and balanced agreement"" had been reached with the support of the health minister.

SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon abstained on the vote as she said she feared it could lead to more restrictions just before Christmas. ""People were crying out for a decision,"" she said. ""And I'm being honest, I could support the extension for the one week, I could support additional finances going to businesses, but I couldn't support the partial reopening in the second week, and the best way and most honest way for me to reflect that was by abstaining on the vote."" Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: ""That an agreement that could have been reached over a week ago has finally been achieved this evening is hardly a startling example of good and effective government."" He added: ""The lack of leadership from the Executive Office, the leaking and the briefing, as well as the use of cross-community voting within the Executive on matters that are anything but, further reinforces our belief that the system of government here needs urgent reform."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said it had been ""an embarrassing week of misgovernment"". Chief Executive of Belfast Chamber, Simon Hamilton, described the wrangling at Stormont as an ""embarrassing mess"". Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation told BBC One's The View programme that 35% of hotel rooms in Northern Ireland had been booked this weekend. She said 3,000 phone calls had to be made on Thursday after the Executive made a decision to keep hotels closed for two more weeks. She added: ""What many people forget is we had brides who are getting married this Saturday on the phone this afternoon asking could they get married."" Allow Twitter content?

Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said he hoped the announcement would ""result in thousands of jobs and businesses being saved"". ""While pubs and restaurants may be closed, the bills continue to mount on a daily basis therefore extra financial support is needed now to protect businesses and jobs and we hope that the NI Executive will be swift in getting this money into bank accounts."" What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the package of restrictions was ""far from perfect"" - but welcomed that a decision had been taken. ""This decision provides a roadmap for the reopening of our high streets for the Christmas period and increased footfall for local retailers,"" he said. However, Bill Wolsey, who owns the Beannchor Group, said the decision came ""late in they day"" and was ""hugely disappointing"". He said the hospitality industry is now ""in a dire position"", and it was costing his company Â£30,000 a week in wages to stay closed. He said being open at Christmas is ""hugely important"". ""That's not only for my company, but for the whole of our industry - we use that money we make in December to sustain us through January and February, which are very quiet months. That's why we're so concerned about on what basis we'll be allowed to open."" Claire Blackadder, a hairdresser from Newry, told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra the announcement her business could reopen next Friday was ""absolutely brilliant"". ""At least now the ball is rolling in that regard, we just need finance now and we are good to go,"" she added. This week was a hard lesson in how not to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. What we have seen is a slow moving, five-party government trying to deal with a fast-moving situation, and it was quite clear this week that they failed on all fronts, given the level of frustration among the public. Despite the fact that there is now an agreement in place, few people are pleased with what is on the table. The big loser in all of this is the public messaging - while our politicians spent a lot of time and energy trying to convince each other about what was the right thing to do, they lost valuable time trying to convince the public that they need to comply with regulations. Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear that if he feels there needs to be a review in the next fortnight, he will be prepared to bring a recommendation for further restrictions to the executive table, so pubs and restaurants may not be out of the woods just yet. While pubs and restaurants might be circling 27 November on their calendar, they also know that there is a possibility they may not get to that point without further intervention.

"More than 800 police officers in the UK have tested positive for Covid since the pandemic began, new figures show. Across 24 of the UK's 45 police forces who supplied figures, 849 out of 77,000 officers have had a positive test. The police have been tasked with ensuring the public follow the government's coronavirus restrictions. The Police Federation said officers were in ""constant worry"" when confronting offenders who might spit, bite or cough at them. What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid-related assaults on police increasing The new figures, obtained through freedom of information requests by the Press Association news agency, show there have been positive tests for 228 officers from Police Scotland, 101 from West Midlands Police and 95 from Greater Manchester Police. Merseyside Police's chief constable Andy Cooke, who tested positive in March, was among 62 people to have contracted the virus at the force. There are about 153,000 police officers in total in the UK. However, the figures do not include the Metropolitan Police, the UK's largest force, and the other 20 forces who did not respond to the information request. Anyone whotests positive for the virus has to self-isolate for at least 10 days.,external John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation, said it was ""inevitable"" some officers would catch the virus given the nature of their work. He said: ""There is the constant worry of bringing the virus home to their loved ones, which is exacerbated when they deal with offenders who weaponise the virus by spitting, biting and coughing - which is disgusting and unacceptable.

"The US Commerce Department has halted a ban on TikTok that was due to come into effect on Thursday night. The order would have prevented the app from being downloaded in the US. The Commerce Department delayed the ban ""pending further legal developments,"" citing a Philadelphia court ruling from September where three prominent TikTokers had argued the app should be allowed to operate in America. The decision will be a relief to the estimated 100 million US TikTok users. In September, TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance announced a deal with Walmart and Oracle to shift TikTok's US assets into a new entity called TikTok Global. Donald Trump tentatively supported the deal. However on Tuesday TikTok said it had had no feedback from the US government in two months. President Trump has said he wants TikTok to be sold to a US company. Both he, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have repeatedly said that the data of US users could be passed on to the Chinese government, though no evidence has been presented showing this.

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has said he acted reasonably and legally after driving 260 miles from his home to Durham during lockdown. What did he do and what does the guidance say? Mr Cummings was seen on Downing Street on 14 April 23 March:The prime ministertells the UK public they ""must stay at home"". People are warned not to meet friends or family members they do not live with. Those with symptoms had already been told to self-isolate. 27 March: Mr Cummingsis seen leaving 10 Downing Street,external.  ""I suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four-year-old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill.""  He went home, but after a couple of hours his wife felt better and he returned to work. Guidance:If Mr Cummings believed his wife may have had coronavirus, the guidance was that""all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days"",external. What are social distancing and self-isolation rules? Evening:Mr Cummings went on to explain - ""That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife. She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever."" Mr Cummings saidmany people he worked closely with, including the PM, had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms. He said: ""I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease."" Later:Mr Cummings drove up to Durham with his family, arriving ""at roughly midnight"". ""I was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid. ""My wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier."" Mr Cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child. Guidance:Stay at home is the simple government advice,externalfor households where one or more members have coronavirus symptoms. However, the main advice page says it is not always straightforward when children are involved. It says: ""If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible."" Other government advice did not contain this caveat, such as the leaflet drawn up at the end of March to be sent to every house. Nor did the government page onessential travel,externalwhich said: ""Essential travel does not include visits to second homes... whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence."" Durham Police said on 28 May that it did not consider that going to Durham had been an offence. The police statement stressed that it was concerned with whether Mr Cummings had breached the regulations, not the general government guidance to ""stay at home"". What are the lockdown rules for caring for children? Coronavirus: Can it affect eyesight? Kuenssberg: Questions remain 28 March:Mr Cummings says he woke up ""in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever"". 30 March:A No 10 source confirmed Mr Cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating ""at home"". 1 April:Durham Constabulary speak to the father of Dominic Cummings who confirms that his son and family were present at the property. 2 April:During the night, Mr Cummings' four-year-old son ""threw up and had a bad fever"". Following medical advice, an ambulance took the child to hospital. He was accompanied by Mr Cummings' wife. Mr Cummings ""could barely stand up"". 3 April:After being taken to hospital, Mr Cummings' son woke up the next day having recovered. He was tested for coronavirus and his mother, who was with him at the hospital, was told ""they should return home"" (the test result arrived days later and was negative). According to Mr Cummings, there were no taxis so he ""drove to the hospital, picked him up and returned home"". He said he ""did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody on this short trip"". But according to his wife's later article in the Spectator Mr Cummings had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs throughout this period. Guidance:People with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus and who do not require hospital treatment are told they ""must remain at home until they are well"". In March and April, the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected Covid-19 but without a confirmed test result. A spokesperson for Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area, told the BBC they ""could arrange ambulance transport via North East Ambulance Service"" in early April. 6 April:At some point in the week leading up to this date, Mr Cummings discussed his decision to travel to Durham with the prime minister. ""When we were both sick and in bed,"" he said, ""I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail."" 4-11 April:Mr Cummings said ""after I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house"". He confirmed he, his wife and his son went for a walk into woods owned by his father and it was at this point he was seen by passers-by but his family ""had no interaction with them"". The exact date is not clear but his second week isolating in Durham would have between these two dates. Guidance:Advice concerning outdoor exercise changed during the second week in April, when Mr Cummings and his family walked in the woods. Until9 April, people with coronavirus symptoms and their household were told they could exercise outdoors. On that date,the PHE advice changed to say ""any exercise should be taken within your home"",external. A separate NHS guidance page said people isolating could use their gardens. 11 April:Believing he had recovered by this date, albeit ""feeling weak and exhausted"", Mr Cummings said he ""sought expert medical advice"". ""I explained our family's symptoms and all the timings and asked if it was safe to return to work on Monday or Tuesday, seek childcare and so on. I was told that it was safe and I could return to work."" 12 April: Mr Cummings drives to Barnard Castle, about 25 miles from his parents' home in Durham, with his wife and child. He explained this episode as needing to test his driving was fine before making the long drive back to London. He said he'd been having problems with his vision. Guidance:On 28 May Durham Police said the drive to Barnard Castle""might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention"". It added that the offence was minor because there did not appear to have been any breach of the social distancing rules. The statement said that if an officer had stopped Mr Cummings on the way to Barnard Castle, they would advised him to return to Durham. The constabulary said it would not be taking retrospective action against him because it would not do so against any other member of the public. There was no mention in the statement of whether Mr Cummings was fit to drive given his concerns about his eyesight. The1988 Road Traffic Act,externalsays: ""If a person drives a motor vehicle on a road while his eyesight is such (whether through a defect which cannot be, or one which is not for the time being, sufficiently corrected) that he cannot comply with any requirement as to eyesight prescribed under this Part of this Act for the purposes of tests of competence to drive, he is guilty of an offence."" TheHighway Code,externalsays: ""You MUST report to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) any health condition likely to affect your driving."" Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable of Manchester Police, said the drive to Barnard Castle was potentially a criminal offence. ""It's not the way to test your eyesight and put, potentially, other people in danger.""On Twitter, John Apter, chair of the Police Federation for England and Wales,external, said: ""If you're feeling unwell and your eyesight may be impaired do not drive your vehicle to test your ability to drive. It's not a wise move."" Michael Gove also referred to a reason that Mr Cummings did not during his press conference. ""It was part of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well."" In the NPCC guidance referred to by Mr Gove - which was publicised in mid-April - ""driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise"" was deemed not likely to be reasonable. Mr Cummings and his family walked a few yards and sat by a riverbank for a few minutes. 13 April:Mr Cummings and his family travel back to London. 14 April:Mr Cummings is seen in Downing Street for the first time since 27 March. In his recent press conference Mr Cummings said he had written ""about the possible threat from coronaviruses last year"" but it transpired anold blog was editedon the evening of 14 April to add a short section on this. 19 April:Five days after being in London, The Observer and Mirror report that Mr Cummings is seen again in Durham by an unnamed witness. Mr Cummings says he did not return to Durham and that evidence on his phone proves this. This video can not be played Dominic Cummings' full statement on lockdown row Mr Cummings insisted he did not break the law, saying: ""I believe that in all the circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in Number 10."" He said ""I don't regret what I did"" and added that ""the rules make clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and the situation I was in was exceptional circumstances"".

"The US Commerce Department has halted a ban on TikTok that was due to come into effect on Thursday night. The order would have prevented the app from being downloaded in the US. The Commerce Department delayed the ban ""pending further legal developments,"" citing a Philadelphia court ruling from September where three prominent TikTokers had argued the app should be allowed to operate in America. The decision will be a relief to the estimated 100 million US TikTok users. In September, TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance announced a deal with Walmart and Oracle to shift TikTok's US assets into a new entity called TikTok Global. Donald Trump tentatively supported the deal. However on Tuesday TikTok said it had had no feedback from the US government in two months. President Trump has said he wants TikTok to be sold to a US company. Both he, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have repeatedly said that the data of US users could be passed on to the Chinese government, though no evidence has been presented showing this. TikTok denies the allegations. The app is already banned in India, after a diplomatic spat with China. TikTok couldn't be reached for comment.

"This video can not be played Jessica says she thought she was going to die A mother trapped with her children when an explosion ripped through their house has spoken of the terrifying moment she could hear them screaming. Jessica Williams, and her two boys aged five and two, were inside their home inSeven Sisters, Neath Port Talbot, when it collapsed on 24 June. Both children suffered severe burns, and Jessica was placed in a coma for a month. Now Jessica has thanked neighbours who rescued her children. After hearing her screaming, neighbours rushed into the family's home on Church Street, and pulled the two children from the rubble. Jessica Williams managed to pull herself from under an American-style fridge which fell on her when the house collapsed ""When you look at the state that the house was in, to think that we all survived, it's just a miracle really. I'm just grateful that we're all here,"" she said. Reuben, five and Elliott, two, both suffered burns to around 28% of their bodies, while their mother had to be placed in an induced coma for a month. After 14 weeks in Morriston Hospital, Jessica - known as Jess - is now back with her family, and is determined to get back to full strength and one day to the family home. This video can not be played Jeff Davies described being one of the first at the scene She remembers everything about the blast, which South Wales Police has said was most likely caused by ageing LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) equipment and the hot weather. On 24 June, she had been enjoying the summer sunshine with her two children. ""We had a lovely morning, they had great fun. Elliott napped on the way home and then we stopped at the house,"" she said. There was nothing to suggest anything was wrong, until she opened the front door of their home, and the smell of gas was ""overwhelming"". ""I did panic slightly, so I sat them on the sofa and told them not to move,"" she said. ""I'm so glad I did, I just went to the oven. I can't really remember if it was ignited or not, but I went to turn the dial... and it just blew up straight away. ""It was so instant, I didn't have time to do anything differently. As soon as I turned it, it just blew up and threw me to the floor. ""Looking back I probably shouldn't have touched it, but I think when you're in a state of panic, you just do stuff, you don't really think do you? You just do it."" The community have vowed to rebuild the family's home for free after finding out it was uninsured Trapped under a large American-style fridge which had fallen in the explosion, Jessica could hear her children screaming, but could not move. ""Hearing the boys scream was so awful, because I couldn't get them,"" she said. ""A load of men just ran in the house, I was just screaming, I literally thought, 'that's it, I'm going to die right here'."" 'There was a massive bang and a plume of dust and smoke blew up' Blast-hit homes to be 'rebuilt through kindness' The group of men, who she would later discover were neighbours, raced into the house, and tried to pull some of the rubble off her, but she was screaming for her children and just wanted them to be safe. ""There was a tiny little gap which I managed to push myself out of, because I just wanted to get out of there I was so scared,"" she said. Remarkably, despite most of her body being covered in burns, Jessica managed to pull herself out of the rubble and stagger into her back garden. ""We had a load of steps up the back and I don't know how, but I managed to walk up them all to someone's house,"" she said. ""As far as myself and everyone around me was aware, it was just the burns to my skin, because I think I was bleeding and there were bits of skin hanging off me...so I didn't know there was anything internally wrong at the time. ""I could talk, I was breathing fine, I walked OK, I walked up the back garden with my flip-flops on and there were neighbours that were hosing me down, trying to sort the burns out until the emergency services arrived."" Jessica said her fiance Michael had been amazing caring for the children with their burns She was taken to Morriston Hospital to be treated in the specialised burns unit, while her two sons were airlifted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her condition deteriorated so rapidly in the ambulance that she was placed in an induced coma on arrival, one she would not wake up from for a month. As well as the burns from the explosion, she had broken ribs, a punctured lung and her kidneys were failing. At that time, her terrified father asked the surgeons what his daughter needed in order to get through her ordeal. ""Luck"" was their reply. Meanwhile, after recovering well, Reuben and Elliott were discharged from hospital before their mother woke up. ""It was quite a blessing really that I was in a coma during the time I was in hospital because if I was just lying there I'd be losing my mind thinking how are they,"" she said. Jessica is recovering at home with her family and says she is determined that life will get back to how it was before the blast When she finally woke up, she was totally unaware of the extent of the damage to her home until she was shown photographs. ""Because I was in the kitchen I could only see the damage to the kitchen, as far as I was aware the rest of the house was OK,"" she said. ""Little did I know it was absolutely ruined. ""I was really upset. It's not what I expected to see at all. It was my house, you know? To think my whole house was just rubble, it was awful to see, really awful."" This video can not be played A building firm and local people rallied around the family Since the explosion, the community has rallied around in an attempt to rebuild the house, which was not insured, as well as two neighbouring properties. One company, Ian Davies Plant Ltd, cleared the rubble ""totally free of charge"" to help the family. ""The men that were actually clearing everything said it would normally take about three days to clear up but it actually took him three weeks because he tried to go through everything he could to salvage important stuff for us,"" said Jessica. She said the workers had recovered toys and photos of treasured memories from the wreckage, and she could not thank the community enough. ""I just can't say enough thank yous to people, we've had so many donations. I'm just blown away by all the support really, it's been amazing,"" she said. The boys were sat on the sofa when the explosion ripped through the house Ms Williams said the support from her friends and family had been incredible, especially from her fiance Michael, who spent days visiting the boys in hospital while worrying about her. More than a dozen neighbours helped pull the family from the house - by a stroke of luck, many of them happened to be retired or retained firefighters. ""I haven't met them, but I have messaged them just to say thank you because at the end of the day, they didn't know if something else was going to happen in the house, and they've risked their lives really coming in to help me,"" she said. ""I was literally screaming for help. If nobody had come, I don't know how long we would have been there for. I'm just so, so grateful for them coming to help me."" Burns and injuries have left Jessica unable to move her right hand properly After 14 weeks in hospital, Jessica went home to her fiance and her two sons in October, but with their home still in ruins they are living in a relative's house. While she is recovering well, she knows she faces severe challenges. ""A lot of it is building my strength back now and getting my energy levels back,"" she said. ""I lost all my muscle tone. So I've had to learn to walk again, move my arms, everything really. I'm just trying to do little bits to get my movement back in my arms and my legs."" In hospital, doctors also performed a tracheostomy, where a small opening is cut in the throat to allow air to enter the lungs. Jessica had to learn how to swallow, eat and talk again. Her hearing was also badly damaged by the explosion, and doctors have said it might not return fully. Fourteen houses were evacuated after the explosion Before the explosion, Ms Williams worked as a pre-school leader at Ysgol Golwg y Cwm in Ystradgynlais, where her sons have now returned to school. But despite struggling to move her right hand, she is determined to regain her strength and mobility, and get back to work and running around after the children again. ""It's going to take time to come to terms with everything, and our lives have completely changed,"" she said. ""That's a big thing to come to terms with, but I just think that we can rebuild our lives now and I'm positive that we can get back to happy times and move on and look to the future."" On top of her physical challenges, she has also had to come to terms with the change in her appearance. ""It is really difficult. If somebody had told me last year 'you're going to have loads of burn injuries', I'd have been devastated, and seeing them all for the first time at the hospital was really really hard,"" she said. ""It was so upsetting. But I'm just grateful really for being here."" ""The boys are improving, I'm improving and I'm just happy that it's the best outcome we could have had really."" Jessica hopes to one day move back to the family home As for the house on Church Road, she said she was not yet ready to go back and see it, but at some point she does want to move home. ""I have passed it in the car which was really difficult. I haven't stopped there yet, because I just think that's a little bit too much for me at the minute,"" she added. ""We're going to try our best to live there because at the end of the day that's our home and that's where we were happy. Until I'm there, I don't know how we're going to feel.""

"This video can not be played Five years after the attacks Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and French PM Jean Castex laid wreaths to mark the attacks France is holding ceremonies for the victims of the 2015 Paris attacks, carried out by Islamic State (IS) militants. The shootings and bombings left 130 dead and 350 wounded - the worst peacetime atrocity in decades. The gunmen who stormed a rock concert at the Bataclan theatre killed 90 people, opening fire on fans packed in to hear the band Eagles of Death Metal. Five years on, France is back on high alert after more jihadist attacks. Three groups of Islamist extremists launched co-ordinated attacks on the Stade de France stadium and popular venues in central Paris in 2015. Last month history teacher Samuel Paty was murdered near his school in the Paris suburbs. Three people died days later in another ""lone wolf"" attack at a church in the southern city of Nice. Grief in Nice after church knife attack 'My brother's life isn't defined by Paris attack' President Emmanuel Macron drew fierce criticism from some Muslims for defending France's state secularism -laÃ¯citÃ© -including the controversial Muhammad cartoons by Charlie Hebdo magazine. Two people were attacked with a meat cleaver outside the magazine's old offices in late September. Charlie Hebdo itself was attacked in January 2015 by two jihadist gunmen, who murdered 12 people, including cartoonists. Police shot and killed the gunmen later. This video can not be played Amelie, a Bataclan survivor: ''It was a bloodbath'' (from 2015) Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Prime Minister Jean Castex, along with other ministers and representatives of victims' organisations are visiting the sites of the attacks and laying flowers. The first ceremony was at the Stade de France, where the attacks began. There are fewer public mourners this year because of the coronavirus lockdown. At 20:00 (19:00 GMT) the Eiffel Tower's lights will go out - then on the hour during the night it will briefly sparkle, in honour of the victims. There will be a special classical concert at 20:30 (19:30 GMT)  by the Philharmonie de Paris, with music composed as a tribute to the victims by Lebanese poet-composer Bechara El-Khoury. It was commissioned by Louise Albertini, whose son StÃ©phane was one of the victims of the Bataclan attack.The concert will be broadcast on Philharmonie Live,externaland Arte Concert. Eagles of Death Metal lead singer Jesse Hughes has spoken of how he almost ""became French"" on the night of the Bataclan attack. ""I can almost feel the physical presence of those people I love so much - those who died, who were wounded, who survived, who helped and all their families,"" he told Le Parisien. At the gates of the Stade de France three jihadists detonated their explosive beltsbetween 21:20 and 21:53, during a capacity-crowd football match between France and Germany. A Portuguese coach driver died in that attack, besides the bombers, while the crowd was locked inside the stadium until the match ended. The rampage then continued in the streets of central Paris. A second group of three jihadists drove through the 10th and 11th districts in a black Seat car, opening fire at people having drinks and dinner outside bars and restaurants. The first shooting happened at21:25. Half an hour of assault rifle bursts resulted in 39 deaths. One of the gunmen later blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe. The third jihadist group - again three gunmen - stormed the Bataclan theatre. The shooting began at21:40and the carnage did not stop until elite anti-terror police managed to corner two of the three in an assault at00:18. Just before22:00a policeman shot and killed one gunman downstairs whose suicide belt exploded. The other two took hostages upstairs, while some of those attending the rock concert managed to find hiding places. The gunmen died in a shoot-out with police. The Bataclan was the scene of a massacre in which 90 people died. On 18 November police assaulted a flat in the Saint-Denis district of Paris, killing the alleged ringleader of the jihadists, Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Two accomplices died with him. The sole surviving suspect from the attacks, Salah Abdeslam,is due to go on trial in Pariswith 19 other alleged jihadists early next year. Read more on the attacks: What happened at the Bataclan?

Paris attacks: Bataclan reopens, but wounds are not closed In the years after the 2015 horror Christophe Naudin, a history teacher and Bataclan survivor,kept a diary to record his feelings,externaland try to recover from the trauma. He lost a friend called Vincent that night. Christophe cowered in a store room, packed in with other terrified fans, until the police managed to reach the scene and shoot the jihadists. He recalled seeing parts of victims' brains and treading over bodies heaped in the Bataclan audience pit, the newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported. He wrote that he could not forgive the perpetrators, and he felt ""only contempt, not hatred, for the terrorists"". He insists that, besides any social, psychological or political motivations for such outrages, there is ""a religious motivation, a vision of the world and the hereafter which is fundamental to jihadist ideology"".

"This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy Former President Barack Obama has said senior US Republicans are undermining democracy by going along with President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. In an interview with CBS News, due to air on Sunday, Mr Obama said President-elect Joe Biden had ""clearly won"" this year's race for the White House. The result was projected by US media on Saturday but some counting continues. Claiming ballot tampering, Mr Trump has launched a flurry of legal challenges. The president's team has yet to provide any evidence to support their claims. Do these Republican voters accept election result? More Republicans back giving Biden briefings Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount Mr Obama - Mr Trump's Democratic predecessor - said the allegations were motivated by the fact that ""the president doesn't like to lose"". ""I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials, who clearly know better, are going along with this,"" he added. ""It's one more step in delegitimising not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally, and that's a dangerous path."" Mr Obama was speaking ahead of the release of his new memoir, A Promised Land, which charts his rise to the US Senate and first term as president. Due for release on 17 November, it is the first of two books covering his time in the White House. Lindsey Graham is among those backing giving Joe Biden briefings, but remains a Trump ally In his memoir Mr Obama said President Trump ascended to power by stoking fears about a Black man leading the country, according to excerpts quoted by CNN. ""It was as if my very presence in the White House had triggered a deep-seated panic, a sense that the natural order had been disrupted,"" he reportedly wrote. ""For millions of Americans spooked by a Black man in the White House, [Trump] promised an elixir for their racial anxiety."" On Thursday, the two top congressional Democrats - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer - called on Republicans to ""accept reality"" with Joe Biden's victory. How will this endless US election end? A small but growing number of Republicans on Capitol Hill have congratulated Mr Biden or backed calls for him to be given daily intelligence briefings - a usual practice for incoming presidents. But most in the party are standing by President Trump in refusing to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory. This video can not be played A transgender state senator and the youngest congressman are among the new faces making US political history The president-elect is 5.2 million votes ahead of Mr Trump - about 3.4% - and is projected to have enough electoral votes needed in the state-by-state Electoral College to take the presidency. There are reports Mr Trump has told friends he wants to start a digital media company to undermine the conservative network Fox News, whose once full-throated support he now feels lacking. Meanwhile, a group of senior US officials responsible for the integrity of the election has called last week's race ""the most secure in American history,"" sayingthey had found no indication it was compromised,external. ""We can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too,"" the group said in a statement. He has picked veteran political operative Ron Klain to be White House chief of staff. Mr Klain has served as a top aide to Mr Biden since the 1980s in the Senate and later when he was vice-president. The White House chief of staff manages the president's daily schedule and is often described as his gatekeeper. Mr Biden has also continued to call world leaders and other important figures as he presses ahead with preparations to assume the presidency. On Thursday he spoke with Pope Francis, who offered Mr Biden his ""blessings and congratulations"". Mr Biden will be only the second Roman Catholic president of the US.

"Niall McGinn and Tomas Hubocan in action during the first half at Windsor Park Northern Ireland's hopes of reaching Euro 2020 were ended as Slovakia scored deep into extra time to win their play-off final at Windsor Park. The home side had equalised in dramatic style when defender Milan Skriniar put the ball into his own net with two minutes of normal time left to cancel out Juraj Kucka's early opener. Substitute Kyle Lafferty then nearly won it for Northern Ireland when his long-range effort hit the post in the 90th minute. But the game went to extra time and Michal Duris, on from the bench, made the most of a lucky ricochet to score Slovakia's winner in the 110th minute. The win takes Slovakia though to their second consecutive Euro finals and prevents Northern Ireland from repeating their feat from four years ago. Baraclough 'can't ask any more' of NI after Slovakia defeat NI suffer Euro play-off heartache - reaction & as it happened Northern Ireland, backed by a 1,060 crowd that generated a good atmosphere despite being so low in numbers, had been aiming to do just that and reach what would have been a fifth major international tournament appearance. However, while they raised themselves for spells during the game - and perhaps looked more likely to grab a winner during extra time - it was generally a disjointed performance from Ian Baraclough's men. After the joy of Euro 2016 in France, Northern Ireland had given themselves the opportunity to qualify again by beating Bosnia & Herzegovina on penalties in the play-off semi-final in October. A night that ended in despair would have been so different had Lafferty's excellent shot from distance just seconds before the end of 90 minutes gone in rather than striking the outside of the Slovakian post. The hosts went close again in the closing stages of extra time but Jonny Evans' header was saved. Northern Ireland started the game in positive fashion and looked lively for the opening 15 minutes, with the triangle of Stuart Dallas, Paddy McNair and Niall McGinn down the right looking threatening. However, a sloppy mistake by George Saville in the 17th minute led to Slovakia's opening goal as the midfielder misplaced a header back to Evans which allowed Kucka to run through. He was unopposed but still needed to show a lot of composure and good technique to side-foot a clever low finish past Bailey Peacock-Farrell and inside the post. Despite a strong start to the second half, it looked like Northern Ireland's bid for qualification was fading until McNair did well down the right on 87 minutes and produced a low cross that was turned into his own net by Skriniar. After Lafferty was denied by the woodwork, the match was heading towards penalties before a long ball bounced off Evans and into the path of Duris. The substitute struck his shot well but Peacock-Farrell, a hero in the play-off semi-final win, allowed the ball to squeeze in at his near post when he looked well positioned to keep it out. NI striker Josh Magennis challenges Slovakia goalkeeper Marek Rodak Northern Ireland's success in recent years has been built on a core of experienced players who have delivered on a regular basis, particularly in crucial matches. While the squad has lost a few stalwarts to retirement, captain Steven Davis, Premier League table-topping Leicester City defender Evans and the versatile Dallas of Leeds are still vitally important to the team's prospects. Evans was an injury doubt before the squad was named and looked like he may have been labouring as the match went on, although he was hugely unfortunate in the incident that saw the ball bounce off him and into the path of Duris for the winning goal. Davis has been the heartbeat of the team for a long time but, playing in the deep-lying midfield role he has become accustomed to, was unable to impose himself on the match as Slovakia captain Marek Hamsik and Stanislav Lobotka in particular looked assured in possession. Dallas looked to have taken a heavy blow to his arm in the first half and, while the ever-committed former Crusaders man battled on for the whole match, his attacking threat was limited from full-back. There were few surprises in Baraclough's starting team and shape, the only one being Josh Magennis playing on the left of the front three and Conor Washington through the centre, with the latter firing straight at the goalkeeper during Northern Ireland's early second-half rally. They looked too happy to sit off the Slovakians during the first half and let them dominate possession and, while they had a renewed energy after the break, they were unable to sustain that until the late equaliser and Lafferty's fine strike. Despite the euphoria of the shootout win in Bosnia, Northern Ireland have now failed to win during 90 minutes of any of Baraclough's first six games in charge, and have fallen behind in each one of them. Perhaps viewed as more of a safe replacement for Michael O'Neill than an exciting one, his remit from the Irish FA would very much have been to navigate the play-offs and secure another Euros qualification - and the financial rewards for Northern Ireland football that come with it. The boldness he showed with his substitutions in Sarajevo was impressive, but the former Motherwell and Sligo Rovers boss has a major job on his hands in working out where the squad goes from here. It is always easy for an 'end of an era' feel to engulf an international side after such a disappointment, and he will no doubt face tough questions, but in the short term has to prepare his squad for Nations League matches away to Austria and at home to Romania. Victories in either of those will obviously not make up for missing out on the Euros this time, but he needs the momentum of his reign to change - and quickly - before the qualifiers for the World Cup come around.

"Advisers are meant to be seen, not heard. There has, however, rarely been a political aide more visible than Dominic Cummings. He first became particularly known to some for his role as the chief of the campaign to leave the EU, then again as Boris Johnson's provocative senior adviser. But then he found notoriety - and became known to a much wider public who wouldn't always know Westminster figures when, during lockdown, it emerged that the close aide of a prime minister who told people to ""Stay at home, save lives, protect the NHS"" had made a journey of hundreds of miles from London to Barnard Castle. Now after boiling tensions in No 10, Mr Cummings is on his way out. He wrote last year he hoped to make himself ""redundant"" by the end of 2020 and told me late last night that is what he will do. There's no question the announcement of his departure by the end of the year was accelerated by turmoil in No 10 in recent days -  a swirl of split loyalties and factions. Top Johnson aide quits amid infighting at No 10 Cummings to leave No 10 role by Christmas A No 10 insider told me Mr Cummings ""jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon"", suggesting that, in the last few days, the prime minister saw that the former Vote Leave team was just ""in it for themselves"". Indeed, for many Conservatives, Mr Cummings' departure, alongside that of Lee Cain, the former director of communications, brings a chance for a reset. One member of the Cabinet even told me Mr Cummings' exit was a ""blessing"". And yet Dominic Cummings was valued hugely by Boris Johnson - one of the relentless architects of the prime minister's path to a hefty majority. One adviser told me it was a ""huge error to let him go"" - it would allow the Tories to ""regress to being a party of rich southerners and MPs nodding along"". It was perhaps inevitable that the Vote Leave tribe would fight so hard they hurt themselves in the process. Loved by some, loathed by others, the departure of the Vote Leave duo represents a big change at the highest level of government - Boris Johnson losing two of his aides who became controversial but who were also key to creating the political version of him.
