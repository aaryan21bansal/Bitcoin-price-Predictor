"This video can not be played The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected Turkey's calls for a truce to prevent a ""bloodbath"" in north Syria. At a trilateral meeting with Iran and Turkey, Mr Putin said Russia would continue its fight against ""terrorists"" in Idlib province. Idlib is the Syrian opposition's last major stronghold, with almost three million residents. Syrian military forces, backed by Russia and Iran, are poised to launch a major offensive there soon. The three-way meeting in Tehran had been seen by many as a final chance to prevent a large-scale battle in Idlib. Syria has been in a civil war since 2011, after a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into a conflict that has killed more than 350,000 people. Iran, Russia and Turkey have played central roles in the Syrian conflict. Who's in control of Idlib? Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters Why is there a war in Syria? Turkey - which has long backed some rebel groups - fears an all-out assault will trigger another major refugee crisis on its southern border. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian and Iranian counterparts: ""We don't want Idlib to turn into a bloodbath."" ""Any attack on Idlib would result in a catastrophe. Any fight against terrorists requires methods based on time and patience."" Improvised gas masks are being tried out in Idlib ahead of the expected offensive However, Russia and Iran are allied to Syria's President Assad, and say jihadist groups in Idlib must be wiped out. Russian air strikes, and thousands of fighters backed by Iran, have helped the Syrian military attack rebel areas. At Friday's meeting, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani argued that ""fighting terrorism in Idlib is an unavoidable part of the mission of restoring peace and stability to Syria"". Meanwhile Mr Putin said ""the legitimate Syrian government has a right and must eventually take control of its entire national territory"". What will Trump do next on Syria? The province is the last major stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow Mr Assad for the past seven years. The population of Idlib has been swollen by refugees from other parts of Syria It straddles major highways across Syria - and if it is retaken by the government, would leave the rebels with just a few isolated pockets of territory across the country. The province is not controlled by a single group, but rather by a number of rival factions, including a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda, and a rival National Liberation Front which is backed by Turkey. Up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters are believed to be in Idlib. But the vast majority of Idlib's residents are civilians. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. The UN fears a large-scale offensive in Idlib will lead to a humanitarian disaster. Without a political solution in Syria, ""we will see this war reach new levels of horrors"", the UN special envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said. Meanwhile, the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, said the anticipated conflict would be a ""reckless escalation"", and that ""there is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" Protesters in Idlib demonstrated against the Syrian government and Russia on Friday He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. Mr Jeffrey said a ""major diplomatic initiative"" was now needed, and there was ""a new commitment"" by President Donald Trump to remain involved in Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) was defeated and Iranian fighters left the country. How Idlib may be changing Trump's Syria strategy Mr Jeffrey said President Assad had ""no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not Washington's job to oust him. He said the US would work with Russia on a political transition. The Syrian government has denied ever using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any new chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies.

"People being harassed by cold calls about PPI compensation or personal injury claims could gain some respite under new rules being introduced by the government. The new measures mean companies will only be allowed to contact people who have opted-in to receive the calls. Claims management companies that break the rules can be fined up to Â£500,000. Minister for Digital Margot James said: ""Today we are one step closer to ending the menace of nuisance calls."" ""This is probably the single biggest move we've made against these companies,"" she added. ""Our new laws mean people will now have to give consent to receive calls and have the power to choose where they seek compensation for personal injury claims or mis-sold payment protection insurance."" Previously consumers had to ""opt-out"" of receiving the calls by registering with the free Telephone Preference Service or by withdrawing their consent while actually on the call. However, the new powers will force the company making the phone call to check to make sure they have the recipient's consent before calling. Anyone receiving an unwelcome and unexpected call from a claims company should take note of the number and inform the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which has the power to fine firms that breach the rules. Despite a series of measures designed to crackdown on nuisance calls, they keep on coming. The Financial Conduct Authority said that in the past 12 months, about 2.7 billion unsolicited calls, texts and emails were made offering to help people make a claim. That works out at 50 calls, texts or emails being made to every member of the adult population in the past year. James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of operations at the ICO, said the move was a ""step in the right direction"" and would make it easier to carry out ""enforcement action"". He said his office received ""many thousands"" of complaints each year. Last year, it issued 26 fines to some of the worst-offending organisations, generating more than Â£3m, he said. Asked why so few fines were issued, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the ICO was also advising, guiding and serving enforcement notices to companies behind the scenes. The new measures will apply to phone calls only - not texts or emails. Ms James told the BBC: ""The people who bear the brunt of these calls are older people and vulnerable groups. ""While the calls may be a source of annoyance to many people, for older people they can be a deep source of worry and anxiety."" She said the government has given money to Trading Standards to help them install call-blocking devices in the phones of older people. ""But I would urge any family members or older people themselves if they are online to report any breaches to the Information Commissioner's Office."" she said. Victims of annoying cold calls from claims managers can report a breach of the new laws atthe ICO's website,external. Ask cold callers to remove your information from their records Find out caller's number from a landline by dialling 1471 after the call Check with your phone company if you can be made ex-directory Give away personal or financial information, even if callers claim to be from a company you know Lose your temper. Be firm and hang up if the caller refuses to go away Call back phone numbers left on your voicemail, or reply to text messages you don't recognise Source:BBC Skillswise Nuisance call bosses face crackdown Firm 'made 200 million' nuisance calls Firm fined for 75m 'nuisance' calls New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Billy Crystal and Paris Hilton among celebrities to lose homes in wildfires Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"A judge said Yonatan Eyob ""profited from the deaths"" of people in the Grenfell Tower fire A drug dealer has been jailed for more than six years after falsely claiming almost Â£87,000 in funds meant for Grenfell Tower fire survivors. Yonatan Eyob said he was living in the tower block when a blaze ripped through it in June 2017 leaving 72 people dead. At Isleworth Crown Court earlier, Eyob, 26, was jailed for six years and eight months for fraud and drugs offences. Judge Giles Curtis-Raleigh said he had ""profited from the deaths"" of people who died in the fire. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Eyob's fraudulent claims were ""the largest known convicted Grenfell fraud so far"". Eyob, from Notting Hill, claimed he had been lodging with a friend in Flat 182, which was home to a family of five who died in the blaze. The judge described the fire as ""a disaster which shocked the nation"", and said Eyob had been treated as a ""bereaved survivor and given top priority"". The tower block fire in June 2017 killed 72 people Eyob was put up in the Holland Park Hilton between July 2017 and June 2018 and given a food allowance and pre-paid cards. He received Â£15,918.20 on pre-paid cards, Â£60,945 in hotel accommodation and Â£9,968.36 for laundry and parking - a total of just over Â£86,831. The judge said Eyob had decided to ""enrich"" himself by ""plundering the funds that were put aside for the victims"". After suspicions were aroused, footage of the tower was viewed and showed the family he claimed to live with but Eyob could not be seen. Drugs, including MDMA and cocaine, and seven mobile phones were also found in his hotel room, along with about Â£3,000 in cash, designer clothes, jewellery and credit cards. Hannan Wahabi, the sister of Abdulaziz El-Wahabi who lived in the flat, said what Eyob did was ""a stain on all those who died in the terrible incident"". Parents Faouzia and Abdulaziz, 42 and 52, died alongside their children, Yasin, 20, Huda, 16, and Mehdi, eight, on the 21st floor of the tower .

"Laura Beattie, who has cystic fibrosis, is waiting for a lung transplant The number of people waiting for a lung transplant has gone up by 46% over the past five years, according to official figures. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said the challenge of matching lungs of the right size and a rising number of ageing donors are possible factors. It called on people to talk about organ donation, because lung transplants are the only hope for those on the list. The overall waiting list for organs has come down over the same period. There are now 354 people waiting for a new lung in the UK, compared to 242 in 2012-13 - Laura Beattie from Greater Manchester is one of them. Laura, 29, from Stretford, has cystic fibrosis and was added to the transplant waiting list just over a month ago. Her lung function has declined over the last couple of years, and is now at around 24%. ""I've known for more than 20 years that I would need a transplant one day but I was still terrified to be told I was going on the list because it made it real,"" said Laura. ""But I know it's the right thing to do. I get breathless even turning over in bed or getting dressed."" Laura now uses oxygen every day and also a wheelchair when she goes out for more than a few hours. She also requires non-invasive ventilation overnight. Laura co-founded a business with her sister Rachel Despite this, she has co-founded a fashion business with her sister. She said: ""I could be waiting a short time or a long time, I don't know. I just try and get on with my life. ""I really hope more people support and really consider donation because a transplant is my only option now and donation can save so many lives."" Lungs and hearts are both delicate organs, which makes successful donation and transplantation more problematic, particularly when donors are mostly aged over 50 and are more likely to have existing health problems. The waiting list for hearts is the only organ-specific waiting list that has also risen. In contrast, there are currently 6,013 people on the overall waiting list for an organ - a 17% decline over the same period, from 7,335. NHSBT said the causes of the rise in the lung transplant waiting list were being investigated and an increased number of referrals for a transplant was a potential factor. But family refusal remained the biggest barrier to all types of organ donation and transplantation, it said. John Forsythe, associate medical director for organ donation and transplantation at NHSBT, said 65 people died on the lung transplant waiting list last year. ""Many of those lives could have been saved or transformed had more families said yes to donation,"" he said. ""Sadly, many donation opportunities are lost every year because families don't know if their loved one wanted to be a donor or not. We urgently need people to tell their families they want to donate."" A new opt-out system for organ donation is planned in England by 2020, where adults will be presumed to be organ donors unless they specifically record their decision not to be. A similar system is in place in Wales. Scotland plans to introduce an opt-out system, and Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest.

"Musk was offered a joint by a podcast host during filming in California, where marijuana is legal Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has smoked marijuana live on the web duringa podcast with comedian Joe Rogan,external. Mr Rogan offered his guest the drug, which is legal in California, as the pair discussed tech innovation and the public's perception of Mr Musk. ""I mean, it's legal, right?"" asked the Tesla founder, before taking a drag on the joint. Tesla shares fell more than nine per cent following Mr Musk's appearance on the show. BBC business correspondent Kim Gittleson says the podcast appearance coupled with the departure of a key executive who blamed increasing public scrutiny of the company for his decision to leave has shaken investor confidence in Tesla. Last month, Mr Musk said he was not ""on weed"" when he tweeted about plans to make the electric car company a private firm. The business leader made the comments in an interview with the New York Times. He also told the newspaperhe works ""120-hour weeks"" and takes sedatives. His controversial plans regarding Tesla's ownership were dropped about two weeks later, followingoutrage from some investors. Tesla saw its share price fall after Mr Musk's tweet Elon Musk has certainly had a wild summer. From his frequent tweet storms, to accusing a British rescue diver in Thailand of pedophilia, to a quick u-turn on an effort to take Tesla private - it's no wonder both investors and his closest friends have begun to worry. This latest incident certainly won't allay those concerns. But when it comes to Tesla, the erratic behaviour of Mr Musk might be the least of the company's problems. That's because the electric car maker has consistently struggled to hit its production targets, even as it's taken on more debt. Tesla has long been one of the most bet-against stocks on Wall Street. While that's something that has long frustrated Mr Musk, this certainly won't change that. Tesla's chief accounting officer Dave Morton said he had resigned after only one month in the role, citing ""the level of public attention placed on the company"" among his reasons. The firm's head of HR, Gaby Toledano, also announced she would not rejoin the company after a leave of absence. During the podcast, Mr Rogan offered Mr Musk a joint, which he said contained a mix of tobacco and marijuana - dried leaves and flowering parts of the female cannabis plant. Of 50 US states, recreational cannabis remains illegal in 41 - but it was legalised in California, where the podcast was filmed, in January. ""Is that a cigar?"" asked Mr Musk when his host first proffered the joint. He later added that he ""almost never"" smoked marijuana, noting, ""I don't find that it is very good for productivity"". The pair also enjoyed whiskey during the podcast recording. Mr Musk pointed out: ""Alcohol's a drug."" During their conversation, Mr Musk talked about his health and his management of Tesla - which he said was the most challenging of his various businesses and projects. To close the podcast, Mr Musk was asked if he had any concluding remarks. ""I think people should be nicer to each other,"" he said. ""And giveâ¦ give more credit to others and don't assume they're mean until you know they're actually mean. ""It's easy to demonise people, you're usually wrong about it, people are nicer than you think.""

"The school has been shut for the second time since it opened last month A new Â£28m school campus in Dumfries has been closed on safety grounds after a second incident within two weeks. The EIS teaching union said an interactive whiteboard had fallen on a pupil in a class. Contractors Graham said it had immediately investigated and concluded ""excessive force"" had been used on the sliding smart screen. The same campus was closed last month after apupil was struck by a sliding doorwhich came off its rails. Dumfries and Galloway Council said it had ""lost confidence"" in assurances it had been given over the North West Community Campus in Dumfries. The facility opened to pupils in August despite concerns a few weeks earlier, when it was claimed a ceiling had collapsed. A subsequent investigation blamed the issue on an error fitting a sprinkler system which had caused ""sagging and superficial damage"". The school opened in time for the start of the new term, but was then closed for two days after the incident involving the sliding door. The council said it was ""appalled"" by the latest incident, but declined to comment on reports that another child had been hurt. It is understood the boy was not seriously injured. The council has said the school would not reopen until it was certified safe The council said it would not reopen the school until it was ""absolutely confident"" and had independent assurances that ""every bolt, screw and fitting"" had been certified safe. ""An incident response team has been set up to assure the continuity of pupil education,"" it added. ""The young people of north west Dumfries deserve much more and we are angry and disappointed at the disruption to their education."" The EIS and Unison unions both welcomed the decision to shut the site. ""There have been a series of incidents at the NWCC, which have left staff deeply concerned about safety,"" they said in a statement. ""We understand that Health and Safety Executive officials will visit the NWCC next week and our health and safety representatives look forward to engaging with them."" The contract company Graham said it had investigated the ""unfortunate incident"" and had examined the screen and its mounting brackets along with experts from the installation company. ""It's clear from this examination that the screen was subject to a very high level of excessive force, which caused it to separate from the bracket,"" a spokesman said. ""We have also examined the remaining 20 screens in the school and all are functioning normally, and in line with the strict tolerances and operational guidelines.""

"Actor Chris Pine has expressed surprise at the interest generated by a scene of full-frontal male nudity in his new film about Robert the Bruce. One publication has even suggestedthe Star Trek actor's penis is the ""breakout star"",externalof this year's Toronto Film Festival. ""We all have certain body parts, so it's a trip when showing what we all have becomes a Google Alert,"" said Pine of festival opener Outlaw King. ""The guy's having a bath, and people don't tend to do that with their clothes on,"" added the film's director, David Mackenzie. Set in the 14th Century, Outlaw King tells how Robert the Bruce led Scotland's fight for independence from England following William Wallace's death. Outlaw King to open international festival Outlaw King boosts Scottish film sector Moore premieres Trump 'warning' film The film is being distributed worldwide by subscription giant Netflix but will be shown in some Scottish cinemas. Pine, who previously worked with Mackenzie on 2016's Hell or High Water, pointed out their gritty medieval epic contained copious instances of ""debowelling [sic] and beheading"". ""Somehow, though, that is not nearly as interesting or revelatory or exclamatory to a modern audience,"" the 38-year-old told reporters on Friday. Chris Pine (L) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (R) with director David Mackenzie at the world premier of Outlaw King at the Toronto Pine admitted shooting Outlaw King in the UK last year had posed many challenges, from riding a horse and wielding a sword to mastering a Scottish brogue. ""The reason I jumped in was because of David,"" he continued. ""I've made a lot of big films, but never one with a director of his artistry and sensitivity."" Mackenzie said he had aimed for a ""method epic realism"" in the film combining ""poetry and intimacy"" with realistic war scenes. It is one of the most ambitious projects to date for a film-maker who has been widely tipped to direct the next James Bond film following Danny Boyle's departure. The director declined to address speculation linking him to the film, currently known as Bond 25. ""I finished this film two days ago and it's been a very hard journey,"" he told the BBC. ""I haven't given a second thought to what I'm doing next, apart from maybe taking a break."" As one of this generation's leading men, meanwhile, Pine was happy to pay tribute to the late Burt Reynolds following his death on Thursday at the age of 82. ""He left a lot of great work and should be applauded for that,"" he said, singling out - perhaps with his own recent exposure in mind - Reynolds' famous nude photo shoot for Cosmopolitan magazine.

"This video can not be played A huge plastic-collection system will be towed out into the Pacific Ocean When a Dutch teenager went swimming in the sea in Greece seven years ago, he was shocked to see more plastic than fish. In fact, Boyan Slat was so appalled by the pollution that he soon started to campaign for the oceans to be cleaned up. For a long time, few people took him seriously. Here was a university drop-out with a far-fetched idea that surely could never work. But this weekend, backed by major investment and some massive engineering, a vast plastic collection system will be towed out of San Francisco Bay. Until now, the focus of plastic litter campaigns has been on beaches, with volunteers all over the world lifting bags and bottles from shorelines. UN commits to stop ocean plastic waste The woman who found a new threat in plastic Ocean plastic could triple in decade Even those who question the approach applaud Boyan Slat's passion Never before has anyone gone further by trying to clear the stuff from the middle of an ocean and, despite sea trials and computer modelling, no-one knows if the experiment will work. Some experts worry that the effort is a distraction from the more pressing task of stopping more plastic getting into the sea in the first place, and that the operation may cause real harm to marine life. But Boyan and his team at The Ocean Cleanup non-profit  believe the sheer scale of plastic out there demands that action be taken. Their target is the eastern Pacific and what's called the Great Garbage Patch, where circular currents have concentrated plastic in one large area. The aim is to halve the amount of pollution in the patch every five years so that by 2040 almost all of it will be gone. ""We feel we're in a great hurry,"" says Lonneke Holierhoek, the project's chief operating officer. I'm meeting her at the project's headquarters in Rotterdam in offices that are far bigger than I expected. The Dutch government is a major backer, along with some wealthy companies and investors. The technology has been developed with support from the Dutch government The project, with a budget of at least â¬20m (Â£18m), has grown from a young man's vision to a serious international enterprise. There's a faint smell of seaweed and rubbish. On the desks and the floor are boxes brimming with fragments of plastic hauled from the sea on earlier expeditions, a reminder of the task ahead. ""If we don't do it,"" Lonneke tells me, ""all this plastic will start breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces - and the smaller the pieces are, the more harmful and the harder to extract from the marine environment."" As an engineer who spent the past two decades working on offshore projects, she's not a campaigner but someone with a wealth of experience working with huge structures out at sea. For her, the project is a determined effort to reverse the tide of pollution. ""Rather than talking about it or contributing to problems or protesting against it, it's actually trying to solve it."" The key point is that the collection system is passive - there are no motors, no machines. Instead, it'll drift, acting like an artificial coastline, gently gathering any plastic in its path. Like a giant snake, made up of sections of tube, it's 600m (2,000ft) long and will float in a giant 'U' shape. Beneath it a screen will hang down 3m (10ft). Because the plastic is floating just at or slightly below the surface, it only drifts with the force of the ocean currents. But because the collection system is also being shifted by the wind and waves, it should travel about one knot faster, shepherding the plastic into a dense mass. The team says the screen is designed to minimise collateral impacts on marine life Fish should be able to swim underneath and, since the device has smooth surfaces, the hope is that no wildlife will become entangled. On-board cameras will keep watch, and every six weeks or so a ship will travel out to scoop up the concentrated tangle of plastic and take it back to dry land to be recycled. The plan is to use the recovered material to make a range of products to be deliberately marketed as ""made from ocean plastic"" and sold at a premium price. Some experts I've spoken to are worried that marine life might suffer. Anything drifting in the sea soon gets coated in algae, attracting plankton which draw in small fish and then bigger ones. Industrial fishing fleets actually deploy ""fish aggregation devices"" to act as lures. Lonneke Holierhoek has an answer. An independent environmental study found that the impact can be minimised, she says, for example by making a noise just before the plastic is lifted out to scare away fish. But Sue Kinsey of the Marine Conservation Society is among those who aren't convinced. She admires the passion and inspiration behind the project but says it could be harmful. ""The major problem is those creatures that passively float in the ocean that can't actually move out of the way - once they're in this array, they're going to be trapped there unable to move,"" she says. She also says it's more cost-effective to clean up beaches instead and focus on preventing more plastic reaching the oceans. Guide: Why is plastic a problem? Seven charts that explain plastic pollution Prof Richard Lampitt of the UK's National Oceanography Centre also applauds the project for raising awareness but reckons much of the plastic that gets into the sea sinks relatively quickly so that the effort won't be able to make much of a difference. And he also highlights the carbon cost of building 60 of the collection devices, as the plan calls for, and the shuttling of the ships back and forth, all to retrieve an estimated 8,000 tonnes of plastic a year. ""The cost/benefit ratio does not look at all attractive,"" Prof Lampitt tells me. Back in Rotterdam, one of the project's scientists, Laurent Lebreton, is convinced the effort is worth it, and he shows me two examples of plastic waste impacting the natural world. A small piece of white coral has grown around the fibres of an old fishing net - a surprisingly shocking sight. And on the jagged edge of a plastic bottle there are unmistakeable tooth marks left by a fish that's taken a bite. ""That plastic gets swallowed and the fish gets eaten and the plastic enters the food chain and ends up on our plates,"" Laurent says. ""The solution is - one - making sure plastic doesn't get into the natural environment, and - two - clean up the legacy plastic that's been accumulating since the 1950s."" It'll take three weeks for the system to be towed out to the Great Garbage Patch some 2,000km (1,200 miles) off the coast of California. The first sense of how it's performing should be clear later this year.

"This video can not be played Miller (pictured) was due to go on tour next month. His friend, rapper Pittsburgh Slim, was among those paying tribute US rapper Mac Miller has been found dead at his California home, a Los Angeles coroner has confirmed. Media reports say the 26-year-old, who was open about his substance abuse, died from an apparent overdose. The rapper, whose real name was Malcolm James McCormick, rose to fame after topping US charts with his debut album in 2011. He released his latest record, Swimming, earlier this year and was due to go on tour. ""The music artist known as Mac Miller died today in his Studio City home,"" the LA County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner said in a statement. ""In the late morning of September 7, Malcolm McCormick was found unresponsive.... authorities were called and Miller was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:51 (18:51 GMT). ""At this time, an autopsy is pending and a cause of death has not been determined."" Miller went through a well-publicised break-up with singer and girlfriend Ariana Grande earlier this year. The pair, who met in 2012, collaborated on a number of songs and performed together at the One Love Manchester concert in 2017. Charges were filed against the rapper last month after he was arrested in May for driving under the influence and hit and run. Grande spoke out publicly about ending their ""toxic relationship""after fans blamed her for his arrest. Grande suspended comments on her Instagram account on Friday shortly after Miller's death ""I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be,"" she said in a typed message posted on social media. Grande said she had ""tried to support his sobriety"" for years, and was praying that he ""figures it all out"". Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Miller began to focus on his music while still at school and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac at just 15. Maturing in the public eye, he starred in a MTV reality series in 2013 which followed him and a group of friends after he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his career. He released a series of albums and EPs across the last decade, collaborating with high-profile artists like Kendrick Lamar and Pharrell Williams. In his final tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper promoted the North American tour he was set to embark on next month. He was ""a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans."" his family said, in a statement confirming his death. Artists including Snoop Dog, Wiz Khalifa and Shawn Mendes paid tribute to Miller after news of his death broke on Friday. In a moving tweet, Chance the Rapper said he was ""completely broken"" after hearing the news and described Miller as ""one of the sweetest guys I ever knew"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by BBC Music Reporter Mark Savage A lot of rappers don't make beats. A lot of beat-makers can't rap. Mac Miller could do it all, lending an uncommon intimacy to his best songs. He started piano lessons at the age of six, later picking up drums, bass and keyboards. By the age of 15, he'd released his first mixtape, But My Mackin' Ain't Easy, but it was his fourth release, 2010's KIDS - a playful, freewheeling collection of party tunes that won him a recording contract. Over the years, he shed his frivolous, frat-boy reputation, making increasingly mature, introspective records that dealt with his personal demons; as well as 2016's The Divine Feminine, a naive but affecting (and occasionally too-graphic) concept album about what he called ""the feminine energy of the planet,""  but which many took to be a tribute to his partner, Ariana Grande. The rapper had more than eight million followers on Twitter In music, and in his interviews, he was open about his addictions - which eventually prompted Grande to end their relationship, describing it as a ""toxic relationship"". But Miller refused to exploit their break-up on his latest album, Swimming. ""Everybody wants a headline / I don't got nothin' to say,"" he rapped on Programs, released in May, just weeks after their split was confirmed. Instead, the album documented his ongoing struggles with substance abuse. ""Got my head underwater, but I ain't in the shower, and I ain't getting baptised,"" he confessed on Jet Fuel. The halting vocals and fractured, subdued production made it clear he was suffering but there was always a sense of optimism - a promise that those demons could be beaten. Tragically, it appears he lost the battle. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"British Airways's boss has apologised for what he says was a sophisticated breach of the firm's security systems, and has promised compensation. Alex Cruz told the BBC that hackers carried out a ""sophisticated, malicious criminal attack"" on its website. The airline said personal and financial details of customers making or changing bookings had been compromised. About 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details. ""We are 100% committed to compensate them, period,"" Mr Cruz told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are committed to working with any customer who may have been financially affected by this attack, and we will compensate them for any financial hardship that they may have suffered."" BA said the breach took place between 22:58 BST on 21 August and 21:45 BST on 5 September.  Shares in BA parent group IAG closed 1.4% lower on Friday. Mr Cruz also told the Today programme: ""We're extremely sorry. I know that it is causing concern to some of our customers, particularly those customers that made transactions over BA.com and app. ""We discovered that something had happened but we didn't know what it was [on Wednesday evening]. So overnight, teams were trying to figure out the extent of the attack. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated ""The first thing was to find out if it was something serious and who it affected or not. The moment that actual customer data had been compromised, that's when we began immediate communication to our customers."" BA said all customers affected by the breach had been contacted on Thursday night.  The breach only affects people who bought tickets during the timeframe provided by BA, and not on other occasions. Mr Cruz added: ""At the moment, our number one purpose is contacting those customers that made those transactions to make sure they contact their credit card bank providers so they can follow their instructions on how to manage that breach of data."" The airline has taken out adverts apologising for the breach in Friday's newspapers. By Simon Read, business reporter What data was stolen? ""It was name, email address, credit card information - that would be credit card number, expiration date and the three digit [CVV] code on the back of the credit card,"" said BA boss Mr Cruz. BA insists it did not store the CVV numbers.  This is prohibited under international standards set out by the PCI Security Standards Council. Since BA said the attackers also managed to obtain CVV numbers, security researchers have speculated that the card details were intercepted, rather than harvested from a BA database. How did hackers get in? It isn't totally clear how hackers boarded BA's website and app - but cyber-security experts have some suggestions. How did hackers get into British Airways? What could the hackers do with the data? Once fraudsters have your personal information, they may be able to access your bank account, or open new accounts in your name, or use your details to make fraudulent purchases. They could also sell on your details to other crooks. What do I need to do? If you've been affected, you should change your online passwords. Then monitor your bank and credit card accounts keeping an eye out for any dodgy transactions. Also be very wary of any emails or calls asking for more information to help deal with the data breach: crooks often pose as police, banks or, in this instance they could pretend to be from BA. Will my booking be affected? BA says none of the bookings have been hit by the breach.  It said it has contacted all those affected to alert them to the problem with their data, but booked flights should go ahead. Will there be compensation for me? If you suffer any financial loss or hardship, the airline has promised to compensate you. Jorg Herrera, from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, received an email from BA last night having booked tickets with the airline last month. ""I have six cards linked to my BA account,"" he told the BBC. ""I have no idea how much of my information has been stolen. ""I will have to go to each of my credit card providers, cancel the cards, and all the direct debits, etc, related to those cards. This will take a long time, something I have to do with no help from BA. ""This whole thing is terribly concerning and really annoying."" BA could potentially face fines from the Information Commissioner's Office, which is looking into the breach. Rachel Aldighieri, managing director of the Direct Marketing Association, said: ""British Airways has a duty to ensure their customer data is always secure. They need to show that they have done everything possible to ensure such a breach won't happen again. ""The risks go far beyond the fines regulators can issue - albeit that these could be hefty under the new [EU data protection] GDPR regime."" Under GDPR, fines can be up to 4% of annual global revenue. BA's total revenue in the year to 31 December 2017 was Â£12.226bn, so that could be a potential maximum of Â£489m. The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre also confirmed they were assessing the incident. This is not the first customer relations problem to affect the airline in recent times. In July, BA apologised afterIT issues caused dozens of flights in and out of Heathrow Airport to be cancelled. The month before,more than 2,000 BA passengers had their tickets cancelledbecause the prices were too cheap. And in May 2017, problems with BA's IT systems led to thousands of passengers having their plans disrupted, afterall flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were cancelled. ""It does not indicate that the information systems are the most robust in the airline industry,"" Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, told the BBC. However, he does not think BA will be affected in the long term by the breach. ""The airline has immense strength. Notably it's holding a majority of slots at Heathrow, and an enviable safety record, so while this is embarrassing and will potentially cost tens of millions of pounds to resolve, it's more like another flesh wound for BA, rather than anything serious.""

He was the first former Trump aide arrested in the probe into an alleged Kremlin plot to sway the 2016 US vote. US President Donald Trump reacted by taking an apparent swipe at the cost of the investigation into the former aide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last November, Mr Sessions testified to Congress that he had ""pushed back"" against Papadopoulos' offer.

The envoy told US investigators, shortly after the emails hacked from the Democratic Party were leaked. When the FBI interviewed Papadopoulos in January 2017, he falsely claimed he had met two individuals with Russian ties before he joined the president's team in March 2016. He had actually met them after joining Mr Trump's campaign. One individual was a Russian woman whom Papadopoulos believed had connections to the Russian government. In July 2018, the US Department of Justice charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials. Prosecutors said Papadopoulos's lack of cooperation with investigators meant they were unable to effectively question or detain Mr Mifsud. The professor has since left the United States. No connection between Mr Misfud and the hacked emails has been proven. The mystery professor behind Trump Russia inquiry The Democratic National Committee, which is suing Russia, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over the alleged  election interference in the 2016, filed a court document on Friday, saying Mr Mifsud ""was missing and may be deceased"", without any further explanation, according to Bloomberg News.

"Kamikaze outsold its nearest competitor - Mama Mia! Here We Go Again - by three copies to one. Eminem's surprise album Kamikaze has made UK chart history. It's the rapper's ninth record in a row to go to number one, breaking the record for most consecutive chart-topping albums - a title previously held by Led Zeppelin and ABBA. Fans and artists tell Radio 1 Newsbeat the milestone confirms Eminem as the ""greatest of all time"". And while plenty agree, some say reaching the landmark means it's ""high-time for him to retire as an act"". Ray BLK thinks that unlike some rappers, Eminem isn't afraid to express himself Speaking to Newsbeat at theGRM Daily Rated Awards, Ray BLK described Eminem's career as ""iconic"". ""He's a rapper who really expresses himself - a lot of other rappers don't do that. Maybe they're afraid to. ""I loved his really comedic phase when he was doing really funny videos as well."" The comedy era of Eminem came early in the rapper's career. Tracks like My Name Is from 1999's The Slim Shady LP and 2002's Without Me were accompanied by videos which often saw him taking on light-hearted storylines. It was the era when Krept & Konan had his music ""on repeat"". Krept and Konan think he's the ""greatest of all time"" ""He is one of the best artists in the world, period. In his creativity, videos - everything. ""Eminem is the GOAT - that's the word that comes to mind straight away when you think about him."" His status hasn't come without controversy though - Eminem's lyrics have always split opinion. We don't have enough time to list the many, many subjects he's rapped questionably about over the years - but the list includes domestic abuse and school shootings. And he's been regularly criticised for the homophobic slurs that have featured in his songs - which evenappearon Kamikaze in a diss directed towards Tyler, The Creator. It's the sort of thing that can't be overlooked, according to leader singer of Imagine Dragons, Dan Reynolds. He tweeted: ""It's never ok to say a word that is filled with hate. I don't care what year you were born in or what meaning it has to you. ""If it contributes to hate and bigotry then it is hateful. period."" Allow Twitter content?

The use of homophobic lyrics is also criticised by Dan Stubbs, Commissioning Editor at NME. Speaking to Annie Mac on Radio 1, he said: ""Twenty years ago when he first came out, no-one would have blinked at this but the world has changed and he should have changed with it. ""I think it's a blot on an album that didn't need it. On an album with lots of things to talk about, this one's taken attention because it's shocking."" For producer Steel Banglez, it's the team working around Eminem that have been the most inspiring. ""Mike Elizondo, who works with Dr. Dre, is a producer who I really idolise,"" he says. ""He's the guy behind Lose Yourself and he made a lot of the Marshall Mathers EP. ""I was in the studio with him at the start of this year - his production style is what's influenced me."" Big Narstie says Eminem is a ""lyrical genius"", but wonders whether other artists could potentially achieve similar success with access to the ""money machine that Eminem's got behind him"". ""If someone could throw 30 or 50 million behind my project... wow. ""I'd love to see what he's done being achieved by an independent label with a budget of like, Â£25,000."" Allow Twitter content?

The album's had a generally positive response from fans, too. It's a contrast from the reaction to 2017's Revival, which was""skewered by reviewers"".,external ""I don't know what he was doing with that Pink jam,"" long-time fan Vikar tells Newsbeat. Vikar clearly wasn't a fan of Need Me, which features the singer. And after being disappointed by Revival generally, he wasn't expecting much from Kamikaze. ""But when I heard it I thought, he must have realised the mistakes he was making before. ""He's changed his choppy flows and maybe not working with Rick Rubin helped. TheDr. Dre touchhas boosted it."" Despite being positively surprised, Vikar thinks it might be time for Em to hang up his mic. Vikar says it would be a good time for the rapper to start working behind the scenes ""Eminem is a brand so however good or bad his albums are, they're always going to go to number one because he has such a fandom. ""When he released Revival I thought he should have stopped, but it wouldn't have been a very good album for him to retire with. ""Now that Kamikaze's out I'm not sure if he can produce a better album. ""He should quit releasing albums now. He could start producing albums for other people - but this seems like the right album for him to retire with."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Nazis, demagogues and conspiracy theories - three Obama attacks on Trump Former US President Barack Obama has launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump and the ""crazy stuff that is coming out of this White House"". ""This is not normal, these are extraordinary times and they are dangerous times,"" Mr Obama told students at the University of Illinois. He called for ""a restoration of honesty and decency and lawfulness in our government"". The ex-president has kept a low profile since he left office in 2017 until now. Top US officials deny 'gutless' editorial US mid-term elections in eight charts Mr Obama told Friday's awards ceremony in Urbana, Illinois, that he had been intending to follow the American tradition of former presidents exiting the political stage. He instead launched into a searing attack on the current Republican administration. In response, President Donald Trump said at a Republican fundraiser in Fargo, North Dakota, on Friday that he had watched his predecessor's speech, ""but I fell asleep"". Mr Obama was trying to take credit for ""the incredible things happening to our country"", he added. US wage growth hits nine-year high Trump says new China tariffs are ready By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington Democrats  - with some frustration - have been waiting for the reappearance of Barack Obama for some while. The party's not-so-secret weapon has been reluctant to break with the tradition which dictates that former presidents don't snipe from the sidelines. There's also been the matter of a book to write and raising money for his foundation. But now it looks like he's prepared to launch himself wholeheartedly into the mid-term campaign for the next eight weeks. While the headlines of this speech will all focus on the criticisms of the current president, there was also a serious message directed at his own party. Build coalitions - across racial, socio-economic and geographical divides. It was the formula that won him two presidential terms, and it was his message to the party as it attempts to wrest back control of Congress. But there's a huge dilemma here, for Barack Obama and for his party. There's no doubt he has the ability to fire up the Democratic foot soldiers like no-one else can. But equally he can be a galvanising motivation for the ultras in the Republican party. One thing we can be sure of: Donald Trump will feel he's just got himself another big target to aim at as he hits the stump, too. In his address, Mr Obama warned that American democracy depended on his audience turning out to vote in the November's congressional mid-term elections. ""Now, some of you may think I am exaggerating when I say this election is more important than any I can remember in my lifetime,"" the Democrat said. ""But just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different."" Mr Obama made an apparent reference to a New York Times editorial that has infuriated Mr Trump. Its anonymous author, described as a senior Trump administration official, claimed to be with working colleagues to protect the country from the current president's ""worst inclinations"". Mr Obama said: ""They are not doing us a service by actively promoting 90% of the crazy stuff that is coming out of this White House and then saying, 'Don't worry. We are preventing the other 10%.'"" But he also told his audience that Mr Trump was ""a symptom, not the cause"" of the divisions in the US. Can we tell now if Democrats will win?? Why US mid-term elections matter He lacerated Mr Trump's calls for the US Department of Justice to investigate his political enemies. ""It should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents."" The 44th president of the US was also scathing about Mr Trump's initial restraint when asked last year to condemn far-right protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""We are supposed to stand up to bullies, not follow them,"" Mr Obama said. ""We are supposed to stand up to discrimination and we sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathisers."" ""How hard can that be? Saying Nazis are bad?""

"The Williams family live and work on the wildlife reserve The wife and son of a British scientist are in a critical condition after being attacked by a giraffe on a wildlife reserve in South Africa. Katy Williams and three-year-old Finn were flown to hospital in Johannesburg on Monday after being trampled by a female giraffe who was with her calf. Sam Williams, who works on the Blyde Wildlife Estate, said the giraffe may have seen his wife and son as a threat. In a statement, he said he would ""take one day at a time and remain positive"". His wife and son are said to be in a stable but critical condition in a private hospital in Johannesburg. Trophy hunter criticised for dead giraffe pose Giant python swallows Indonesian woman Elephants relocated from South Africa to Mozambique Both British-born Mr Williams and his American wife (who is also a British resident) are scientists with post-PhD experience in animal-related fields. The family live and work on the reserve in South Africa's Limpopo province. It is understood Mrs Williams, 35, and Finn were attacked at around 18:00 local time on Monday, about 150m from their home. Mr Williams, who was returning from a run, witnessed the attack and was able to chase the giraffe away before calling the emergency services. Giraffes can behave unpredictably if they feel threatened He called the accident an ""unfortunate act of nature"", speculating that the giraffe - which is not a typically aggressive species - had lashed out in defence of her two-month-old calf. Doctors operated on Finn in the early hours of Tuesday morning, to relieve pressure in his brain due to injuries sustained in the attack. ""Dr Sam Williams would like to thank all doctors and medical personal from the hospital for their efforts to give his wife and son the best chance to heal,"" said the statement issued by Marina Botha, the lawyer representing the family. ""The family said that they have decided to take one day at a time and to remain positive."" Riaan Cilliers, the manager of the Blyde Wildlife Estate, said: ""We are all in shock about this very sad incident and we ensure the family that they are in our prayers.""

"The words ""Class War"" were spray painted on the new Tarmac Residents in a road where a spike-topped wall once divided rich and poor have slammed a decision to lay new Tarmac only at the ""posh"" end of the street. The fresh surface, in Wentworth Road, Oxford, was spray-painted with the words ""class war"" after it appeared. Those in neighbouring Aldrich Road said the work stopped at the point where the Cutteslowe Walls stood. Oxford City Council said the decision was based on need. Rachel, who did not want to give her surname, has lived in Aldrich Road for 30 years. She said: ""The council should have resurfaced the whole road. They've gone right to where the wall was so I can understand why people are angry about it. ""By doing this they've caused a massive issue. I'm angry about it but spraying graffiti over the road is not on."" Built in 1934 at the point where Aldrich Road became Wentworth Road. They were more than two metres high and topped with spikes The two structures divided the Cutteslowe estate from private housing built by developer Clive Saxton, who feared his homes would not sell with ""slum"" dwellers as neighbours Many attempts by protesters and the council to remove them were foiled, until 1953, when local authorities were given powers of compulsory purchase Finally, on 9 March 1959, after the city had purchased the strips of land on which the walls stood, they came down. Another resident, Liz Patterson, said: ""It's possible our road didn't need doing, but given the history you can understand why people might feel like that. ""This is a small community, there are pockets of poverty. ""The resurfacing stops right on the divide so of course people are going to question that. It's absurd. ""When I saw it I thought: 'I'm obviously on the wrong side of the road'. ""While I can see some humour in it, others are upset."" Oxford City Council said: ""Oxford Direct Services resurfaced Wentworth Road earlier this year. ""The decision to resurface this road was purely based on need. ""The structural condition was far worse in Wentworth Road and this led to the decision to resurface this road first.""

"Carl Hartley will serve at least six years in prison for two rapes and a sexual assault A rapist who targeted vulnerable women and sexually assaulted a mother in front of her child has been jailed for life. Carl Hartley, 26, followed a woman out of a pub in Wakefield before knocking her to the ground and raping her. He also raped a 20-year-old woman in an alleyway after she spoke to him about her upset at having had a miscarriage. Hartley had been repeatedly bailed, which drew criticism from the judge,the Yorkshire Post reported,external. Hartley, of Summerfield Green, Leeds, admitted two counts of rape and one of sexual assault at Leeds Crown Court. According to the Yorkshire Post, Judge Christopher Batty said he could not understand why Hartley was not remanded in custody or charged but was instead released on bail on six occasions by the police and magistrates' courts. In response, West Yorkshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Tim Kingsman said that Hartley was ""investigated on multiple occasions by police between 2014 and 2016"". 'It is clearly regrettable that he was on the streets for so long and we wish to express our sympathy to the victims. The court heard the first rape happened on 6 February 2014, when Hartley attacked a woman after she left a pub. He raped his second victim months later, after laying in wait for her outside a nightclub on 17 May. Hartley's third victim had been holding her three-year-old daughter as he sexually assaulted her. He went to the woman's house on 1 July 2017, having offered to do some gardening work, but he attacked her once he got inside. The court heard that all three women had been left with ""significant psychological damage"" as a result of the attacks, with some developing anxiety and depression. Judge Berry described Hartley as ""a sexual predator, a highly dangerous man"" and said he must serve a minimum jail term of six years and 117 days.

"Waterstones is buying the 115 year-old family-owned chain Foyles, saying the deal will help to ""champion"" real bookshops in the face of online rivals. The sale includes Foyles' well-known Charing Cross Road store in central London, which was relocated to larger premises in 2014. Waterstones said the deal would help booksellers fight back against Amazon's ""siren call"". The larger chain has 283 bookshops across the UK and northern Europe. Foyles was founded at the turn of the last century by the Foyle family and for more than half a century was run by the famously eccentric Christina Foyle. Her approach included sorting the books by publisher rather than alphabetically, and regularly dismissing staff after a year. Foyles was founded in London in 1903 by brothers William and Gilbert Foyle Her nephew, Christopher Foyle, who took over the company from her, welcomed the deal as one that would protect the Foyles brand and personality as it entered a new chapter. ""I look forward to witnessing the exciting times ahead for the company founded by my grandfather and his brother 115 years ago,"" he said. Foyles has struggled to remain profitable as online booksellers have battered traditional stores. While sales rose last financial year, the company still reported a loss of Â£88,791. Foyles original store was something of a mecca for booklovers, drawn by its history and the promise of browsing the vast stock, in what was once the world's largest bookshop. It pops up in numerousliterary works,external, by authors including Graham Greene, John Le Carre and Ian McEwan. And it has boasted a star-studded clientele, including film actor Richard Burton, who once pilfered books from Foyles and was later horrified to discover that his then wife Elizabeth Taylor - taking a leaf out his own book - had stolen a copy of A Shropshire Lad by poet Alfred Edward Housman. ""It's the first and last thing she ever stole in her life, except, of course, husbands,"" wrote Burton. Perversely, it was partly because the shop was so badly run that it seemed to charm its customers. Books were filed with total disregard to logic, and modern technology including automated tills and computers was stubbornly resisted. Customers were obliged to queue three times to purchase a book. But as Agatha Christie wrote in The Clocks, it was as if the books ""had run wild and taken possession of their habitat"". Waterstoneswas bought by activist investment fund Elliot Advisorsearlier this year, but the new owners retained James Daunt as chief executive. The chain returned to profit under his watch in 2016, and he said the investment by Elliot would lead to more new store openings because the economic downturn had made empty space available in desirable locations. Mr Daunt said the acquisition of Foyles would leave the company ""stronger and better positioned to protect and champion the pleasures of real bookshops in the face of Amazon's siren call"". He said good bookshops were rediscovering their purpose ""in the fight-back against online and e-reading"". The transaction - the terms of which were not disclosed - is expected to be completed before the end of the year.

"Divorce laws in England and Wales are set to be overhauled under government plans seeking to allow couples to split up more quickly and with less acrimony. Justice Secretary David Gauke, who has saidthe system creates ""unnecessary antagonism"",external, is to begin a consultation on introducing ""no-fault"" divorces. Campaigners said it could be a ""landmark moment"" for divorce law. In July, a woman's appeal for divorce wasrejected by the Supreme Courtdue to her husband's refusal to split. Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted to divorce her husband of 40 years on the grounds she is unhappy. Her husband Hugh has refused the split and the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020. Tini Owens was refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Divorce laws 'archaic' says celebrity lawyer The government's proposals - first reported byBuzzfeed,external- could see the concept of fault, or blame, removed from the process. Spouses could lose the right to contest a divorce, as part of the reform. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Pressure has been building for decades for a system of no-fault divorce. The Law Commission recommended it in 1990 and many senior judges favour it. The reason? Many believe that when divorcing couples are being torn apart emotionally and financially, and trying to make living arrangements for their children, assigning blame to one party can only exacerbate an already stressful process. No-fault divorce would have been introduced in a 1996 Act of Parliament requiring spouses to attend ""information meetings"" to encourage reconciliation, but following pilot schemes, the government decided it was unworkable. The Ministry of Justice will seek to end the right of spouses to contest a divorce, and also consult on how long the parties need to wait before becoming entitled to one, suggesting a minimum of six months. Essentially, the government is proposing a notification system where, after a defined period, if one spouse still maintains the marriage has broken down irretrievably, they become entitled to a divorce. There will be some who fear such a system will undermine marriage, but many believe it could remove a layer of stress and anxiety from one of life's most traumatic experiences. Speaking in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the call for reform after recent judgements had been noted and the lord chancellor was ""sympathetic"" to the argument for reform. ""We are looking at ways to reduce conflict in a divorce, whether that can be no-fault, whether that can be under financial provisions, whether that can be for enforceable nuptial agreements,"" she added. Should it be easier to get a divorce? Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? Nigel Shepherd, chairman of the national family lawyer's organisation Resolution, said that couples had been forced ""into needless acrimony and conflict"" under the current system, ""to satisfy an outdated legal requirement"". ""Today's news has the potential to be a landmark moment for divorce law in England and Wales,"" he said. ""The government appears to have heeded our calls to make our divorce system fit for the modern age, and we will continue to push for this much-needed, overdue reform to be implemented as soon as possible."" However, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""Instead of yet another consultation, the Conservatives should get on with changing our divorce laws so that they are fit for the 21st century."" Labour was ""fully committed"" to introducing no-fault divorce proceedings, he added. Jenny from Kent got divorced five years ago. Her husband divorced her on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour because it was quicker than waiting for a no-fault divorce. ""I would have been quite happy to wait for the two years so that we could have had a no-fault divorce,"" she told Radio 5 live. ""The people that got caught in the middle of this were my two children because they went from seeing their parents talking and being quite amenable to each other to having real arguments and being quite nasty to each other - purely because of the process."" Law Society president Christina Blacklaws said it was time to bring divorce law ""into the 21st century"". In Scotland, a simplified divorce procedure is available (to couples without children of the marriage under 16) where people can prove their marriage is broken down with one year's separation - with consent of both partners - or two years separation without consent. In Northern Ireland, the grounds for divorce are the same as the current requirements for England and Wales. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK Divorce laws 'archaic' says celebrity lawyer Wife loses Supreme Court divorce fight New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Billy Crystal and Paris Hilton among celebrities to lose homes in wildfires Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"It isn't clear how hackers boarded BA's website and app - but cyber-security experts have some suggestions British Airways has revealed thathackers managed to breach its website and app,stealing data from many thousands of customers in the process. But how was this possible? BA has not revealed any technical details about the breach, but cyber-security experts have some suggestions of possible methods used. Names, email addresses and credit card details including card numbers, expiry dates and three-digit CVV codes were stolen by the hackers. At first glance,the firm's statement,externalappears to give no details about the hack, but by ""reading between the lines"", it is possible to infer some potential attack routes, says cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey. Take BA's specification of the exact times and dates between which the attack occurred - 22:58 BST, 21 August 2018 until 21:45 BST, 5 September 2018 inclusive. ""They very carefully worded the statement to say anybody who made a card payment between those two dates is at risk,"" says Prof Woodward. ""It looks very much like the details were nabbed at the point of entry - someone managed to get a script on to the website."" Video: British Airways boss promises compensation British Airways hit by 'malicious' data breach This means that as customers typed in their credit card details, a piece of malicious code on the BA website or app may have been furtively extracting those details and sending them to someone else. Prof Woodward points out that this is an increasing problem for websites that embed code from third-party suppliers - it's known as a supply chain attack. Third parties may supply code to run payment authorisation, present ads or allow users to log into external services, for example. Popular events ticketing website Ticketmaster was hit with a data breach earlier this year Such an attack appeared to affect Ticketmaster recently, after an on-site customer service chatbotwas labelled as the potential causeof a breach affecting up to 40,000 UK users. Without further details, there is no way of knowing for sure if something similar has happened to BA. Prof Woodward points out it may just as easily have been a company insider who tampered with the website and app's code for malicious purposes. Because CVV data, the three-digit security code on credit and debit cards, was also taken in the attack, it is indeed likely the details were lifted live, according to Robert Pritchard, a former cyber-security researcher at GCHQ and founder of private firm The Cyber Security Expert.

Prof Woodward added that private firms using third party code on their websites and apps must continually vet such products, to ensure weak points in security don't emerge.

"Divorce lawyer dramaThe Splitcomes to a conclusion on Tuesday while, in the real world, a couple await the verdict in what has been described asthe most significant divorce case of the century. Throughout the UK there is one legal ground for divorce: the ""irretrievable breakdown"" of a marriage. And there are three main reasons you can give to show a marriage has irretrievably broken down: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Separation The first two are about attributing blame. In the case of separation, a couple have to prove only that they have been living apart (and that can include living in the same house provided they are not sharing a bed or living as a couple) for a certain period of time. In England and Wales, it's two years where both the parties agree and five years if one of the couple does not consent to the divorce. Desertion can also be grounds for divorce in England and Wales, if the party has been abandoned for more than two years without agreement or good reason. In Scotland, the waiting period is shorter - one year if both agree and two years if they don't. For the ""fault-based"" grounds, the process can take more like three-to-six months. Separation is sometimes referred to as ""no-fault divorce"" because it doesn't involve ascribing blame to any one party. Couples cannot use adultery as a ground for divorce if they lived together as a couple for six months after the infidelity was known about. And because adultery is classified in law as extra-marital sex between a man and a woman, this reason cannot be used by same-sex couples - they would have to rely on the ""unreasonable behaviour"" argument instead. The figures presented in these charts all relate to opposite-sex couples. Since gay marriage was legalised in 2014, there has been a small number of same-sex couples divorcing (22 in 2015 and 112 in 2016, out of a total of 11,000 same-sex marriages). Many lawyers argue that the UK should move to an entirely ""no fault"" system where instead of having to give one of these reasons, couples could just notify the courts that they wish to divorce and start the process that way. They say that in England and Wales in particular, the waiting time for ""no fault"" divorce - for those couples who rely on separation as their reason - is too long. Law professor Liz Trinder says in Scotland, where there are shorter waiting times for ""no fault"" divorces, just 6% of divorcing couples rely on the fault-based grounds of adultery or unreasonable behaviour. In England and Wales, it's 60%. She believes the long waiting times for a divorce on grounds of separation can encourage couples to attribute blame, to speed matters up, but this makes divorce proceedings more acrimonious. And during the period of separation, it's often difficult for couples to sort out their finances - selling the family home, for example. Shesurveyed about 1,000 divorced people,externaland found 43% who had been identified as being at fault by their spouse disagreed with the reasons cited for the marriage breakdown. She says the judicial system doesn't have time to question the allegations or demand any real proof, meaning accusations go unquestioned, even if the accused denies they have behaved unreasonably or had an affair. ""There's a lot of manipulation of the system and it undermines confidence in the whole thing,"" she says. Some are concerned that speeding up the process could rob people of valuable thinking time in which they might decide not to go through with it. But Professor Trinder says: ""People take a long time to decide before they get to file for divorce. They will already have been thinking about it for a long time."" Family lawyer Kate Landells says fault-based divorce is an ""artificial construct that you have to go through just to start the process"". She says it ""creates an antagonistic start to what is already a really sad time"", although she adds that attributing responsibility can be ""emotionally useful"", especially for the party who feels they've been wronged. ""But it's often not as clear-cut as that,"" she says. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated in 2012 that42% of marriages in England and Wales would end in divorce,external. That's the latest estimate we have of the likelihood of married people getting divorced over the course of their lifetime. But the divorce rate in each individual year is much lower, and has continued to fall since that estimate was produced - from 10.1% of marriages in 2012 to 8.5% in 2015. Fewer of us are getting divorced now,external, and part of that fall is down to fewer people getting married. There are growing numbers, both of single people and of couples living together without tying the knot. However, the divorce rate has also gone down. So it looks like those of us who do choose to marry are more likely to go the distance now than 20 years ago.

"This video can not be played Blair: It's a different Labour Party Tony Blair says he is ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from the left. The former Labour leader told the BBC's Nick Robinson Labour had been through a ""profound change"" under Jeremy Corbyn. ""It is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don't know,"" he said. Mr Corbyn responded: ""I think Tony should recognise that party membership is now much bigger than it has ever been."" Asked about his predecessor's comments, the Labour leader added: ""I've been in the Labour Party all my life. I am a socialist. I am determined to see a fairer and more equal society. ""That's what the Labour Party exists for. We're there for human rights. We're there for social justice. We're there for the future of the people of this country. ""It's not personal, it's about us as a movement. That's why we were founded. That's why the party is so big. And that's why I'm so confident that we are continually challenging this government and we will win a general election."" Why Corbyn supporters want MP selection changes Mr Blair's intervention comes astwo more Corbyn critics lost no-confidence votes by local party membersin their constituencies. Joan Ryan and Gavin Shuker dismissed the votes - which carry no official force in the party - and said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat. Others to have lost similar votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency. Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the cross-party People's Voice campaign for a second EU referendum, has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party,the New Statesman reports,external. Speaking onNick Robinson's Political Thinking Podcast, Mr Blair said: ""I don't think the British people will tolerate a situation where, for example, the choice at the next election is Boris Johnson versus Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn emphasises his party's aspirations following criticism by former PM Tony Blair ""I don't know what will happen and I don't know how it will happen. ""But I just don't believe people will find that, in the country as a whole, an acceptable choice. Something will fill that vacuum."" He said there was a large constituency of voters who backed ""socially liberal, progressive"" politics but also believed in ""a strong private enterprise sector alongside a state that is capable of helping people"". Mr Blair's name has been linked with the formation of a new ""centre ground"" party, although he has never publicly backed the idea. Labour's message to anti-Semitism critics The long march of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party How Tony Blair came to be so unpopular And the former prime minister told Nick Robinson he was not as pessimistic as some of the people around him about the chances of his wing of the party regaining control of Labour. ""There [are] lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party is lost, that the game's over,"" he said. ""I am hoping they are not right."" But he said theanti-Semitism rowthat had engulfed the party was ""bad because it has been, in the end, something that I just can't imagine ever having happened in the Labour Party that I joined"". ""I can't imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,"" Mr Blair said. He said the current Labour leadership came from a left-wing tradition opposed to Western foreign policy. Those belonging to that tradition had always been ""on the margins"" of the party or in a different party, such as the Communists or ""Trotskyist groups"", he added. Mr Blair is a persistent critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership and warned in 2015 the Labour Party risked ""annihilation"" if he became leader. Last yearhe told the BBChe accepted it was ""possible"" that Mr Corbyn could become prime minister, in the wake of the 2017 snap election in which Labour defied predictions of a heavy defeat. Under Mr Corbyn's leadership, party membership has swelled from 388,000 at the end of 2015, to a reported 540,000as of April 2018,external. Under Mr Blair's leadership it reached a peak of 405,000 in 1997 before falling to 198,000 by the time he left Downing Street. Chris Williamson: Labour going from strength-to-strength Labour backbencher Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't really understand what Tony is talking about, the Labour Party now has never been more united. ""We achieved nearly 13m votes in the last election and we are giving hope to millions of people who had become really cynical about politics and inspiring people in a way that I never witnessed in my 42 years as a Labour Party member. ""So I think the party is going frankly from strength to strength."" And Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement, said the party would ""never"" return to Mr Blair's policies. He said on Twitter: ""Tony Blair was never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in UK Labour."" The National Executive Committee member said that Blair-era policies like the minimum wage and Sure Start nurseries should be credited to other leaders. ""Sure Start thanks to Gordon Brown, Min Wage thanks to John Smith, the tragic lost leader we should have had as PM in 1997,"" he wrote.

"Waterstones is buying the 115 year-old family-owned chain Foyles, saying the deal will help to ""champion"" real bookshops in the face of online rivals. The sale includes Foyles' well-known Charing Cross Road store in central London, which was relocated to larger premises in 2014. Waterstones said the deal would help booksellers fight back against Amazon's ""siren call"". The larger chain has 283 bookshops across the UK and northern Europe. Foyles was founded at the turn of the last century by the Foyle family and for more than half a century was run by the famously eccentric Christina Foyle. Her approach included sorting the books by publisher rather than alphabetically, and regularly dismissing staff after a year. Foyles was founded in London in 1903 by brothers William and Gilbert Foyle Her nephew, Christopher Foyle, who took over the company from her, welcomed the deal as one that would protect the Foyles brand and personality as it entered a new chapter. ""I look forward to witnessing the exciting times ahead for the company founded by my grandfather and his brother 115 years ago,"" he said. Foyles has struggled to remain profitable as online booksellers have battered traditional stores. While sales rose last financial year, the company still reported a loss of Â£88,791. Foyles original store was something of a mecca for booklovers, drawn by its history and the promise of browsing the vast stock, in what was once the world's largest bookshop. It pops up in numerousliterary works,external, by authors including Graham Greene, John Le Carre and Ian McEwan. And it has boasted a star-studded clientele, including film actor Richard Burton, who once pilfered books from Foyles and was later horrified to discover that his then wife Elizabeth Taylor - taking a leaf out his own book - had stolen a copy of A Shropshire Lad by poet Alfred Edward Housman. ""It's the first and last thing she ever stole in her life, except, of course, husbands,"" wrote Burton. Perversely, it was partly because the shop was so badly run that it seemed to charm its customers. Books were filed with total disregard to logic, and modern technology including automated tills and computers was stubbornly resisted. Customers were obliged to queue three times to purchase a book. But as Agatha Christie wrote in The Clocks, it was as if the books ""had run wild and taken possession of their habitat"". Waterstoneswas bought by activist investment fund Elliot Advisorsearlier this year, but the new owners retained James Daunt as chief executive. The chain returned to profit under his watch in 2016, and he said the investment by Elliot would lead to more new store openings because the economic downturn had made empty space available in desirable locations. Mr Daunt said the acquisition of Foyles would leave the company ""stronger and better positioned to protect and champion the pleasures of real bookshops in the face of Amazon's siren call"". He said good bookshops were rediscovering their purpose ""in the fight-back against online and e-reading"". The transaction - the terms of which were not disclosed - is expected to be completed before the end of the year.

"Musk was offered a joint by a podcast host during filming in California, where marijuana is legal Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has smoked marijuana live on the web duringa podcast with comedian Joe Rogan,external. Mr Rogan offered his guest the drug, which is legal in California, as the pair discussed tech innovation and the public's perception of Mr Musk. ""I mean, it's legal, right?"" asked the Tesla founder, before taking a drag on the joint. Tesla shares fell more than nine per cent following Mr Musk's appearance on the show. BBC business correspondent Kim Gittleson says the podcast appearance coupled with the departure of a key executive who blamed increasing public scrutiny of the company for his decision to leave has shaken investor confidence in Tesla. Last month, Mr Musk said he was not ""on weed"" when he tweeted about plans to make the electric car company a private firm. The business leader made the comments in an interview with the New York Times. He also told the newspaperhe works ""120-hour weeks"" and takes sedatives. His controversial plans regarding Tesla's ownership were dropped about two weeks later, followingoutrage from some investors. Tesla saw its share price fall after Mr Musk's tweet Elon Musk has certainly had a wild summer. From his frequent tweet storms, to accusing a British rescue diver in Thailand of pedophilia, to a quick u-turn on an effort to take Tesla private - it's no wonder both investors and his closest friends have begun to worry. This latest incident certainly won't allay those concerns. But when it comes to Tesla, the erratic behaviour of Mr Musk might be the least of the company's problems. That's because the electric car maker has consistently struggled to hit its production targets, even as it's taken on more debt. Tesla has long been one of the most bet-against stocks on Wall Street. While that's something that has long frustrated Mr Musk, this certainly won't change that. Tesla's chief accounting officer Dave Morton said he had resigned after only one month in the role, citing ""the level of public attention placed on the company"" among his reasons. The firm's head of HR, Gaby Toledano, also announced she would not rejoin the company after a leave of absence. During the podcast, Mr Rogan offered Mr Musk a joint, which he said contained a mix of tobacco and marijuana - dried leaves and flowering parts of the female cannabis plant. Of 50 US states, recreational cannabis remains illegal in 41 - but it was legalised in California, where the podcast was filmed, in January. ""Is that a cigar?"" asked Mr Musk when his host first proffered the joint. He later added that he ""almost never"" smoked marijuana, noting, ""I don't find that it is very good for productivity"". The pair also enjoyed whiskey during the podcast recording. Mr Musk pointed out: ""Alcohol's a drug."" During their conversation, Mr Musk talked about his health and his management of Tesla - which he said was the most challenging of his various businesses and projects. To close the podcast, Mr Musk was asked if he had any concluding remarks. ""I think people should be nicer to each other,"" he said. ""And giveâ¦ give more credit to others and don't assume they're mean until you know they're actually mean. ""It's easy to demonise people, you're usually wrong about it, people are nicer than you think.""

"The couple have been married for 25 years and have four children Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and his wife Marina Wheeler have confirmed they have separated. In a joint statement, they said they are now in the process of divorcing, after the Sun newspaperbroke the news of their split,external. The couple have been married for 25 years and said the decision was taken some months ago. Mr Johnson, long touted as a future Tory leader, quit the cabinet in July attacking Theresa May's Brexit plan. Profile: Boris Johnson Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis In a joint statement, he and Ms Wheeler said: ""Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate. ""We have subsequently agreed to divorce and that process is under way. ""As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead. ""We will not be commenting further."" Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler, a barrister, married in 1993 and have four children together, Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, a fellow student at Oxford. News of the split follows newspaper allegations about Mr Johnson having had another extra-marital affair. In 2004, the MP was sacked from a shadow ministerial role by then Conservative leader Michael Howard for allegedly lying over an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt - something he had denied as an ""inverted pyramid of piffle"". He fronted the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and joined Theresa May's first cabinet as foreign secretary but quit in July, shortly after his fellow cabinet Brexiteer David Davis resigned, over the prime minister's Chequers plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU. In 2016, following David Cameron's resignation, Mr Johnson dramatically ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, after his fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove's surprise announcement that he would run. But the former mayor of London and current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is widely thought to continue to harbour leadership ambitions. Conservative MP and digital industries minister Margot James, who has criticised the former foreign secretary in the past, said:  ""It is infuriating how Boris Johnson is continuously in the news. ""The prime minister has a really difficult job to do, with the Brexit secretary, to get the best possible deal for this country out of the EU negotiations.

"This video can not be played The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected Turkey's calls for a truce to prevent a ""bloodbath"" in north Syria. At a trilateral meeting with Iran and Turkey, Mr Putin said Russia would continue its fight against ""terrorists"" in Idlib province. Idlib is the Syrian opposition's last major stronghold, with almost three million residents. Syrian military forces, backed by Russia and Iran, are poised to launch a major offensive there soon. The three-way meeting in Tehran had been seen by many as a final chance to prevent a large-scale battle in Idlib. Syria has been in a civil war since 2011, after a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into a conflict that has killed more than 350,000 people. Iran, Russia and Turkey have played central roles in the Syrian conflict. Who's in control of Idlib? Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters Why is there a war in Syria? Turkey - which has long backed some rebel groups - fears an all-out assault will trigger another major refugee crisis on its southern border. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian and Iranian counterparts: ""We don't want Idlib to turn into a bloodbath."" ""Any attack on Idlib would result in a catastrophe. Any fight against terrorists requires methods based on time and patience."" Improvised gas masks are being tried out in Idlib ahead of the expected offensive However, Russia and Iran are allied to Syria's President Assad, and say jihadist groups in Idlib must be wiped out. Russian air strikes, and thousands of fighters backed by Iran, have helped the Syrian military attack rebel areas. At Friday's meeting, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani argued that ""fighting terrorism in Idlib is an unavoidable part of the mission of restoring peace and stability to Syria"". Meanwhile Mr Putin said ""the legitimate Syrian government has a right and must eventually take control of its entire national territory"". What will Trump do next on Syria? The province is the last major stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow Mr Assad for the past seven years. The population of Idlib has been swollen by refugees from other parts of Syria It straddles major highways across Syria - and if it is retaken by the government, would leave the rebels with just a few isolated pockets of territory across the country. The province is not controlled by a single group, but rather by a number of rival factions, including a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda, and a rival National Liberation Front which is backed by Turkey. Up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters are believed to be in Idlib. But the vast majority of Idlib's residents are civilians. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. The UN fears a large-scale offensive in Idlib will lead to a humanitarian disaster. Without a political solution in Syria, ""we will see this war reach new levels of horrors"", the UN special envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said. Meanwhile, the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, said the anticipated conflict would be a ""reckless escalation"", and that ""there is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" Protesters in Idlib demonstrated against the Syrian government and Russia on Friday He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. Mr Jeffrey said a ""major diplomatic initiative"" was now needed, and there was ""a new commitment"" by President Donald Trump to remain involved in Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) was defeated and Iranian fighters left the country. How Idlib may be changing Trump's Syria strategy Mr Jeffrey said President Assad had ""no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not Washington's job to oust him. He said the US would work with Russia on a political transition. The Syrian government has denied ever using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any new chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies.

"This video can not be played The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected Turkey's calls for a truce to prevent a ""bloodbath"" in north Syria. At a trilateral meeting with Iran and Turkey, Mr Putin said Russia would continue its fight against ""terrorists"" in Idlib province. Idlib is the Syrian opposition's last major stronghold, with almost three million residents. Syrian military forces, backed by Russia and Iran, are poised to launch a major offensive there soon. The three-way meeting in Tehran had been seen by many as a final chance to prevent a large-scale battle in Idlib. Syria has been in a civil war since 2011, after a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned into a conflict that has killed more than 350,000 people. Iran, Russia and Turkey have played central roles in the Syrian conflict. Who's in control of Idlib? Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters Why is there a war in Syria? Turkey - which has long backed some rebel groups - fears an all-out assault will trigger another major refugee crisis on its southern border. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian and Iranian counterparts: ""We don't want Idlib to turn into a bloodbath."" ""Any attack on Idlib would result in a catastrophe. Any fight against terrorists requires methods based on time and patience."" Improvised gas masks are being tried out in Idlib ahead of the expected offensive However, Russia and Iran are allied to Syria's President Assad, and say jihadist groups in Idlib must be wiped out. Russian air strikes, and thousands of fighters backed by Iran, have helped the Syrian military attack rebel areas. At Friday's meeting, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani argued that ""fighting terrorism in Idlib is an unavoidable part of the mission of restoring peace and stability to Syria"". Meanwhile Mr Putin said ""the legitimate Syrian government has a right and must eventually take control of its entire national territory"". What will Trump do next on Syria? The province is the last major stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow Mr Assad for the past seven years. The population of Idlib has been swollen by refugees from other parts of Syria It straddles major highways across Syria - and if it is retaken by the government, would leave the rebels with just a few isolated pockets of territory across the country. The province is not controlled by a single group, but rather by a number of rival factions, including a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda, and a rival National Liberation Front which is backed by Turkey. Up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters are believed to be in Idlib. But the vast majority of Idlib's residents are civilians. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. The UN fears a large-scale offensive in Idlib will lead to a humanitarian disaster. Without a political solution in Syria, ""we will see this war reach new levels of horrors"", the UN special envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said. Meanwhile, the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, said the anticipated conflict would be a ""reckless escalation"", and that ""there is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" Protesters in Idlib demonstrated against the Syrian government and Russia on Friday He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. Mr Jeffrey said a ""major diplomatic initiative"" was now needed, and there was ""a new commitment"" by President Donald Trump to remain involved in Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) was defeated and Iranian fighters left the country. How Idlib may be changing Trump's Syria strategy Mr Jeffrey said President Assad had ""no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not Washington's job to oust him. He said the US would work with Russia on a political transition. The Syrian government has denied ever using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any new chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies.

"Givenchy is one of many high fashion brands that said it would stop using fur this year London Fashion Week this year will be completely fur-free for the first time. The event takes place this month and will be the first of the big fashion weeks to get rid of fur. The announcement comes from the British Fashion Council after a survey of the designers included in this year's schedule. It follows the news that Burberry haspledged to stop using real furin its products and will phase out its existing fur items. Gucci is another high fashion brand whichvowed to go fur-freefrom 2018, and the list is growing. Wendy Higgins, Director of Communications for Humane Society International, says this is a ""pivotal moment in the demise of the cruel fur trade"". ""Fur cruelty is no longer welcome on the catwalk at London Fashion Week, and that is a powerful and exhilarating victory for animals that we hope others will follow."" Newsbeat has contacted the British Fur Trade Association for comment. This video can not be played How to tell the difference between real and fake fur MPscalled for a banon the sale of real fur to be considered in July. The issue was investigated by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRA) after it found several high street and online retailers were selling real fur wrongly labelled as fake. These included TK Maxx, BooHoo, Boots, Amazon, Kurt Geiger and Tesco. EFRA described the current labelling of fur products as ""not fit for purpose"" and said that retailers and Trading Standards had become complacent about incorrectly labelled items. A debate on banning fur imports took place in Parliament earlier this year The Labour Party also pledged to ban all fur imports to the UK in June after two separate petitions with more than 500,000 signatures called for government action. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Newsbeat at the time that ""we should not have a fur trade that relies upon the suffering of animals abroad"". Fur farming has been banned in Britain since 2000 but figures show the UK imported almost Â£75m of fur in 2017. Even though the farming of fur is illegal, it's still legal to sell some types of real fur that have been imported from other countries.

"Manglin Pillay said women preferred ""more important enterprises, like family and raising children"" The head of South Africa's civil engineering institution (Saice) has been sacked after he wrote that few women take up the profession because they are ""more predisposed to caring"". Manglin Pillay said that women preferred to ""raise children than to be at the beck and call of shareholders"". He later apologised but Saice said it had terminated his contract due concern from its members. Just 5% of Saice's 6,000 professional members are women. South Africa's Commission for Gender Equality welcomed Mr Pillay's departure saying it would help the ""fight against sexism and objectifying of women"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pillay's originalcomments came in his column in July's edition of Saice's house magazine Civil Engineering,external. He was discussing research on why fewer women than men take up careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Why are there so few female engineers? Career fighting sexism He wrote that ""more men occupy high-profile executive posts... because of appetite for work load and extreme performance requirements at that level"". They attract ""type-A personalities who are disagreeable at times, and highly competitive - workaholics... with almost no family, social or hobby time. ""The reason why women do not occupy these positions is that women choose to rather have the flexibility to dedicate themselves to more important enterprises, like family and raising children, than to be at the beck and call of shareholders"". The comments were criticised in August by South Africa's Science Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, who said that the problem was a lack of support for women and not their attitudes,news site Fin24 reported,external. Mr Pillay was also accused of blaming women for the lack of representation in STEM professions. In the wake of the criticism he issued an apology in August ""for antagonising and offending so many people"". But this was not enough to settle the controversy and Saice's board then decided Mr Pillay had to go. Saice President Errol Kerst said that the response had been so large that the ""ramifications of the article"" could not be ignored. South African Hema Vallabh, who helped found WomEng, which aims to attract women into engineering, said that this was not about a man ""losing his job, but about sending the message that no form of discrimination will be tolerated"".

"Secretary of State Karen Bradley was appointed to the post in January Theresa May has given her backing to Karen Bradley despite her comments about a lack of knowledge of Northern Ireland politics when she took the job. The Northern Ireland Secretary said initially she did not know nationalists did not vote for unionist parties or vice-versa in elections. Mrs Bradley also said she did not fathom some deep-rooted NI issues. Downing Street refused to be drawn on the criteria used by the Prime Minister to appoint ministers. Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament,external. that Northern Ireland was ""a very different world from the world I came from"" and she did not realise campaigns are generally fought within each part of the community. ""I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa."" ""So, the parties fight for election within their own community. ""Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,"" she added. Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire. Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons. ""The Northern Ireland Secretary is working incredibly hard to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland,"" a Number 10 spokeswoman said. Asked if the PM remained confident that Ms Bradley was able to do the job, the spokeswoman replied: ""Yes, she is working very closely with the parties there."" Asked how voters in Northern Ireland could have confidence in Ms Bradley, the spokeswoman replied: ""I would point to all of the work that she is doing to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland."" The South Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MLA MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir criticised Mrs Bradley: ""I knew that Karen Bradley moved particularly slowly when it came to delivering rights and justice to our community, but I didn't realise she was such a slow learner as well."" However, the East Antrim DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said Mrs Bradley's lack of knowledge was understandable. ""Obviously it is going to be a steep learning curve for anyone who is coming into the Northern Ireland brief,"" he said. ""I think actually Karen Bradley was giving an honest answer about what she understood about Northern Ireland before she came in here"" Labour's former Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward told the BBC that Mrs Bradley should have been better informed. He said it was a dangerous thing that Mrs Bradley went into the job ""without understanding the basics"". Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay. Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution. MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888. In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today."" ""I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn't understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland.""

"This video can not be played Cable: Reports of my imminent departure are wide of the mark Sir Vince Cable will stand down as Lib Dem leader ""once Brexit is resolved or stopped""- and wants non-party members to vote for his replacement. In a speech, Sir Vince set out plans to transform the party into a ""movement for moderates"". Party sources say he wants to see this delivered while he is still leader and wants to stay in his job for crucial Brexit developments. He also wants to continue campaigning for a second EU referendum. ""He has a set of objectives rather than a timeline,"" a senior Lib Dem source said. Gina Miller rules out Lib Dem leadership bid Sir Vince Cable 'made mistake' in missing Brexit vote The Lib Dems have 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives and remains in single figures in the opinion polls. Sir Vince has predicted a realignment of British politics, as Labour and the Conservatives split over Brexit and it is thought he wants to ensure the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second EU referendum, are well placed to work with any new ""centre ground"" groups. The former business secretary told an audience in Westminster: ""I think we have to recognise that despite our best efforts, the Liberal Democrats might not be the only centre force in British politics. ""I think it is the worst kept secret in Westminster that political disquiet in the two major parties, is provoking some people to consider a new party of the centre ground, or several. And I think this requires us to demand better than the usual tribalism, whether that is our own or others."" Sir Vince added: ""Liberal democracy itself is under threat notably in the USA, in eastern Europe and perhaps here. Authoritarians and extremists of both right and left are on the march."" This video can not be played The Vince Cable story Analysis by Chief Political Correspondent Vicki Young Some Conservative and many more Labour MPs feel increasingly ill-at-ease with the direction their party is going in. There have been conversations over summer barbecues about creating a new party, or breaking away from the old ones but there's certainly no agreement about what happens next. Tony Blair and Sir Vince Cable share the belief that there are millions of voters on what they call the centre ground who feel homeless. Sir Vince is offering to put a roof over their heads - but it's hard to imagine dozens of Labour MPs sidling over to the Liberal Democrats. The tribal nature of British politics is deeply ingrained. Sir Vince's answer is to open up his party to outsiders in an attempt to attract a broader range of support and maybe a different pool of political talent. He seems to be saying to those who share his liberal values and his anti-Brexit stance, that he can supply the vehicle for their journey. But without an obvious figurehead, it's hard to see how these disparate voices can become more than a crowd of disillusioned politicians, grumbling about the status quo. The Twickenham MP said he wanted to transform the Liberal Democrats from what he called ""an old-style political party"" into a ""movement for moderates"" and had held discussions with some unnamed Labour and Conservative MPs. He advocated a change to the party's rules, so someone who was not an MP could be leader, and ""liberal minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership. He said he did not want to follow in the footsteps of Liberal prime minister William Gladstone, who served into his 80s - or fellow octogenarian leader Robert Mugabe but added: ""Reports I have read of my imminent departure are very wide of the mark. ""Now is not the time for an internal election, there is serious work for me and the party to do. ""Once Brexit is resolved or stopped, that will be the time to conduct a leadership election under the new rules."" His proposed changes would have to be approved by party members and will be discussed at their conference in Brighton later this month. Sir Vince took over as leader in July 2017 without a contest following the resignation of Tim Farron. The Liberal Democrats had 99,200 membersas of August 2018,external. The Labour Partychanged its membership rules under Ed Milibandfrom an electoral college system in which union members, MPs and party members had one-third of the vote each to a ""one member one vote"" system, which allowed ""registered supporters"" to take part for a Â£3 fee. Labour's membership swelled in 2015 and it is thought to have had about 540,000 members as of April 2018, up from around 190,000 in 2014. But there were claims that the new rules were fuelling ""entryism"" - allowing other groups to infiltrate the party in an effort to promote their own agenda. It is thought that Sir Vince plans to rewrite the rules so that supporters need to be enrolled for 12 months before voting, to prevent infiltration by rival parties.

"This video can not be played Britain's representative Karen Pierce and her Russian counterpart Vasily Nebenzya both addressed the UN Russia's threat to the international community is ""real"" and ""active"", the head of GCHQ has warned. Jeremy Fleming's comments came after theUS, France, Germany and Canada agreed with the UKthat Russia was behind the Salisbury Novichok attack. In a speech in Washington, Mr Fleming said Russia's desire to ""undermine"" international law was ""brazen"". At a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". Mr Fleming, the director of the government's cyber intelligence agency, said GCHQ had supported police in a ""painstaking"" and ""highly complex"" investigation into what happened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Wiltshire on 4 March. The UKnamed two men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. The Kremlin called the accusations ""unacceptable"". But Mr Fleming said: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active."" He added: ""And it will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies. Able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus."" Russian spy: What we know so far Russia's scorn for 'cheap soap opera' Could suspects be returned to the UK? What happened to the Skripals? Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Britain's ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, said she was ""really disappointed"" that Russia was refusing to engage or acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. She added that Russia ""often only has a negative agenda"" with regards to international affairs. This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? A statement from Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau and Theresa May said on Thursday: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reiterate our outrage at the use of a chemical nerve agent, known as Novichok, in Salisbury on March 4."" The leaders welcomed progress in the investigation, but urged those with more information to contact the UK authorities. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU,"" the statement added. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries in response to the 4 March attack, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". The leaders said the link to the GRU - revealed on Wednesday - would strengthen their intention to work together against foreign spy networks, the use of chemical weapons, and to ""defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies"". BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg said Russia was ""viewed increasingly as a rogue nation"" by the West, adding that status would ""grate"" with the Kremlin. The UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, alongside China and UK allies the US and France, met in New York to discuss the latest progress in the investigation. Addressing the council, Ms Pierce, said the nerve agent attack was a ""direct challenge"" to the ""rules-based international system that has kept all of us safe since 1945"". In a lengthy rebuttal, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and UK citizens. ""We have lost all hope in finding the truth,"" he said, adding that the latest developments were ""invented out of thin air"". He highlighted a number of so-called ""inconsistencies"", which he said were ""off the charts"", in the UK's evidence. Mrs May told the Commons on Wednesday that the two suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports. The prime minister told MPs the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. Prosecutors in the UK believe there is sufficient evidence to charge the pair with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act. Russia does not extradite its nationals, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the men travel to the EU. Police released CCTV showing the two men arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March On Friday, Wiltshire Council confirmed decontamination work had begun at Mr Skripal's home in Salisbury, where the nerve agent is thought to have been deployed. The council said the work would be carried out by specialist military teams, possibly supported by specialist contractors. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, werepoisoned with Novichokon 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in nearby Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess and harmed her friend Charlie Rowley.

"The Williams family live and work on the wildlife reserve The wife and son of a British scientist are in a critical condition after being attacked by a giraffe on a wildlife reserve in South Africa. Katy Williams and three-year-old Finn were flown to hospital in Johannesburg on Monday after being trampled by a female giraffe who was with her calf. Sam Williams, who works on the Blyde Wildlife Estate, said the giraffe may have seen his wife and son as a threat. In a statement, he said he would ""take one day at a time and remain positive"". His wife and son are said to be in a stable but critical condition in a private hospital in Johannesburg. Trophy hunter criticised for dead giraffe pose Giant python swallows Indonesian woman Elephants relocated from South Africa to Mozambique Both British-born Mr Williams and his American wife (who is also a British resident) are scientists with post-PhD experience in animal-related fields. The family live and work on the reserve in South Africa's Limpopo province. It is understood Mrs Williams, 35, and Finn were attacked at around 18:00 local time on Monday, about 150m from their home. Mr Williams, who was returning from a run, witnessed the attack and was able to chase the giraffe away before calling the emergency services. Giraffes can behave unpredictably if they feel threatened He called the accident an ""unfortunate act of nature"", speculating that the giraffe - which is not a typically aggressive species - had lashed out in defence of her two-month-old calf. Doctors operated on Finn in the early hours of Tuesday morning, to relieve pressure in his brain due to injuries sustained in the attack. ""Dr Sam Williams would like to thank all doctors and medical personal from the hospital for their efforts to give his wife and son the best chance to heal,"" said the statement issued by Marina Botha, the lawyer representing the family. ""The family said that they have decided to take one day at a time and to remain positive."" Riaan Cilliers, the manager of the Blyde Wildlife Estate, said: ""We are all in shock about this very sad incident and we ensure the family that they are in our prayers.""

"Presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, pictured seconds after being stabbed in the stomach The front-runner in Brazil's presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, has been stabbed at a campaign rally. The far-right politician was attacked in a crowd in the south-east state of Minas Gerais. A suspect was arrested. Mr Bolsonaro had surgery for injuries to his intestines and is expected to recover, hospital officials said. The controversial politician, who has outraged many in Brazil with racist and homophobic comments, has performed strongly in recent opinion polls. The polls suggest he will get the most votes in the first round of the October presidential elections if former President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva remains blocked from standing, but he is unlikely to win a run-off. Left-wing Lula had been the long-standing favourite buthe is currently in prison, appealing against a ban on his candidacy that was imposed after his conviction for corruption. 'Brazil's Trump' enters presidential race Some of Mr Bolsonaro's past comments have caused uproar, including equating homosexuality with paedophilia, and saying a congresswoman was too ugly to be raped. Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, SÃ£o Paulo This is another twist - a dramatic one - in what has already been a turbulent campaign for one of Brazil's most uncertain elections in decades. The front-runner Lula is unlikely to be able to run because he's locked up in prison. Jair Bolsonaro is expected to win the first round in his absence, but he is in a hospital bed. It is a surreal situation. One of Jair Bolsonaro's key campaign messages is that he will try to turn around the growth in violent crime. The fact that he is now a victim himself plays into the hands of his supporters, who see this as a very important problem for Brazil to tackle. Everyone - including his detractors - has rallied around him to condemn the attack. As it has happened so close to the October election, he won't be on the campaign trail for the next week or so. Nevertheless, his supporters will be strengthened, seeing that his concerns are their concerns. Footage of the incident in the city of Juiz de Fora shows Mr Bolsonaro making a thumbs-up gesture and being held aloft by supporters when he is stabbed with what appears to be a knife. He then doubles over with pain and his supporters quickly lower him to the ground and bundle him into a car. After the attack, his son Flavio tweeted: ""Unfortunately it was more serious than we had expected. He lost a lot of blood, arrived at the hospital with a [blood] pressure of 10/3, almost dead. His condition now seems stabilised. Pray, please!"" Hospital officials later said Mr Bolsonaro had suffered a ""deep"" and life-threatening stab wound in his intestines and was in a ""serious but stable"" condition. Military police released a picture of the man suspected of stabbing Mr Bolsonaro He was recuperating well in intensive care after two hours of surgery, they added, but would spend at least a week to 10 days in hospital. He has since been filmed in his hospital bed, making a hoarse statement. He described how what he thought was ""just a blow"" turned into an unbearable pain. He had ""never hurt anyone"", he said. Police said a suspect had been arrested, naming him as Adelio Obispo de Oliveira, 40. Officials quoted by Reuters news agency said he appeared to be mentally disturbed. He was manhandled and beaten by angry supporters of Mr Bolsonaro before being taken into custody. Stabbing suspect Adelio Obispo de Oliveira was grabbed by members of the crowd It took the crowd some moments to realise Jair Bolsonaro, top right, had been stabbed Mr Bolsonaro's electoral rivals have all condemned the stabbing. Fernando Haddad, who is expected to replace Lula on the Workers' Party ticket, said the attack was ""absurd and regrettable"". Speaking in the capital Brasilia, President Michel Temer said such an attack was ""intolerable"" in a democratic state and that he hoped Mr Bolsonaro recovered soon. The president's predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, warned that the attack must not go unpunished. Brazilian stocks rose after the attack on Mr Bolsonaro, as it was seen as increasing his chances. His free-market economics make him popular with investors. Supporters of Mr Bolsonaro in Sao Paulo held a vigil for him The 63-year-old, who is representing the Social Liberal Party (PSL), is followed by millions of Brazilians on social media, and many refer to him as the ""Brazilian Trump"". Brazil's unlikely young conservatives He also supports loosening gun control laws, and is backed by millions of evangelical Christians for his uncompromising anti-abortion stance. A former army captain, Mr Bolsonaro entered politics in the 1980s to defend the rights of military personnel. Few imagined at that time that he could become a serious contender. But the collapse of the Workers' Party government and the impeachment of President Rousseff two years ago revealed the extent of political divisions. Mr Bolsonaro has performed strongly in polls ahead of next month's election Mr Bolsonaro's outspoken rhetoric and his defence of law and order appealed to many who blamed the left for corruption and the economic crisis. In 2011, he told Playboy magazine that he would be ""incapable of loving a gay son"" and that he would rather see such a son of his ""die in an accident"". In 2015, he was fined for saying in a newspaper interview that Congresswoman Maria do Rosario was ""not worth raping; she is very ugly"". He is currently being investigated for alleged racism over derogatory remarks he made about Afro-Brazilians. President Temer, an unpopular leader, is not standing for re-election, and millions of voters remain undecided. Mr Bolsonaro is expected to have a strong first round but lose a run-off to leftist Ciro Gomes, environmentalist Marina Silva or ex-Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, according to leading research company Ibope. A race against Lula's likely replacement, Fernando Haddad, could be much narrower. Ibope said its most recent survey showed Mr Bolsonaro losing to him by just one percentage point. Mr Haddad was charged with corruption earlier this week and, like Lula, denies any wrongdoing. On Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected Lula's latest appeal to run. The Workers' Party has until the end of Tuesday to register Mr Haddad as its presidential candidate.

"The words ""Class War"" were spray painted on the new Tarmac Residents in a road where a spike-topped wall once divided rich and poor have slammed a decision to lay new Tarmac only at the ""posh"" end of the street. The fresh surface, in Wentworth Road, Oxford, was spray-painted with the words ""class war"" after it appeared. Those in neighbouring Aldrich Road said the work stopped at the point where the Cutteslowe Walls stood. Oxford City Council said the decision was based on need. Rachel, who did not want to give her surname, has lived in Aldrich Road for 30 years. She said: ""The council should have resurfaced the whole road. They've gone right to where the wall was so I can understand why people are angry about it. ""By doing this they've caused a massive issue. I'm angry about it but spraying graffiti over the road is not on."" Built in 1934 at the point where Aldrich Road became Wentworth Road. They were more than two metres high and topped with spikes The two structures divided the Cutteslowe estate from private housing built by developer Clive Saxton, who feared his homes would not sell with ""slum"" dwellers as neighbours Many attempts by protesters and the council to remove them were foiled, until 1953, when local authorities were given powers of compulsory purchase Finally, on 9 March 1959, after the city had purchased the strips of land on which the walls stood, they came down. Another resident, Liz Patterson, said: ""It's possible our road didn't need doing, but given the history you can understand why people might feel like that. ""This is a small community, there are pockets of poverty. ""The resurfacing stops right on the divide so of course people are going to question that. It's absurd. ""When I saw it I thought: 'I'm obviously on the wrong side of the road'. ""While I can see some humour in it, others are upset."" Oxford City Council said: ""Oxford Direct Services resurfaced Wentworth Road earlier this year. ""The decision to resurface this road was purely based on need. ""The structural condition was far worse in Wentworth Road and this led to the decision to resurface this road first.""

"Trainee teacher Rhiannon Smith was killed in a car crash - nobody was charged for what was seen as a tragic accident The father of a woman killed in a car crash said he would ""find it hard to live with"" himself if he was involved in a similar fatal incident. Julian Smith said the loss of Rhiannon, 21, has changed his attitude to driving and he wants action to cut road deaths. Trainee teacherMiss Smith was killed as she tried to turn onto the A48near Llandevaud in Newport. The Welsh Government said while progress to reduce deaths had been made, there was work to be done. ""What has happened to me over the past 18 months has been devastating,"" Mr Smith toldBBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales. His grief has led to him totally changing the way he approaches driving because he said would find it hard ""to live with"" or ""justify"" being responsible for another family experiencing a similar loss. In 2017, police forces in Wales recorded 4,556 road accidents involving personal injury, 7.4% fewer than in 2016. Over the same period, 103 people were killed on Welsh roads - the same as in 2016 - while 961 people were seriously injured, a reduction of 43. Rhiannon's parents have described how ""disturbing"" it has been losing their daughter in this way Mr Smith described having a ""much wider perception of the dangers"" and a more conservative approach now. This includes never using a mobile phone in his car, never going over the speed limit and always giving himself plenty of time to arrive at a destination. He said that like with rail and air, there should be a system in place to review and learn from road crashes to help stop further accidents. Miss Smith, a Cardiff University graduate was finishing her PGCE at the University of Gloucestershire and had applied for a job as a teacher in London when she was killed. The incident in March 2017, happened when she had to drive around a car parked on the side of the road and join the A48, which has a 50mph (80kmh) speed limit. There were no charges for what was seen as a tragic accident and while Newport council has stopped cars parking in the area, Mr Smith wants the speed limit cut. Special police team 'could cut crashes' Call for Â£200m 'high risk' road spending Driving home? 10 things to know about roads Alongside his wife Gill, he will host a special road safety conference in Newport on Friday, calling for greater measures to prevent further fatalities. ""With my daughter's collision it was the realisation of the numbers that die on the roads and to encourage local and national government to recognise their obligations,"" Mr Smith added. ""In the past there has been talk of hitting zero deaths, but very little talk recently whatsoever."" Julian Smith said young people in particular may not realise the impact of dangerous driving More speed reduction schemes, further safety tests and the creation of a specialist collision investigation team,which Newport East MP Jessica Morden previously raised in parliament, will be called for at the conference later. A Welsh Government spokesman said it had had targets in place since 2013, when the Road Safety Framework for Wales was published. ""In 2017 we made good progress towards the targets for an overall reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) (24.3% reduction on the 2004-08 baseline) and in the numbers of young people KSI (40.7% reduction on the 2004-08 baseline),"" he said. ""There is more work to be done and we will continue to encourage road safety schemes across Wales."" This video can not be played ""So much more can be done"" to stop fatal car crashes According to a report by theEuropean Commission,external, Sweden and the UK have the safest roads in Europe. ""Britain has some of the safest roads in the world and the number of fatalities has fallen by 44% over the last ten years - however we are determined to do more,"" a Department for Transport spokesman said.

"The fear of a migraine makes it more likely to occur, says Yasmin Coutinho Yasmin Coutinho, 23, has suffered from migraines since she was seven, and they have ruined some of the best moments of her life. ""Aged seven I got a migraine during my parents' wedding. I was the flower girl and it ruined the whole weekend. ""Ever since then I've been anxious about attacks in important moments and it's a vicious cycle, as stress and anxiety increase the likelihood of having a migraine. ""In a way, the migraines are almost psychological, although unfortunately they manifest physically,"" she says. Yasmin sufferers from migraines three to four times a month. Her attacks last around three days and she describes the pain as like being shot in the head. Invariably she vomits, fluid comes from her nose, and she has sensitivity to light and sound. It's completely debilitating. Last year, during her graduation, the fear and anxiety prompted another attack. ""It came on during the night before. I woke up at 04:00 in a lot of pain. ""Four years ago I was finally prescribed medication after years of suffering, so I took those meds, and I was able to get some relief for a couple of hours. ""Migraines have ruined some of the best moments of my life"" ""There are side effects from the meds, but at least I can just about function. I continued to take the meds throughout the day and I was able to complete my graduation, but that worry is always there. ""I travel quite often, and I am always scared that I will get a migraine on a plane. ""Migraines have ruined some of the best moments of my life."" Yasmin's experience chimes with the results of a new survey of 690 migraine sufferers in the UK, which showed that more than two-thirds of them live in fear of an attack. Nichola West, a mother of three from Bath, also suffers from anxiety about getting a migraine, as she actually loses her vision for about 20 to 30 minutes before a headache starts. Nichola West is in daily fear of a migraine because she loses her sight before it starts ""I get migraines with aura, which is where I lose my eyesight, or it gets very blurry. It's a horrible sensation. The first one I had was when I was pregnant with my youngest son. ""I had to go to hospital, they didn't know if I was having a stroke. ""I'm always on edge, because if one comes on, I can't see, the lack of vision lasts for about 20 to 40 minutes. I have three kids, and I have been out shopping with them and it just came on, and I had to get my oldest son, to lead me out of the shop and get me to a bench. ""I've had to talk to my children about what to do if I get an attack,"" Nichola told theVictoria Derbyshireprogramme. The survey, conducted for drug company Novartis between September 2017 and February 2018, analysed data from sufferers who had four or more migraine attacks a month. It found that in the UK, 71% of people have to rely on external support to cope with everyday tasks.

"Secretary of State Karen Bradley was appointed to the post in January Theresa May has given her backing to Karen Bradley despite her comments about a lack of knowledge of Northern Ireland politics when she took the job. The Northern Ireland Secretary said initially she did not know nationalists did not vote for unionist parties or vice-versa in elections. Mrs Bradley also said she did not fathom some deep-rooted NI issues. Downing Street refused to be drawn on the criteria used by the Prime Minister to appoint ministers. Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament,external. that Northern Ireland was ""a very different world from the world I came from"" and she did not realise campaigns are generally fought within each part of the community. ""I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa."" ""So, the parties fight for election within their own community. ""Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,"" she added. Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire. Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons. ""The Northern Ireland Secretary is working incredibly hard to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland,"" a Number 10 spokeswoman said. Asked if the PM remained confident that Ms Bradley was able to do the job, the spokeswoman replied: ""Yes, she is working very closely with the parties there."" Asked how voters in Northern Ireland could have confidence in Ms Bradley, the spokeswoman replied: ""I would point to all of the work that she is doing to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland."" The South Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MLA MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir criticised Mrs Bradley: ""I knew that Karen Bradley moved particularly slowly when it came to delivering rights and justice to our community, but I didn't realise she was such a slow learner as well."" However, the East Antrim DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said Mrs Bradley's lack of knowledge was understandable. ""Obviously it is going to be a steep learning curve for anyone who is coming into the Northern Ireland brief,"" he said. ""I think actually Karen Bradley was giving an honest answer about what she understood about Northern Ireland before she came in here"" Labour's former Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward told the BBC that Mrs Bradley should have been better informed. He said it was a dangerous thing that Mrs Bradley went into the job ""without understanding the basics"". Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay. Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution. MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888. In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today."" ""I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn't understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland.""

"This video can not be played The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage The new US envoy for Syria has said there is ""lots of evidence"" that Syrian government forces are preparing to use chemical weapons in Idlib. Jim Jeffrey said an anticipated offensive against the last major rebel-held area would be a ""reckless escalation"", Reuters reported. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied ever using chemical weapons. Russian planes have bombed rebel areas in the north-western region as troops mass for the expected offensive. Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters How Idlib may be changing Trump's Syria strategy Why is there a war in Syria? It comes as a summit is due to take place in Iran on Friday between the leaders of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Turkey, which has backed some rebel factions. The UN has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if an all-out assault takes place and Turkey fears a new influx of refugees across its border. Improvised gas masks are being tried out in Idlib ahead of the expected offensive ""I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings,"" Mr Jeffrey said in his first interview since being appointed. ""Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation. There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies. Despite Syrian denials, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said they are confident government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. The population of Idlib has been swollen by refugees from other parts of Syria Mr Jeffrey said a ""major diplomatic initiative"" was now needed to end the seven-year civil war. He said there was ""a new commitment"" by President Donald Trump to remain involved in Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) was defeated and to ensure that Iranian fighters - who are supporting the Syrian authorities in the conflict - leave the country. Mr Jeffrey said President Assad had ""no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not Washington's job to oust him. He said the US would work with Russia on a political transition. ""Right now [the Syrian government] is a cadaver sitting in rubble with just half the territory of Syria under regime control on a good day,"" he added. With rebel forces defeated in most of Syria, the offensive in the north-western province of Idlib could prove to be the last major battle of the seven-year civil war. Who's in control of Idlib? There are believed to be up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters in Idlib. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically. Syria: Who's in control of Idlib?

"The couple have been married for 25 years and have four children Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and his wife Marina Wheeler have confirmed they have separated. In a joint statement, they said they are now in the process of divorcing, after the Sun newspaperbroke the news of their split,external. The couple have been married for 25 years and said the decision was taken some months ago. Mr Johnson, long touted as a future Tory leader, quit the cabinet in July attacking Theresa May's Brexit plan. Profile: Boris Johnson Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis In a joint statement, he and Ms Wheeler said: ""Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate. ""We have subsequently agreed to divorce and that process is under way. ""As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead. ""We will not be commenting further."" Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler, a barrister, married in 1993 and have four children together, Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, a fellow student at Oxford. News of the split follows newspaper allegations about Mr Johnson having had another extra-marital affair. In 2004, the MP was sacked from a shadow ministerial role by then Conservative leader Michael Howard for allegedly lying over an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt - something he had denied as an ""inverted pyramid of piffle"". He fronted the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and joined Theresa May's first cabinet as foreign secretary but quit in July, shortly after his fellow cabinet Brexiteer David Davis resigned, over the prime minister's Chequers plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU. In 2016, following David Cameron's resignation, Mr Johnson dramatically ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, after his fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove's surprise announcement that he would run. But the former mayor of London and current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is widely thought to continue to harbour leadership ambitions. Conservative MP and digital industries minister Margot James, who has criticised the former foreign secretary in the past, said:  ""It is infuriating how Boris Johnson is continuously in the news. ""The prime minister has a really difficult job to do, with the Brexit secretary, to get the best possible deal for this country out of the EU negotiations. ""I'm frankly fed up with talking about Boris Johnson"".

"Parents in England are not getting the assurance they need about the quality of education their children are receiving, a committee of MPs warns. It is unacceptable that so many schools - previously rated outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted - are exempt from being reinspected, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says. PAC says cuts to Ofsted's budget mean families cannot make informed choices. Ofsted says it is confident inspections offer parents the assurance they need. Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said it was maintaining ""excellent levels of assurance"" despite its budget being more than halved. ""One might think that a parliamentary committee that was responsible for public money would be pleased that we had put so much effort into staying within our means. It would certainly be the first to roast us if we didn't,"" she said. The PAC report highlights a number of concerns, saying: it is ""unacceptable"" that so many schools are exempt from being reinspected and so have not been inspected for six years or more short inspections do not allow inspectors enough time to make a ""meaningful assessment"" of a school's performance or help schools improve inspectors do not give parents enough opportunity to contribute their views about the school the system for school accountability and improvement is muddled, leading to confusion for schools and parents the watchdog has struggled to employ enough inspectors, so has failed to complete its inspection programme Ofsted is not enough of a ""force for school improvement"" The committee acknowledges funding issues. ""We recognise that Ofsted's budget has been cut significantly in recent years, and the amount it spent on inspecting the schools sector fell by 52% in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2017-18. ""However, this has led Ofsted and the Department for Education to focus narrowly on the cost of inspection, rather the value of getting independent assurance about schools' effectiveness."" The report also criticises the watchdog for incorrectly stating in its annual report for 2016-17 that it had met the statutory target for reinspecting schools every five years, when it had actually failed to do this for 43 schools. Under legislation, schools that Ofsted has previously rated as outstanding are exempt from routine reinspections - unless the watchdog identifies a particular risk. As at August 2017, 1,620 schools had not been inspected for six years or more, including 296 schools that had not been inspected for 10 years or more. Some 'outstanding schools not that good' Ofsted chief backs school phones ban The PAC report says: ""As a result, some pupils go through the whole of primary and/or secondary school without any independent assessment of their school's effectiveness."" Earlier this year, the National Audit Office warned that Ofsted's ""effectiveness has reduced"" as a result of the decision by the Department for Education and the watchdog to end routine inspections for these schools. Meg Hillier, the committee's chairwoman, said: ""Cuts to Ofsted's budget have undermined families' ability to make informed decisions about schools. ""If the level of inspection continues to be eroded there is a risk that Ofsted will come to be perceived by parents, Parliament and taxpayers as not relevant or worse, simply a fig leaf for government failures on school standards. ""Should this happen, its credibility will evaporate."" Ofsted's chief inspector Ms Spielman, said: ""As with all of the public sector, we have had to do more with less. ""However, I remain confident that our inspections provide parents, schools and the government with the assurance they need about school standards and that we do so in a way that compares very favourably in terms of quality and value for money with school inspection regimes internationally,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""However, we have reached the limit in terms of being able to provide that level of assurance within our current funding envelope. ""That is why, with our ongoing framework review, we are looking at how to ensure that schools and parents get everything they need from our reports, and why many of the committee's recommendations are already long in train."" Ms Spielman added that she would continue to speak out on issues in the sector, such as the dangers of illegal unregistered schools, the risks of radicalisation, the narrowing of the curriculum and the importance of early literacy.

"Two Labour MPs who lost no-confidence votes among local party members have told constituents they will not quit. Former minister Joan Ryan, MP for Enfield North, blamed the 94-92 vote defeat on ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"". Luton South MP Gavin Shuker said he was ""sorry a handful of people"" wanted to overturn his 2017 win. Both are among MPs to have criticised Jeremy Corbyn and faced no confidence votes in their local parties. Others include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties, Kate Hoey, who has voted with the government on Brexit, and another Brexit-backing Labour MP Graham Stringer, who won his no confidence vote. Why Corbyn supporters want MP selection changes Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Frank Field resigns Labour whip In July, Momentum's national co-ordinator Laura Parker suggested Ms Hoey, Mr Stringer, Mr Field and John Mann - who also backs Brexit - should be deselected,saying there was ""no room"" for them in the party.,external No confidence votes carry no official force within the Labour party but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election. Ms Ryan, who chairs the Labour Friends of Israel group and has been critical of Mr Corbyn, said on Twitter: ""Just to be clear, I am not resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values."" She added that losing 92 to 94 votes was ""hardly a decisive victory"": ""It never occurred to me that Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left would [have] confidence in me. I have none in them."" The vote was covered by Iranian station Press TV, which published video on its Twitter feed.

Labour says the party under Mr Corbyn is giving a voice and hope to communities that have been held back and ignored for years In 2012, Ofcom revoked Press TV's licence to broadcast in the UK, for breaching rules about editorial control over the channel. It said there was an impressionthat decisions were being controlled by the offices in Tehran, not the UK. Meanwhile Mr Shuker tweeted a message to his constituents about the vote in his constituency: ""It's not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South. ""I'm really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today's Labour Party. ""I've not changed, but the Labour Party has."" Earlier, Labour peer Lord Blunkett said that both he and former deputy leader Lord Hattersley had complained to the party's general secretary about the activities of Corbyn ally Chris Williamson, who he said was putting some MPs under ""enormous pressure"" with threats of deselection. Mr Williamson who has been travelling around Labour constituencies with other prominent supporters of Mr Corbyn to make the case for greater democracy and accountability within the party - has rejected claims he is doing it to push for the removal of critics of the party leader. But Lord Blunkett told the BBC: ""It would be better if he would spend time in Conservative seats fighting the Tories or defending the very tiny majority he has in Derby North, rather than deselecting his colleagues,"" Lord Blunkett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Lord Blunkett called on ""decent people in the Labour Party"" to ""stand up and take action"". Earlier, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC it was a ""different type of Labour Party"" under Jeremy Corbyn adding: ""Can it be taken back? I don't know."" ""There are lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party's lost, that the game's over. I'm kind of hoping they're not right.""

"This video can not be played Tony Blair told Newsnight's Ian Katz it was ""possible"" that Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister Tony Blair says he now accepts Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister. The ex-PM told BBC Newsnight that a year ago he would have said it was impossible for the left-wing Labour leader to win. But he added: ""There's been so many political upsets, it's possible Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister and Labour could win on that programme."" Mr Blair, a consistent critic of Mr Corbyn, said he had not changed his mind on the ""wisdom"" of electing him. Having defied predictions of a heavy defeat at last month's general election - and stripped the Conservatives of their majority - Mr Corbyn now describes his party as a ""government-in-waiting"". Many of his critics have since admitted they underestimated him. Speaking to Newsnight, Mr Blair said he still believed ""it's a surer route to power to fight from the centre"" and that it would be damaging for the country if Mr Corbyn became prime minister and imposed ""an unreconstructed far Left programme"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I hope he (Tony Blair) has looked very carefully at our manifesto"" But on Mr Corbyn's chances of reaching Downing Street, he said nothing could be ruled out. ""For most of my political life I've been saying: 'I think this is the right way to go, and what's more it's the only way to win an election'. ""I have to qualify that now.  I have to say 'no - I think it's possible you end up with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.'"" The Labour leadership has dismissed Mr Blair's recent interventions - which included claiming Brexit followed by a Corbyn government would leave Britain ""flat on its back"". ""To be frank, Mr Blair hasn't really listened to the nature of the debate that is going on in the pubs, the clubs and school gates etc,"" shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on Saturday.

"Jeremy Corbyn salutes the crowds at Labour Live, the party's music and politics festival ""Things can change - and they will."" A hopeful, positive message. Or a warning? These words were uttered by Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn at the special conference on 12 September 2015 when he decisively defeated the three other candidates. I was in the room at the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in central London - an odd place perhaps for a republican to be ""crowned"" party leader, perhaps. But it proved convenient for Jeremy Corbyn as it was within yards of a pro-refugee demonstration in Parliament Square which he addressed soon afterwards. His election was greeted by the strangest mixture of elation and trepidation. Three years on, and there is little doubt that he has changed his party. Speaking this month at the Labour Live event on home turf in north London he declared: ""The Labour Party is now 550,000 members - the biggest in my lifetime. ""We are a proud and determined party. We need and can do things differently."" In the final edition of BBC Radio 4's documentary seriesThe Long March of Corbyn's LabourI've looked at how the party's membership has changed, the implications of this for policy - and how a mass membership party can bring challenges as well as opportunities. Under a cut-price supporters' scheme introduced by Corbyn's predecessor Ed Miliband, people who had felt either alienated by mainstream politics or who had been to the left of the Labour leadership signed up to back the insurgent in the 2015 leadership contest. Once Corbyn was on the ballot, his campaign manager John McDonnell coined the phrase ""straight-talking honest politics"" - portraying him as a refreshing change from career politicians and the former ministers and special advisers who were his opponents. Having been an MP since 1983 and a councillor before that, it could of course be argued that Corbyn, too, was a career politician. But he looked and sounded different. And some of those who signed up to support him stayed on - becoming full members and, as it turned out, a bulwark against a sceptical - even hostile - Parliamentary Labour Party. Labour membership is falling back a bit now and confidential internal projections which we have seen - and which are used for financial planning purposes - predict it will decrease to around 500,000 by the end of the year. But this is still two-and-a-half times bigger than when the party boasted of its ""ground force"" in the disastrous 2015 election campaign. Soon after Corbyn's victory, a veteran of the party's left - Jon Lansman - was approached to set up, rather ambitiously, a whole new movement: Momentum. Lansman had been a key figure - nearly 40 years previously - in Tony Benn's campaign for Labour's deputy leadership. Momentum's aim in the short term was to ensure that Corbyn wasn't toppled. ""It was founded out of his leadership campaign,"" Lansman said. ""I was asked to do that job by John McDonnell, with the consent of Jeremy. As a result of that, we created something which looks actually very different from anything else on the Left - inside or outside of the Labour Party."" Corbyn initially put together a reasonably broad-based shadow cabinet but at local level, the party was changing. Lucy Powell  was chief of staff to Ed Miliband when he led Labour and, not long after he lost power, she witnessed a party in a state of metamorphosis. Looking through Labour's archives with Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell I met her in her Manchester Central constituency - and chose as a rendezvous the People's History Museum on the banks of the River Irwell. Deep in the basement of the museum is where the Labour Party stores its national archives. Here you can see letters signed by Labour's first leader Keir Hardie (rather like contemporary leaders, he was drumming up financial support from the unions). In more recent correspondence, Peter Mandelson and pollster Philip Gould discussed a review of party policy under Neil Kinnock - a prototype of the New Labour project. Lucy Powell told me she brought Jeremy Corbyn here when she had, briefly, been in his shadow cabinet. Although already reshaping the party for the future, he was fascinated by its past. She told me: ""Jeremy's staff were having kittens because he had to go to another function. He just didn't want to leave."" The archive also contains records of disciplinary cases and expulsions - underlining that the party has been riven many times by factional struggles before. Sadly, the minutes of Parliamentary Labour Party meetings are closed for the next two decades so we can't read for ourselves of the fractious meetings between Corbyn and his sceptical MPs. Festival-goers relax during Labour Live Lucy Powell herself left one of those meetings two years ago in some distress. She told me of the culture shock in her constituency when new members flooded in to support Jeremy Corbyn. ""My constituency membership went up from 600 to 700 three years ago to over 2,300, it's now gone down a bit again. ""It quadrupled in size, and that has brought great challenges as well as real opportunities... there was a bit of 'us and them' about it originally, with the older members calling newer members 'hard-left trots' and newer members calling the older members 'right-wing Blairites'."" Now though, she insists members are working more co-operatively together: ""We've definitely come through that and a lot of those relationships have now been established, but it was definitely difficult for a while."" John Stolliday was until this month one of Labour's most senior officials - the director of governance and legal. He announced his resignation when Jeremy Corbyn's supporters tightened their grip on the party machine and installed a new general secretary, in overall charge of the party's head office. He joined Labour HQ 14 years ago, serving four party leaders - and had a broad overview of the changing nature of the party. The local battles being fought within Labour What Momentumâs wins might mean for Labour Momentum director wins Labour disputes role Giving his first-ever interview, he described the rise in membership in 2015 as ""extraordinary.... no one saw it coming"". But who were these new members? ""There were many young people who have never been members of political parties and who felt genuinely enthused by Jeremy and his message."" But, he explained, they weren't all political virgins. ""There are many people who have joined from other political parties, from the Lib Dems, the Greens, the rag tag assortment of far-left parties and the Trade Union Socialist Coalition... and then also people who were members under Blair and then left because of the Iraq war."" And there is a bit of snag about where the new members are geographically, rather than politically. ""They are concentrated in London and the south east of England. That's a problem. ""For Labour to get into power, it absolutely has to win the constituencies with the smallest Tory majorities."" ""They are in the Midlands and the M6 corridor in the North. They are home to many working class people. ""And for some reason these people are not turning out to vote for the Labour Party - or indeed to join it."" But the new members were certainly in the right place at the right time for Jeremy Corbyn in Labour's internal battles. In his first six months as leader, party membership was rising but Jeremy Corbyn's political stock was falling. Behind in the polls, he looked vulnerable. But it was an attempt to oust him that solidified him in power. After what was seen as at best a lacklustre campaign on his part to keep Britain in the EU in 2016, his internal opponents made a move - but also made a series of miscalculations. The Parliamentary Labour Party decided they had no confidence in their leader. Eighty per cent of MPs opposed him, and many of the better-known faces left his shadow cabinet. Two assumptions had been made by his critics, and both turned out be wrong. The first was that having lost the confidence of so many of his MPs Corbyn would feel under a certain responsibility to resign. Jeremy Corbyn comfortably saw off Owen Smith's leadership challenge in 2016 There seems little doubt he considered this, but those close to him say he didn't want to let down the members who had elected him. The second was that - in line with legal advice party officials had obtained - if his leadership was challenged, he would need 20% of MPs and MEPs - around 50 elected politicians - to nominate him to get on the ballot paper. It was assumed this would be too high a threshold to meet. In fact, in the end Labour's national executive - which wasn't under his full control at that moment - narrowly voted to put him on the ballot automatically without the need for nominations, and a subsequent legal challenge to this failed. Compounding this, his opponents couldn't agree a candidate and there was an internal contest within the parliamentary party between Angela Eagle and Owen Smith. Lucy Powell - one of those who resigned from Corbyn's shadow cabinet - regrets the move: ""It was a really big mistake. It was a collective misjudgement of what action should have been taken at the time. ""It wasn't a plan. In fact if it had been a plan, it would have been a rubbish plan. It was a domino effect that took hold really, really quickly."" And John Stolliday also believes that emotion rather than wisdom prevailed. Membership had been falling from its peak and he thinks some of the newer members may have gone - or lost interest  - if a leadership contest had come later: ""I understand why the challenge came. But the MPs who led that challenge seemed to not realise the strength of feeling amongst the membership. ""They forgot that many members of the Labour Party joined in 2015 to support Jeremy Corbyn. ""When people joined the Labour Party they join on a year's contract. ""For many people that would have expired in the summer, members were already dropping off by the time of the referendum in June. ""The effect of the challengeâ¦ was to invigorate and electrify members."" This was the Left's moment. The push against Corbyn was portrayed as a putsch -  a coup against the membership. And Jon Lansman, Momentum's founder, said the Left could no longer be quite so relaxed about who controlled the levers of power in the party. ""We expected it to come. And whilst Jeremy set out to be inclusive, we prepared for it."" Momentum was initially riven with factional strife - and a debilitating debate over whether its activists also had to be fully paid-up Labour members. As Lansman put it: ""Any start-up organisation goes through a painful period of creating itself."" But with a threat to Corbyn, enmities could be buried or shelved - and those on the Left could come together in common cause. That summer, Jeremy Corbyn played to his strengths - and played to the crowds - at leadership rallies. Momentum managed an impressive social media campaign. Pop acts and Corbynistas rubbed shoulders at Labour Live And he was re-elected with a higher share of the vote. A victory for Jeremy Corbyn but also for Momentum. Jon Lansman was delighted: ""We raised a great deal of money. We only had two or three thousand members before the coup. We came out of it with 20,000. We now have more than double that."" But a former Labour leader, Lord Kinnock - who had started out on the Left - felt too much time had been spent by Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters on changing his party rather than looking outwards to change the country. ""I would say that Jeremy, and I doubt that he would disagree with this, comes from a segment in British politics, in Labour politics that has always existed, and is largely composed of people who give a higher priority to power in the Labour Party than power for the Labour Party. ""And if they're ideologues it means that they have a convenient life because it means they only have to make a decision once in their life. ""You can't drive a car or bring up a family like that. I don't think it is the reality of life."" But even after Corbyn's second leadership election, elements of the party machine - including crucially the national executive - weren't fully in his hands. That came later - after the 2017 general election. Although some seats were won by Labour MPs who publicly distanced themselves from Corbyn's leadership, the massive increase in the share of the vote led to the abandonment of two putative leadership challenges and from this point on, many of his internal opponents kept their heads down and their tongues bitten. John Stolliday says there was an active debate about broadening the political base of the shadow cabinet, but it didn't happen: ""There was an opportunity straight after the 2017 election for Jeremy Corbyn to look at the issues facing this country and to say 'I need the full range of talents of this party and that includes the senior and serious figures, the former ministers, who are on the backbenches now'. ""Jeremy had an opportunity to put these people in to his shadow cabinet and to say 'this is a united, unified party'. ""Unfortunately he chose to reject that - and decided to instead reward loyalists and loyalty."" Indeed Jeremy Corby's supporters tightened rather than relaxed their grip following the election. Behind-the-scenes changes were resisted in a token fashion at best. As a senior figure in the parliamentary party confided off the record: ""The lunatics have taken over the asylum, it's just a game of survival for most of us - we are ploughing our own furrows and waiting for the madness to pass."" To reflect the much-expanded membership, three new seats were added to Labour's national executive, or NEC - and all three of these new positions were taken by members of Momentum, including its founder Jon Landsman. John Stolliday explained the importance of Labour's NEC: ""In the Labour Party, control of the NEC means that you control every decision that happens internally. ""So, whether it's picking the longlist or shortlist for a by-election to see which candidate is going to be selected, whether it's deciding the party's priorities, the rule changes that will happen at conference, every decision is made by the NEC - control of the NEC is absolutely vital."" Another less well-known body has also had a change of management. The former GMTV political editor and MP Gloria De Piero and the former Eastender and Labour peer Michael Cashman - seen as supporters of New Labour - were outvoted as members of the Conference Arrangements Committee by the left-wing former trade union leader Billy Hayes and a community worker and constituency activist from Tottenham in north London, Seema Chandwani. The committee influences what is discussed and when at Labour's annual gathering. Seema Chandwani is a member of Momentum and a left-wing group with a longer pedigree  - the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. She saw this as a victory for democracy after many years in which, she believes, the Left had been kept well away from the reins of power, as well as a consequence of the expanded - and younger - membership. ""These weren't random Martians coming from Planet Momentum. These were people who are active in our communities. ""It struck a modicum of fear in some of the current members who were saying 'oh, we are going back to the eighties'. ""But I said, what happened in the eighties? I was four in the eighties."" So important parts of Labour's machinery are now operated from the Left. But not everything has changed. Swathes of the Parliamentary Labour Party - while cowed  - remain sceptical of Corbyn's leadership. One senior figure told me ""the Corbyn phase will be over - when we lose the next election"". He believes we have seen ""peak Corbyn"". But as the 2017 result proved, the political future can be difficult to predict. And there are further changes to the Labour Party being planned in the name of empowering the mass membership. A ""democracy review"" is in full flight. Both Momentum and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are suggesting that the way the party's parliamentary candidates are selected should change, making it easier for party members at local level to trigger contests rather than re-adopting a sitting MP on the nod. This isn't, however, what's often referred to as mandatory reselections - effectively requiring MPs to get the backing of members in every parliament. The Left hasn't exactly been overwhelmingly successful at getting its candidates selected under the current system. The new MP for Lewisham East - elected this month - was not backed by Momentum or the influential left-wing Unite trade union. Local councillor Janet Daby was supported by groups that would once have been described as Brownite and Blairite - the campaign groups Labour First and Progress - though it's a measure of how the party has moved to the left that Janet Daby is now regarded as a ""moderate"". She voted for Jeremy Corbyn in both leadership contests. Lucy Powell said: ""I don't think you can see Momentum as a homogenous force sweeping the party. They are more effective when they are mobilising people online. ""When it comes to local selections they have been much less effective because usually what people go for tend to go for a good strong committed local person. ""Trying to parachute in a Momentum or Unite-favoured candidate doesn't work."" New Lewisham East MP Janet Daby was not the preferred choice of Momentum or Unite For Jon Lansman, though, time and effort will deliver. Perspiration is as important as inspiration for him: ""The party is a fundamentally different party and is committed to radical change. ""The effect of having so many new members will eventually flow through. It hasn't got there yet. ""Local government is hardly touched by the new membership, with the exception of one or two authorities. ""We're still in the early days of trickling through the system. ""For local government and then for Parliament - because you select a proportion of candidates every time - that will flow through. ""I don't think there is any going back."" Momentum is running training sessions for new councillors, who in turn may become MPs. But even if the make-up of the Parliamentary Labour Party doesn't change dramatically in the short term, its power is set to diminish further. In 2015, candidates for the party leadership needed to demonstrate support from 15% of MPs and MEPs. This was reduced to 10% at last year's Labour conference. And now the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy wants the ability to shut out politicians from this process entirely. They are suggesting - when the time comes and Corbyn goes - that any candidate who wants to replace him would simply need to have the support of 10% of constituencies, or 10% of affiliated trade unions to avoid the need to have the backing of one in 10 of the parliamentary party. Seema Chandwani explained the thinking: ""You have got these shortlisting gatekeepers called MPs who have been elected to have that role. ""From the perspective of the lay-member, should there really be any type of gate-keeping to get on the ballot paper? ""The leader of the Labour Party is there not as the property of the MPs, they are the property of the whole party."" I asked her if these rule changes were more likely to result in a successor to Jeremy Corbyn who was just as left wing. She responded: ""It would be more likely that his successor is somebody members want. And if somebody they want is more Left, then that's democracy."" Jeremy Corbyn called his 2017 general election manifesto the star of the campaign and it's clear that Labour would tax more and spend more - those earning more than Â£80,000 and big corporations would pay more tax, and some services in private hands - such as the water industry in England and Wales - would be returned to the public sector. Many of the newer members in particular are delighted to see clear red water separating the opposition from the government. But there are fears that the enthusiasm of a mass membership could turn to disappointment - disillusion even - if the party doesn't deliver quickly enough on the pledges that Jeremy Corbyn recites at party rallies. One council that is already in the Momentum mould is Salford in Greater Manchester. Its mayor Paul Dennett is a strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. He shares his leader's passion for housing - and council housing in particular. The local authority has set up a housing company that embodies radicalism in its name. It's called Derive. But it's pronounced Dereeve. Salford in Greater Manchester, where the council has set up its own housing company The name was derived (not dereeved) from Guy Debord, a member of the Paris-based Marxist Situationist collective, the Lettrist International - which, naturally enough, split from the Letterists - in the Fifties. It's all about designing urban environments around emotion and human behaviour. But looking at the company's construction plans in the mayor's office, the housing probably owes a bit more to Brookside than Bauhaus. The development that's getting under way is a mix of housing for rent, shared ownership and home for sale. This is hardly a return to the days when the ultra-left Militant Tendency (or Revolutionary Socialist League) controlled Liverpool Council, culminating - as then Labour leader Neil Kinnock put it in 1985 - ""in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council - a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"". Dennett, a Momentum member, has coined a term for his rather different approach: ""It's what I would refer to as sensible socialism. It's a pragmatic response to the context in which we find ourselves. ""That isn't to say we're not trying to change the system."" With eight- yes, eight - new rented homes in the pipeline he knows he is making only a modest start but believes when a Labour government ends austerity, it will be possible to play his part fully in delivering the party's million homes pledge. For now he is giving a glimpse of the possible - erecting a signpost to a future direction. But he also has to work hard to manage the expectations of party members. ""This is a continual challenge,"" he says. ""I regularly attend branch meetings and we have got party members who see the manifesto and want me to implement it as quickly as I possibly can. ""It's been interesting to go through some of the policy and resource complexity with party members and in terms of their expectations around delivery they become more realistic."" If this is a challenge locally, the shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne - also Labour's joint election co-ordinator - knows it could be a nightmare nationally. ""What gives me sleepless nights is that so many of the big ticket promises in Labour's manifesto will be down to local government to deliver,"" he tells me. ""The worry for me is the ability and capacity of local councils to be able to deliver."" Behind the scenes in Whitehall, Labour has been preparing for government - with each shadow departmental team being given advice by the former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake. Andrew Gwynne believes the party needs a clearer plan, and to be honest about which parts of Labour's manifesto can't be delivered swiftly if hope isn't to be eclipsed by disappointment. ""It's going to take time to overcome eight years or more of Tory austerity. It is going to take time to build up capacity in central government, it is going to take time to build up capacity in local government and we've got to ensure that we have that right mix of offering hope and optimism and people being able to see change, but also not disappointing that change hasn't been quick enough or radical enough."" He also warns of the dangers if Labour fails to reconcile aspirations with the art of the possible. ""If we come to power on the back of massive optimism, a new way of doing things, and we fall at the first hurdle then it will be very difficult to recover."" Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock says the party has to ""compromise"" with the electorate Lord Kinnock - as Neil Kinnock - began as a protÃ©gÃ© of left-wing Labour leader Michael Foot in the 1980s. But as he moved to the centre, the party picked up support. He is urging the current leadership to ""compromise"" further with the electorate if its 40% at the last election is to be a building block not a ceiling. He thinks this may mean that party membership falls a bit, with some people drifting off to protest groups, but the prize would be wider support. ""There has to be compromise with the electorate. And if the electorate isn't supporting you - you can't invent another one. ""You have to deal with the people that exist, that have needs and hopes, and serve those needs and hopes in a way they can comprehend and can embrace."" There have also been unanticipated consequences of a mass membership. Sometimes in politics arguments emerge over means rather than ends. The leadership of both the country's biggest union, Unite, and Momentum wanted to see Labour move to the Left, and to keep Jeremy Corbyn at the helm. But there are differences over personnel - and how to preserve the leader's legacy. For many in Momentum - some of whom haven't risen through the ranks of 'organised labour' - a more democratic party that shifts power to the members is the best way of ensuring Labour remains on the Left. If this or that left-wing union general secretary were to be ousted, they fear the party - or at least its machine - in turn could drift to the the right. For example, the left-wing Unite leader Len McCluskey faced a leadership challenge last year, and then a legal challenge to his victory. Had he been removed the left-wing delegates he in effect appoints to Labour's ruling national executive could also have been replaced. A sign of this tension was when, briefly this spring, Momentum's Jon Lansman declared he would apply for the post of the party's most senior official - the general secretary. In doing so he was defying the party leadership who wanted to install the Unite official Jennie Formby. He later withdrew, telling me he simply wanted to see a ""proper process"". But these tensions have surfaced again recently - in Wales. Labour' s leader in the principality, the first minister Carwyn Jones, has announced he will stand down in the autumn. There is now a battle not so much over who should succeed him, but how his successor should be chosen - though the latter could determine the former. The method of selection is an ""electoral college"" giving unions and elected politicians two thirds of the vote and consigning grassroots members to one third. There will now be a hastily-arranged special conference in September to decide whether these rules should be changed - and those on the left in particular are calling for the power of selection to be in the hands of the rank and file. Darren Williams - a left-wing member both of Labour's ruling national executive and its Welsh executive - insists that changing the leadership rules is about more than faction-fighting. ""Some of the resistance to a one member one vote contest in Wales comes from people who assume that [it] is more likely to favour a left-wing, pro-Corbyn candidate but I think there are arguments just based on which is the more democratic system."" Unite leader Len McCluskey - handing out ice creams at Labour Live - saw off a leadership challenge last year But four big unions are resisting this move. Mike Payne, of the GMB union in Wales, is warning that weakening the union voice in a leadership contest could have unintended consequences: ""The trade unions have always been the consistent body within the party that keeps it stable. ""If you take away the voice of organised labour then the party becomes a mile away  from working people on a day to day basis and becomes remote.' The UK leader is already chosen by the members but John Stolliday expects similar underlying tensions to become more apparent: ""There is a fundamental conflict Labour has to face in the next year or so. ""Whether it is a party of the membership or of the trade unions and those who created it. It's almost an existential problem. ""There is a delicate balance... it becomes more of a tyranny of the majority if one side gets to rule the roost."" Seema Chandwani has a foot in both camps - an activist in her constituency and with her union, Unite, She says: ""Who is in charge of the party - members or the affiliated organisations? That's been there pre-Corbyn and there is always going to be that tension of how do people maintain and use power. ""I am not going to tell you there isn't going to be that tension or it's all going to be lovely."" And the leadership is challenged when the mass membership aren't quite in step with them. The Labour Live event this month wasn't a sell-out, politically or in terms of tickets. There were a few exceptions, but it was overwhelmingly attended by staunch supporters - admirers, even - of Jeremy Corbyn. But many also sported fluorescent stickers opposing, with rather colourful language, Brexit. Some Labour Live attendees voiced their displeasure at Labour's approach to Brexit A survey of party members carried out by Queen Mary University and YouGov suggested more than eight in 10 members supported staying in the single market - something Jeremy Corbyn hasn't, and possibly won't, endorse. Some of those wearing the stickers said they were simply expressing ""disappointment"" at Brexit, and not at the position of the party leadership. But Brexit is an issue which cuts across left/right lines - with even some grassroots members of Momentum calling for a new referendum. Jon Lansman explains the difficulty: ""It's very difficult to navigate - to win elections we need to take people with us with a range of views on Brexit. ""So far Jeremy has done that extremely well. It may get more difficult."" Whatever the tensions over specific issues - proof, John McDonnell would contend, that the party leadership doesn't suppress what he calls ""robust debate"" - those on the left would argue that the political ground is shifting and that the membership are united by their radicalism. Time and again, leading Labour figures including Jeremy Corbyn use the word ""transformation"". They don't just want to change this or that tax rate, they really do want to change society. Many would buy into a concept popularised - if that's the word - by the Italian politician and Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who developed his thinking in the 1930s when he was imprisoned by Mussolini's regime. He argued that the ruling class exercised ""cultural hegemony"" - in effect that they imbued society with their assumptions, which became the received wisdom. So it wasn't surprising Labour Live was billed as a cultural as well as a political festival. Labour's leadership believe they have overturned what they term ""the neo-liberal consensus"" and have challenged the efficacy and morality of austerity. Jon Lansman believes that if a left-wing government does take power - despite all the constraints set out by Andrew Gwynne - vested interests will resist. And it's at this point Momentum will prove its true worth, he says. ""We want to make a significant transformation. We want decisions which affect jobs and livelihoods democratised. The global corporations will resist. Other governments have faced challenges like runs on the pound. And we may face similar things. I hope we don't. ""The people who are opposed to doing what we want to do have one thing in their favour - money. We have people. ""We need the power of people to overcome the power of money."" Of course, it's possible Jeremy Corbyn won't make it to Downing Street - that the clash of people and corporations just doesn't happen. But the party he presides over has already changed. And those around him are unsurprisingly confident that some of the changes that have been wrought in the past few years are likely to be permanent. It was a relaxed shadow chancellor I encountered at Labour Live. John McDonnell was in open-necked shirt, stopping to chat with journalists and supporters. He told me that even if he and Jeremy Corbyn were to depart the scene Labour would remain an anti-austerity party - and ""there will be no triangulation"", where the main parties compete on similar territory. ""That has gone now,"" he tells me. His close political ally Jon Lansman is confident, too, there is no going back to the politics of the Blair/Brown era. ""The party has fundamentally changed,"" he says. ""We're not going to go back to neo-liberalism, we're not going back to privatising the health service. That's decided forever. Well, for a generation or two."" But a measure of how the party has changed is that many of those who didn't back Jeremy Corbyn for leader are recognising this too. John Stolliday - who joined Labour's head office under Tony Blair - believes the current leader has a stronger grip on the levers of power than New Labour's founder and frontman. This video can not be played Momentum supporter Owen Jones and Progress director Richard Angell on Labour candidate selection He said: ""Blair controlled the party through the popular weight of his determination to get into power, and people were willing because he won power so overwhelmingly in 1997. ""Jeremy has uniquely managed to get hold of not just the membership of the party, but also of the NEC and the party structures. ""No leader has ever controlled all the levers of power at the Labour Party before."" And Lucy Powell - Ed Miliband's former chief of staff who subsequently worked on Andy Burnham's failed leadership bid - agreed. ""Jeremy can be the leader for as long as he wants to be. No-one is going to challenge that at all. We just need  to get on with the job we're all elected to do."" But, she adds, ""with power comes responsibility"". Others at grassroots level, groups that were more comfortable with the pre-Corbyn era - Progress and Labour First - continue to try to combat control by the Left. Their members are not Marxists. They don't believe anything is historically inevitable. The Long March of Corbyn's Labour hasn't yet reached its destination.

"This video can not be played Cable: Reports of my imminent departure are wide of the mark Sir Vince Cable will stand down as Lib Dem leader ""once Brexit is resolved or stopped""- and wants non-party members to vote for his replacement. In a speech, Sir Vince set out plans to transform the party into a ""movement for moderates"". Party sources say he wants to see this delivered while he is still leader and wants to stay in his job for crucial Brexit developments. He also wants to continue campaigning for a second EU referendum. ""He has a set of objectives rather than a timeline,"" a senior Lib Dem source said. Gina Miller rules out Lib Dem leadership bid Sir Vince Cable 'made mistake' in missing Brexit vote The Lib Dems have 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives and remains in single figures in the opinion polls. Sir Vince has predicted a realignment of British politics, as Labour and the Conservatives split over Brexit and it is thought he wants to ensure the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second EU referendum, are well placed to work with any new ""centre ground"" groups. The former business secretary told an audience in Westminster: ""I think we have to recognise that despite our best efforts, the Liberal Democrats might not be the only centre force in British politics. ""I think it is the worst kept secret in Westminster that political disquiet in the two major parties, is provoking some people to consider a new party of the centre ground, or several. And I think this requires us to demand better than the usual tribalism, whether that is our own or others."" Sir Vince added: ""Liberal democracy itself is under threat notably in the USA, in eastern Europe and perhaps here. Authoritarians and extremists of both right and left are on the march."" This video can not be played The Vince Cable story Analysis by Chief Political Correspondent Vicki Young Some Conservative and many more Labour MPs feel increasingly ill-at-ease with the direction their party is going in. There have been conversations over summer barbecues about creating a new party, or breaking away from the old ones but there's certainly no agreement about what happens next. Tony Blair and Sir Vince Cable share the belief that there are millions of voters on what they call the centre ground who feel homeless. Sir Vince is offering to put a roof over their heads - but it's hard to imagine dozens of Labour MPs sidling over to the Liberal Democrats. The tribal nature of British politics is deeply ingrained. Sir Vince's answer is to open up his party to outsiders in an attempt to attract a broader range of support and maybe a different pool of political talent. He seems to be saying to those who share his liberal values and his anti-Brexit stance, that he can supply the vehicle for their journey. But without an obvious figurehead, it's hard to see how these disparate voices can become more than a crowd of disillusioned politicians, grumbling about the status quo. The Twickenham MP said he wanted to transform the Liberal Democrats from what he called ""an old-style political party"" into a ""movement for moderates"" and had held discussions with some unnamed Labour and Conservative MPs. He advocated a change to the party's rules, so someone who was not an MP could be leader, and ""liberal minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership. He said he did not want to follow in the footsteps of Liberal prime minister William Gladstone, who served into his 80s - or fellow octogenarian leader Robert Mugabe but added: ""Reports I have read of my imminent departure are very wide of the mark. ""Now is not the time for an internal election, there is serious work for me and the party to do. ""Once Brexit is resolved or stopped, that will be the time to conduct a leadership election under the new rules."" His proposed changes would have to be approved by party members and will be discussed at their conference in Brighton later this month. Sir Vince took over as leader in July 2017 without a contest following the resignation of Tim Farron. The Liberal Democrats had 99,200 membersas of August 2018,external. The Labour Partychanged its membership rules under Ed Milibandfrom an electoral college system in which union members, MPs and party members had one-third of the vote each to a ""one member one vote"" system, which allowed ""registered supporters"" to take part for a Â£3 fee. Labour's membership swelled in 2015 and it is thought to have had about 540,000 members as of April 2018, up from around 190,000 in 2014. But there were claims that the new rules were fuelling ""entryism"" - allowing other groups to infiltrate the party in an effort to promote their own agenda. It is thought that Sir Vince plans to rewrite the rules so that supporters need to be enrolled for 12 months before voting, to prevent infiltration by rival parties.

"Leyla Hussein spoke about her efforts to tackle FGM as the proclamation was signed British schoolgirls have been pressured by their fellow students into having female genital mutilation, a campaigner against the practice has said. Leyla Hussein said girls are vulnerable as some see it as a cultural practice despite it being a crime in the UK. Her warning came as British and US agencies signed an agreement to step up co-operation in tackling FGM. A police commander said intelligence has to date been ""woeful"" and the lack of a UK conviction was unacceptable. Commander Ivan Balhatchet from the National Police Chiefs' Council is appealing to the public, support groups and those who work with children to pass information to police. 'This is what it's like to pee after FGM' The girl who convinced the Maasai to stop FGM The proclamation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Atlantic - including the NPCC, the Metropolitan Police, Border Force, the FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security - pledges to better share intelligence and best practice on identifying victims and prosecuting perpetrators. Police, prosecutors and border officials on both sides of the Atlantic are pledging better intelligence sharing It is hoped the new agreement will improve existing operations at airports including London Heathrow and JFK in New York and help spot victims as they are taken to parts of the world to be cut, such as North Africa and the Middle East. Dr Hussein, a psychotherapist who had FGM in Somaliawhen she was aged seven, is backing the UK and US efforts. She said: ""The pressure is still there... some of my clients are 19-year-old girls now who were children or were born in this [country] and they will say to you they were pressured in a playground in a school in London to go and have it done."" Dr Hussein, who moved to the UK aged 12 but said she did not know FGM was wrong until years later, said ""education plays a big part, in terms of prevention, because I said if I had some information in my school I might have said something"". She founded the north London-based Dahlia Project to raise awareness and support FGM victims. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external NHS figures in England recorded between April 2015 and March 2018 show more than 16,000 women and girls have undergone FGM at some point in their lives. The 6,195 cases recorded between April 2017 and March this year involved 150 people who were born in the UK and 1,715 born in eastern Africa. FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and further legislation in 2003 and 2005 made it an offence to arrange FGM outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents. But there is yet to be a successful prosecution. The government has put increasing efforts into tackling FGM in recent years and it is compulsory for family doctors, hospitals and mental health trusts to report any new cases in their patients.

"The move was seen as a bid to improve dwindling television audiences The organisers of the Oscars have announced they have postponed plans to introduce a new popular film category at their annual awards ceremony. The award, which could have recognised films popular with audiences but not critics, was only announced last month. In a statement, the Academy's CEO said she had ""recognised the need for further discussion"" with its members about the proposal first. It was set to be introduced at the 91st Oscars in February 2019. ""The Academy recognized that implementing any new award nine months into the year creates challenges for films that have already been released,"" it said in statement. Which films could win the new Oscar? Four things to take away from the 2018 awards It also added that its board of governors would continue to discuss the matter, and will ""examine and seek additional input regarding this category"". After its announcement, the category drew praise from the public on social media butreceived a backlash from some in Hollywood. It was widely suggested the move was a bid to improve dwindling television audiences for the event, rather than recognising artistic merit. It was hoped the category could recognise box office hits like Black Panther Viewing figures for the Academy Awards have been falling in recent years -with the 2018 viewing figures 39% down on 2014's,external. In previous years, films which have done well at the box office with audiences - including Mamma Mia, Avatar and the Mission Impossible franchise - have been snubbed by the Academy. The Oscars' organisers did not elaborate in their August announcement how eligibility for the new category would have been established. Some Hollywood critics suggested the new category's ""popular"" tag was confusing and could risk creating a two-tier system among films. It was feared films praised by critics and audiences alike, such as Dunkirk and Get Out, would risk being relegated to the new category rather than standing a chance in the prestigious Best Film award category.

The girl's disappearance is one of Australia's longest-running mysteries. Her accused murderer, 64, is expected to face a trial in May. He cannot be named for legal reasons because he was 16 at the time of the alleged murder. The man was arrested in Melbourne in March last year. On Friday, he appeared via video link in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and entered a plea of not guilty. Cheryl went missing on 12 January, 1970, after a family trip to a beach in Wollongong, a city 70km (44 miles) south of Sydney. It sparked a massive search at the time, but no trace of the girl was ever found. Cheryl disappeared from Fairy Meadow Surf Club in Wollongong in 1970 Police said in 2016 that they had uncovered fresh information.

"Trainee teacher Rhiannon Smith was killed in a car crash - nobody was charged for what was seen as a tragic accident The father of a woman killed in a car crash said he would ""find it hard to live with"" himself if he was involved in a similar fatal incident. Julian Smith said the loss of Rhiannon, 21, has changed his attitude to driving and he wants action to cut road deaths. Trainee teacherMiss Smith was killed as she tried to turn onto the A48near Llandevaud in Newport. The Welsh Government said while progress to reduce deaths had been made, there was work to be done. ""What has happened to me over the past 18 months has been devastating,"" Mr Smith toldBBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales. His grief has led to him totally changing the way he approaches driving because he said would find it hard ""to live with"" or ""justify"" being responsible for another family experiencing a similar loss. In 2017, police forces in Wales recorded 4,556 road accidents involving personal injury, 7.4% fewer than in 2016. Over the same period, 103 people were killed on Welsh roads - the same as in 2016 - while 961 people were seriously injured, a reduction of 43. Rhiannon's parents have described how ""disturbing"" it has been losing their daughter in this way Mr Smith described having a ""much wider perception of the dangers"" and a more conservative approach now. This includes never using a mobile phone in his car, never going over the speed limit and always giving himself plenty of time to arrive at a destination. He said that like with rail and air, there should be a system in place to review and learn from road crashes to help stop further accidents. Miss Smith, a Cardiff University graduate was finishing her PGCE at the University of Gloucestershire and had applied for a job as a teacher in London when she was killed. The incident in March 2017, happened when she had to drive around a car parked on the side of the road and join the A48, which has a 50mph (80kmh) speed limit. There were no charges for what was seen as a tragic accident and while Newport council has stopped cars parking in the area, Mr Smith wants the speed limit cut. Special police team 'could cut crashes' Call for Â£200m 'high risk' road spending Driving home? 10 things to know about roads Alongside his wife Gill, he will host a special road safety conference in Newport on Friday, calling for greater measures to prevent further fatalities. ""With my daughter's collision it was the realisation of the numbers that die on the roads and to encourage local and national government to recognise their obligations,"" Mr Smith added. ""In the past there has been talk of hitting zero deaths, but very little talk recently whatsoever."" Julian Smith said young people in particular may not realise the impact of dangerous driving More speed reduction schemes, further safety tests and the creation of a specialist collision investigation team,which Newport East MP Jessica Morden previously raised in parliament, will be called for at the conference later. A Welsh Government spokesman said it had had targets in place since 2013, when the Road Safety Framework for Wales was published. ""In 2017 we made good progress towards the targets for an overall reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) (24.3% reduction on the 2004-08 baseline) and in the numbers of young people KSI (40.7% reduction on the 2004-08 baseline),"" he said. ""There is more work to be done and we will continue to encourage road safety schemes across Wales."" This video can not be played ""So much more can be done"" to stop fatal car crashes According to a report by theEuropean Commission,external, Sweden and the UK have the safest roads in Europe.

"The move was seen as a bid to improve dwindling television audiences The organisers of the Oscars have announced they have postponed plans to introduce a new popular film category at their annual awards ceremony. The award, which could have recognised films popular with audiences but not critics, was only announced last month. In a statement, the Academy's CEO said she had ""recognised the need for further discussion"" with its members about the proposal first. It was set to be introduced at the 91st Oscars in February 2019. ""The Academy recognized that implementing any new award nine months into the year creates challenges for films that have already been released,"" it said in statement. Which films could win the new Oscar? Four things to take away from the 2018 awards It also added that its board of governors would continue to discuss the matter, and will ""examine and seek additional input regarding this category"". After its announcement, the category drew praise from the public on social media butreceived a backlash from some in Hollywood. It was widely suggested the move was a bid to improve dwindling television audiences for the event, rather than recognising artistic merit. It was hoped the category could recognise box office hits like Black Panther Viewing figures for the Academy Awards have been falling in recent years -with the 2018 viewing figures 39% down on 2014's,external. In previous years, films which have done well at the box office with audiences - including Mamma Mia, Avatar and the Mission Impossible franchise - have been snubbed by the Academy. The Oscars' organisers did not elaborate in their August announcement how eligibility for the new category would have been established. Some Hollywood critics suggested the new category's ""popular"" tag was confusing and could risk creating a two-tier system among films. It was feared films praised by critics and audiences alike, such as Dunkirk and Get Out, would risk being relegated to the new category rather than standing a chance in the prestigious Best Film award category.

"Baskets have become a rare sight at the Asda store in Cambridge Supermarket giant Asda said it has been forced to order dozens of new baskets because of a shortage at a store - caused by customers taking them home. The baskets went missing at the store in Cambridge after the company began phasing out 5p plastic bags. The store only has 30 to 40 left for its customers. An Asda spokesman said the firm asked ""that the small number of customers who are taking our baskets home with them use their bags for life instead"". A new load of 100 plastic green baskets to replace those that have gone missing is set to arrive at the store at the Beehive Centre next week. A 5p charge on the thin, single-use plastic bags was introduced in 2015 but Asda pledged in February to end the sale of those bags by the end of this year. Stocks of 5p bags at Asda stores are no longer being replenished when they run out, but larger and sturdier ""bags for life"", costing 9p, are still available. Currently, Cambridge is understood to be the only Asda store with a basket shortage. Asda has urged people to remember their bags for life when shopping at the store Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons have all either phased out the single-use plastic bags or are in the process of doing so. Other retailers have electronic tags on their baskets in some stores as a preventative measure to avoid customers taking them home. Tesco said they were unaware of similar basket problems in any of their stores but one person responded to the BBC on Twitter to claim that there was a ""massive problem"" at his local store: Allow Twitter content?

"British Airways's boss has apologised for what he says was a sophisticated breach of the firm's security systems, and has promised compensation. Alex Cruz told the BBC that hackers carried out a ""sophisticated, malicious criminal attack"" on its website. The airline said personal and financial details of customers making or changing bookings had been compromised. About 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details. ""We are 100% committed to compensate them, period,"" Mr Cruz told the BBC's Today programme. ""We are committed to working with any customer who may have been financially affected by this attack, and we will compensate them for any financial hardship that they may have suffered."" BA said the breach took place between 22:58 BST on 21 August and 21:45 BST on 5 September.  Shares in BA parent group IAG closed 1.4% lower on Friday. Mr Cruz also told the Today programme: ""We're extremely sorry. I know that it is causing concern to some of our customers, particularly those customers that made transactions over BA.com and app. ""We discovered that something had happened but we didn't know what it was [on Wednesday evening]. So overnight, teams were trying to figure out the extent of the attack. This video can not be played British Airways' chairman and CEO says affected customers will be 100% compensated ""The first thing was to find out if it was something serious and who it affected or not. The moment that actual customer data had been compromised, that's when we began immediate communication to our customers."" BA said all customers affected by the breach had been contacted on Thursday night.  The breach only affects people who bought tickets during the timeframe provided by BA, and not on other occasions. Mr Cruz added: ""At the moment, our number one purpose is contacting those customers that made those transactions to make sure they contact their credit card bank providers so they can follow their instructions on how to manage that breach of data."" The airline has taken out adverts apologising for the breach in Friday's newspapers. By Simon Read, business reporter What data was stolen? ""It was name, email address, credit card information - that would be credit card number, expiration date and the three digit [CVV] code on the back of the credit card,"" said BA boss Mr Cruz. BA insists it did not store the CVV numbers.  This is prohibited under international standards set out by the PCI Security Standards Council. Since BA said the attackers also managed to obtain CVV numbers, security researchers have speculated that the card details were intercepted, rather than harvested from a BA database. How did hackers get in? It isn't totally clear how hackers boarded BA's website and app - but cyber-security experts have some suggestions. How did hackers get into British Airways? What could the hackers do with the data? Once fraudsters have your personal information, they may be able to access your bank account, or open new accounts in your name, or use your details to make fraudulent purchases. They could also sell on your details to other crooks. What do I need to do? If you've been affected, you should change your online passwords. Then monitor your bank and credit card accounts keeping an eye out for any dodgy transactions. Also be very wary of any emails or calls asking for more information to help deal with the data breach: crooks often pose as police, banks or, in this instance they could pretend to be from BA. Will my booking be affected? BA says none of the bookings have been hit by the breach.  It said it has contacted all those affected to alert them to the problem with their data, but booked flights should go ahead. Will there be compensation for me? If you suffer any financial loss or hardship, the airline has promised to compensate you. Jorg Herrera, from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, received an email from BA last night having booked tickets with the airline last month. ""I have six cards linked to my BA account,"" he told the BBC. ""I have no idea how much of my information has been stolen. ""I will have to go to each of my credit card providers, cancel the cards, and all the direct debits, etc, related to those cards. This will take a long time, something I have to do with no help from BA. ""This whole thing is terribly concerning and really annoying."" BA could potentially face fines from the Information Commissioner's Office, which is looking into the breach. Rachel Aldighieri, managing director of the Direct Marketing Association, said: ""British Airways has a duty to ensure their customer data is always secure. They need to show that they have done everything possible to ensure such a breach won't happen again. ""The risks go far beyond the fines regulators can issue - albeit that these could be hefty under the new [EU data protection] GDPR regime."" Under GDPR, fines can be up to 4% of annual global revenue. BA's total revenue in the year to 31 December 2017 was Â£12.226bn, so that could be a potential maximum of Â£489m. The National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre also confirmed they were assessing the incident. This is not the first customer relations problem to affect the airline in recent times. In July, BA apologised afterIT issues caused dozens of flights in and out of Heathrow Airport to be cancelled. The month before,more than 2,000 BA passengers had their tickets cancelledbecause the prices were too cheap. And in May 2017, problems with BA's IT systems led to thousands of passengers having their plans disrupted, afterall flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were cancelled. ""It does not indicate that the information systems are the most robust in the airline industry,"" Simon Calder, travel editor at the Independent, told the BBC. However, he does not think BA will be affected in the long term by the breach. ""The airline has immense strength. Notably it's holding a majority of slots at Heathrow, and an enviable safety record, so while this is embarrassing and will potentially cost tens of millions of pounds to resolve, it's more like another flesh wound for BA, rather than anything serious.""

"This video can not be played Britain's representative Karen Pierce and her Russian counterpart Vasily Nebenzya both addressed the UN Russia's threat to the international community is ""real"" and ""active"", the head of GCHQ has warned. Jeremy Fleming's comments came after theUS, France, Germany and Canada agreed with the UKthat Russia was behind the Salisbury Novichok attack. In a speech in Washington, Mr Fleming said Russia's desire to ""undermine"" international law was ""brazen"". At a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". Mr Fleming, the director of the government's cyber intelligence agency, said GCHQ had supported police in a ""painstaking"" and ""highly complex"" investigation into what happened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Wiltshire on 4 March. The UKnamed two men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. The Kremlin called the accusations ""unacceptable"". But Mr Fleming said: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active."" He added: ""And it will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies. Able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus."" Russian spy: What we know so far Russia's scorn for 'cheap soap opera' Could suspects be returned to the UK? What happened to the Skripals? Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Britain's ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, said she was ""really disappointed"" that Russia was refusing to engage or acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. She added that Russia ""often only has a negative agenda"" with regards to international affairs. This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? A statement from Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau and Theresa May said on Thursday: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reiterate our outrage at the use of a chemical nerve agent, known as Novichok, in Salisbury on March 4."" The leaders welcomed progress in the investigation, but urged those with more information to contact the UK authorities. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU,"" the statement added. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries in response to the 4 March attack, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". The leaders said the link to the GRU - revealed on Wednesday - would strengthen their intention to work together against foreign spy networks, the use of chemical weapons, and to ""defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies"". BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg said Russia was ""viewed increasingly as a rogue nation"" by the West, adding that status would ""grate"" with the Kremlin. The UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, alongside China and UK allies the US and France, met in New York to discuss the latest progress in the investigation. Addressing the council, Ms Pierce, said the nerve agent attack was a ""direct challenge"" to the ""rules-based international system that has kept all of us safe since 1945"". In a lengthy rebuttal, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and UK citizens. ""We have lost all hope in finding the truth,"" he said, adding that the latest developments were ""invented out of thin air"". He highlighted a number of so-called ""inconsistencies"", which he said were ""off the charts"", in the UK's evidence. Mrs May told the Commons on Wednesday that the two suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports. The prime minister told MPs the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. Prosecutors in the UK believe there is sufficient evidence to charge the pair with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act. Russia does not extradite its nationals, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the men travel to the EU. Police released CCTV showing the two men arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March On Friday, Wiltshire Council confirmed decontamination work had begun at Mr Skripal's home in Salisbury, where the nerve agent is thought to have been deployed. The council said the work would be carried out by specialist military teams, possibly supported by specialist contractors. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, werepoisoned with Novichokon 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in nearby Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess and harmed her friend Charlie Rowley.

"Young Brazilians, including former feminist activist Sara Winter, are embracing right-wing politics Sara Winter has always had strong views. As an activist, she used to chain herself to fences in protest at chauvinism and sexual violence. She was, by her own admission, one of the most high-profile feminists in Brazil. Sara is certainly striking. She has peroxide blonde hair, tattoos and a snappy dress sense. But the thing that stands out the most is the badge she is wearing on her top. It is a picture of a skull with a knife through it and two guns. ""It's my favourite police organisation, Bope,"" she says, proudly referring to the logo of Brazil's Special Police Operations Battalion. ""They climb into the favelas and kill the bad guys. They put their lives at risk all the time to save the population of Rio."" It is not the sort of comment you would expect from a liberal activist. But Sara has had a political about-turn in recent years. Six years after having an abortion, Sara became pregnant again. Between the two pregnancies, she had regained her faith in the Catholic Church and her views on pregnancy - and politics - changed radically. ""I was so happy because I felt that God was giving me a second chance to be a mum,"" she recalls. ""I decided to come back to the Church and I think I can help women much more with conservative politics than feminism. ""[I spent] five years being the most popular feminist in Brazil and I did nothing for women,"" she says.  ""I just spent this time talking about abortion and legalising drugs and communism and I called that empowering myself."" Ex-President Lula da Silva has been convicted of corruption and faces 12 years in prison Sara's U-turn is unusual but it mirrors to some extent what is happening in Brazil. For more than 15 years, Brazil was governed by the left. Former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva rose to power in 2003 promising change. But with the country's most loved politician now facing 12 years in prison for corruption,and with his successor Dilma Rousseff impeached, people are disillusioned. The left did not deliver, so people want change. Sara's political idol is the far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. Jair Bolsonaro is currently second in the polls Many refer to Mr Bolsonaro as the ""Brazilian Trump"", the two are very different men in very different countries but the similarities, or rather the set of circumstances that allow them to both exist, are uncanny. Mr Bolsonaro brands himself as different from all the rest, a clean candidate amid a sea of corrupt politicians that has been the talk of Brazil for the past few years. He has been accused of being homophobic and told a congresswoman she was not worth raping. He has ranted against minorities and has called for looser gun laws. Jair Bolsonaro does not hold back. But Sara will not have a bad word said against him. ""I know it sounds really awkward, but really, if any woman could see Bolsonaro's policies, she would be in love, like me!"" She gushingly talks about one of his proposals - chemically castrating rapists. ""We have so many feminist congresswomen, why didn't they suggest this before?"" she asks. ""Bolsonaro did it."" While many people wince at Jair Bolsonaro's politics, he remains a popular figure. He is currently second in the presidential polls after former President Lula, who may not even be able to run now because of his corruption conviction. While Mr Bolsonaro is at the extreme end of the right, conservative politics more generally are enjoying a comeback in Brazil - this in a country that until 1985 was ruled by a military dictatorship. Right-wing pressure groups like the Free Brazil Movement, or MBL in Portuguese, are finding big audiences. The Free Brazil Movement (MBL) emerged out of mass anti-corruption protests in 2016 The MBL started its life on the streets, calling for then President Dilma Rousseff to be impeached. It has since strengthened by going online. It has more than 2.5 million followers on Facebook who avidly watch their political videos criticising Brazil's left-wing politicians. The MBL calls itself libertarian. It wants a freer country with a smaller state, its way. But its politics are hard to define because most members also hold conservative views on abortion and gun ownership. ""The problem is that some parts of Brazilian mentality, especially the left-wing mentality, say that the Conservatives are always totalitarians, always on the wrong side of things,"" says Pedro Ferreira, an MBL co-founder. ""Whenever they try to voice what they feel they are called fascists or Nazis."" He says the internet has changed things. It has allowed people to find their own voice, to find their values. ""That is why we have Trump, that is why we have Brexit, that is why we have MBL. We have the common people's voice being heard,"" he says. There is widespread discontent with politics in Brazil following high-level corruption protests ""That is scaring a lot of people but that is very democratic."" Experts say Brazil's corruption scandals have been fertile ground for this kind of politics. ""You have a total mistrust of every kind of authority in Brazil, so for these movements that propagate hell, that show that everything is wrong, this kind of scenario is very useful,"" says Prof Rafael Alcadipani. ""They pick up very small things in reality and try to magnify them as if these were the biggest problems in Brazil."" Prof Alcadipani accuses movements like the MBL of propagating fake news. But it is an accusation the right makes against the left, too. While the MBL essentially remains a movement, some of its members have entered politics on other parties' tickets. Twenty-one-year-old Fernando Holiday may be one of the MBL's leading figures but he ran for and won a seat as city councillor in SÃ£o Paulo for the Democrats party. Fernando Holiday, 21, says that the MBL is reshaping views on the right in Brazil An unusual poster boy for conservatism, he comes from a poor family and is gay. He thinks young Brazilians had, until recently, become disengaged with politics. ""The right became synonymous with more conservative politics, irrelevant for minorities,"" he says. ""It also became associated with authoritarian, even nostalgic feelings about the dictatorship, like Bolsonaro."" ""But I think we bring a wider vision of what the right is,"" he explains. ""Not everything fits into a standard box and is determined by rigid rules.""

"Left-wing leaders from Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina were once a force to reckon with It does not seem long ago that analysts were predicting a new chapter in Latin America. At the start of the 21st Century, the region's politics were entering a new dawn. For many the change was invigorating: a new socialist era in a region long-known for its gaping inequalities. The poster boys of these new politics were Venezuela's Hugo ChÃ¡vez and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. And across Latin America, from Bolivia to Ecuador and Argentina, the left won out. Fast-forward nearly two decades and Lula, who once was Brazil's most popular politician, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for crimes connected to Operation Car Wash, the largest corruption investigation in the country's history. Lula wants to run in the election in October but it is not clear whether he will be allowed to Hugo ChÃ¡vez's successor, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, has run Venezuela into the ground. People are going hungry and more than four in five people in a country with vast oil reserves are living in poverty.

Read more: Argentina: End of the Kirchner era Profile of SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era And in Costa Rica earlier this month,an evangelical preacher won the first round of the presidential electionand currently maintains the lead ahead of a second round in April. Change is afoot. This year, six presidential elections are taking place in the region. 1 April:Costa Rica second round 22 April:Paraguay & Venezuela 27 May:Colombia first round 17 June:Colombia run-off (if required) 1 July:Mexico 7 October:Brazil first round 28 October:Brazil run-off (if required) Two thirds of the region's more than 600 million inhabitants will have new leader this year and those elected could profoundly change the way Latin America looks and acts. So are we seeing a marked swing from the left to the right? It is not that simple. ""I think it is very difficult to identify a clear narrative,"" says Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of International Relations at the GetÃºlio Vargas Foundation in SÃ£o Paulo. ""Basically the entire political situation in most countries is in flux with the tendency that established parties will not be able to hold onto power and new parties will come in."" There are however several things that unify the region. A decade or so ago, Latin America was riding high on a commodities boom. Soybeans are one of Brazil's top exports That meant that countries like Venezuela, with its vast oil reserves, and Brazil, with its commodities such as soy, sugar, coffee and orange juice, could afford to support its generous social programmes. The region grew on average around 6% between 2003 and 2008, helping to lift millions of people out of poverty. It is a different era now. Economic growth has slowed right down. ""Between 70 and 80 million people moved from poverty to the middle class,"" says Daniel Zovatto, the Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. ""But it's a very precarious middle class that risks returning to poverty."" With dissatisfaction rising, political allegiances are changing. Corruption is the buzzword of Latin American politics. People have taken to the streets in protests against corruption in countries from the Dominican Republic to Brazil According to Transparency International,more than half of people in the region feel their government is doing badly at fighting corruption.,external More than 90 million people said they paid a bribe in 2015. Corruption is not new, but people's attitude to it is changing. Brazil's Car Wash corruption probe can take some responsibility for that. It has implicated not just the country's biggest politicians and business leaders but its tentacles have spread right across the region, from Peru and Panama to Venezuela. The far-reaching web of Brazilian corruption So what is different now? Daniel Zovatto likens it to the recent controversy over sexual violence. ""Sexual harassment isn't new either, but look at the impact now,"" he says. ""There's a change in culture, a change in values,"" he says, adding that with the rise in the middle class, it is not as acceptable as it was before. The way people consume politics in the region is also changing. Latin Americans are some of the biggest users of social media.Brazil has the third-largest numbers of Facebook users in the world,external. ""Social media is making things quite complicated,"" says Oliver Stuenkel. ""A lot of people are becoming more isolated from other mainstream debate. You now have less productive dialogue due to extreme polarization, which is quite worrying because it makes more difficult to establish compromises."" That is especially so in places like Brazil where Lula still has millions of followers despite the corruption charges against him. Lula still commands a loyal following But on the other side of the political divide, there is a growing anti-Lula movement and increasingly powerful right-wing groups are shouting down the left. Politics is polarised and that is being echoed across the region. No more so than in Colombia where President Juan Manuel Santos brokered a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) in 2016 after more than 50 years of conflict. The deal divided Colombians. Who are the Farc? Colombia referendum: Voters reject Farc peace deal But beyond the division over the peace process, one thing unites Colombians and that is anger over corruption. After President Santos had to apologise for illegal funds being funnelled into his campaign, people want change and that will be a big focus of the country's presidential elections in May. People want a new kind of leadership. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro is second in the polls behind Lula ""There is a crisis of representative democracy across the globe. You have to be much more attentive to the different forms in which reality exists,"" says former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. ""You can't put them all together with a simple label. We have to go deeper to understand what's really going on."" In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, an extreme right-wing politician, is polling second behind Lula who may not even be able to run because of his criminal record. A nationalist who supports military intervention in Brazil, Mr Bolsonaro's populist style has drawn a great deal of support from people who feel the country needs strong leadership. The region's second-biggest economy, Mexico, has a populist candidate of its own but AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador could not be more different. While Mr Bolsonaro has been nick-named Brazil's Trump, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador despises the US President and wants to clamp down on crime and corruption. However, both men clearly show the desire in the region for a new kind of politics and a rejection of the political elite. There is a deep distrust of institutions across the region. According to polls carried out by LatinobarÃ³metro, just 53% of people in 2017 thought democracy was the best way of governing. That is the fifth consecutive year it has fallen. Brazilians are the least happy with democracy in the entire region. Just 13% declare themselves satisfied with democracy. What makes people think these elections will change that? Oliver Stuenkel things the dissatisfaction will give rise to more extreme candidates. ""In many countries you have authoritarian candidates saying that the difficulty of democracy is that it takes a long time to make a decision, that it's necessary to concentrate power,"" he says, giving the examples of Bolivia, Venezuela and parts of Central America. Mauricio Fronzaglia, professor of political science at Mackenzie University, agrees. ""Democracy does not deliver what democracy once promised,"" he says. Fernando Henrique Cardoso thinks the problem is more nuanced. ""We have democracy, we're following laws, following the constitution. What is lacking is legitimacy."" And that cannot be solved in an election.

"Leyla Hussein spoke about her efforts to tackle FGM as the proclamation was signed British schoolgirls have been pressured by their fellow students into having female genital mutilation, a campaigner against the practice has said. Leyla Hussein said girls are vulnerable as some see it as a cultural practice despite it being a crime in the UK. Her warning came as British and US agencies signed an agreement to step up co-operation in tackling FGM. A police commander said intelligence has to date been ""woeful"" and the lack of a UK conviction was unacceptable. Commander Ivan Balhatchet from the National Police Chiefs' Council is appealing to the public, support groups and those who work with children to pass information to police. 'This is what it's like to pee after FGM' The girl who convinced the Maasai to stop FGM The proclamation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Atlantic - including the NPCC, the Metropolitan Police, Border Force, the FBI, and the US Department of Homeland Security - pledges to better share intelligence and best practice on identifying victims and prosecuting perpetrators. Police, prosecutors and border officials on both sides of the Atlantic are pledging better intelligence sharing It is hoped the new agreement will improve existing operations at airports including London Heathrow and JFK in New York and help spot victims as they are taken to parts of the world to be cut, such as North Africa and the Middle East. Dr Hussein, a psychotherapist who had FGM in Somaliawhen she was aged seven, is backing the UK and US efforts. She said: ""The pressure is still there... some of my clients are 19-year-old girls now who were children or were born in this [country] and they will say to you they were pressured in a playground in a school in London to go and have it done."" Dr Hussein, who moved to the UK aged 12 but said she did not know FGM was wrong until years later, said ""education plays a big part, in terms of prevention, because I said if I had some information in my school I might have said something"". She founded the north London-based Dahlia Project to raise awareness and support FGM victims. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external NHS figures in England recorded between April 2015 and March 2018 show more than 16,000 women and girls have undergone FGM at some point in their lives. The 6,195 cases recorded between April 2017 and March this year involved 150 people who were born in the UK and 1,715 born in eastern Africa. FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and further legislation in 2003 and 2005 made it an offence to arrange FGM outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents. But there is yet to be a successful prosecution. The government has put increasing efforts into tackling FGM in recent years and it is compulsory for family doctors, hospitals and mental health trusts to report any new cases in their patients.

"Kate Winslet says living without being able to read and write is like a ""life in hiding"" Kate Winslet has said too many women can be trapped by a sense of ""shame"" over illiteracy - where they conceal problems rather than get help. The actress was speaking at the launch of a National Literacy Trust project to improve literacy skills and employment chances for disadvantaged young women. The charity says almost one in 10 young adult women in the UK has poor skills with reading and writing. Ms Winslet said they were missing out on a ""basic human right"". When patients were unable to read instructions on a medicine bottle or parents could not understand a letter sent home from school, Ms Winslet said, people could be left ""isolated and fearful"" and lacking in any sense of control. ""Every aspect of their everyday lives can be dictated by their inability to read,"" said Ms Winslet, speaking in London. The actress won an Oscar playing a character whose secret was that she was illiterate and she said that researching the role, in The Reader, she had spent time with women who had been too ashamed to admit their problem. ""It was like a life in hiding,"" said Ms Winslet, as illiterate women found ways to avoid revealing how poorly they could read and write. ""They would pretend to blend in."" A lack of confidence with literacy can be a barrier to getting jobs She knew one woman who pretended to have broken her hand and wore a cast whenever she thought she would be asked to fill in a form. The woman even broke off relationships rather than reveal her secret. ""She had spent her life ashamed and living a lie,"" said Ms Winslet. For most people, she said, learning to read was completely taken for granted but a sizeable and unseen minority were stuck with poor literacy levels that crushed their chances. ""It's like living in a country and never learning the language,"" she said. The Words for Work: Women in Leadership project will teach literacy and employment skills, such as writing CVs, in classes running in London, Manchester and Nottingham, with three years of funding from the Lancome cosmetics company. They will be aimed at women aged between 16 and 20 and there will be an emphasis on raising confidence and challenging stereotypes. Girls on average achieve better results than boys in English while at school and are less likely to be illiterate as adults but, the literacy charity says, they can still lack confidence when looking for a job. The rise of an online and digital culture has seen a widening of the gap for those without basic reading and writing ability, the charity says.

"This video can not be played The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage The new US envoy for Syria has said there is ""lots of evidence"" that Syrian government forces are preparing to use chemical weapons in Idlib. Jim Jeffrey said an anticipated offensive against the last major rebel-held area would be a ""reckless escalation"", Reuters reported. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied ever using chemical weapons. Russian planes have bombed rebel areas in the north-western region as troops mass for the expected offensive. Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters How Idlib may be changing Trump's Syria strategy Why is there a war in Syria? It comes as a summit is due to take place in Iran on Friday between the leaders of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Turkey, which has backed some rebel factions. The UN has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if an all-out assault takes place and Turkey fears a new influx of refugees across its border. Improvised gas masks are being tried out in Idlib ahead of the expected offensive ""I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings,"" Mr Jeffrey said in his first interview since being appointed. ""Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation. There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies. Despite Syrian denials, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said they are confident government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. The population of Idlib has been swollen by refugees from other parts of Syria Mr Jeffrey said a ""major diplomatic initiative"" was now needed to end the seven-year civil war. He said there was ""a new commitment"" by President Donald Trump to remain involved in Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) was defeated and to ensure that Iranian fighters - who are supporting the Syrian authorities in the conflict - leave the country. Mr Jeffrey said President Assad had ""no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not Washington's job to oust him. He said the US would work with Russia on a political transition. ""Right now [the Syrian government] is a cadaver sitting in rubble with just half the territory of Syria under regime control on a good day,"" he added. With rebel forces defeated in most of Syria, the offensive in the north-western province of Idlib could prove to be the last major battle of the seven-year civil war. Who's in control of Idlib? There are believed to be up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters in Idlib. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically. Syria: Who's in control of Idlib?

"A significant number of patients requiring serious surgery are having operations postponed, a study suggests. Research led by the Royal College of Anaesthetists and University College London looked at more than 26,000 cases in a seven-day period in March last year, across 245 UK hospitals. They found one in seven operations were cancelled on the day of surgery. However, researchers acknowledged it was likely this figure would be lower during quieter periods of the year. Nonetheless, they said the problem needed addressing as it put the health and welfare of patients at risk. Patients 'left in pain' by surgery delays Hospitals to delay non-urgent operations Operation delays: 'Everything is up in the air' The study,published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia,external, looked at both emergency and planned operations that required a stay in hospital. This would include everything from heart operations and cancer surgery to complex abdominal cases and joint replacements. Researchers also looked at how many people previously had operations cancelled. This was done for those just undergoing planned surgery - not the cases that arrived via A&E. They found that 10% of the 15,000 people requiring a planned operation had experienced having it postponed previously. Around a third of cancellations were for clinical reasons, such as the person not being healthy enough to undergo the treatment. Other reasons cited included a lack of beds, theatres, equipment and staff. For half of patients, no reason was given. Chief investigator Prof Ramani Moonesinghe said it was clear last-minute cancellations were affecting the ""health and welfare of tens of thousands of patients every year"". ""This is not good for patients. We need to find different solutions,"" she said. She added this could include doing more to separate emergency and elective treatments, so A&E pressures did not hamper the ability of hospitals to treat patients coming in for planned surgery. More should also be done to do planned treatments in the quieter summer months, she said. Prof Cliff Shearman, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""It is important to underline that cancelling and rescheduling an operation is not only stressful for patients, but a complete waste of hospital resources. ""It is awful for a patient to have their operation cancelled twice."" NHS bosses said that looking at the overall number of operations done, including minor treatments and day cases, the cancellation rate was significantly lower. Official figures show currently around 1% of all planned operations are cancelled for non-clinical reasons in England. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""This report provides only a selective, limited snapshot of surgery in England, where the NHS is funding more routine operations and more people are undergoing treatment than the year before."" Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Welsh government said: ""It is important to note that not all postponements result in the theatre slot being lost, as more often than not, health boards will have other patients on an agreed stand-by list who can be treated at that time.""

"A planned tax cut for 2.7m self-employed workers has been scrapped by the UK government. It was originally due to scrap Class 2 National Insurance contributions in April but the move had been delayed by a year and has now been shelved. It cited concerns that low-earning self-employed people would pay more to access the state pension, and it would make the tax system more complex. Labour's John McDonnell called it a ""betrayal of the self-employed"". The government was originally due to scrap Class 2 NI contributions, paid by self-employed people with profits of Â£6,205 or more a year, in April 2018 but last year announced it was delaying that for a year. But it announced on Thursday that they would not now be abolished in this Parliament. The move was set to save millions of workers about Â£150 a year. But there had been concerns that the move would hit more than 300,000 self-employed people earning less than Â£6,000 a year who were paying the Class 2 NICs voluntarily, in order to access the state pension. They would have faced being moved to Class 3 contributions, raising weekly payments from Â£2.95 to Â£14.65. John McDonnell said it was a ""betrayal"" of self-employed people In a written statement, Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick said the change had been intended to simplify the tax system for the self-employed but it had ""become clear"" that a ""significant number"" of self-employed people with the lowest profits would have ended up paying more. ""Having listened to those likely to be affected by this change, we have concluded that it would not be right to proceed during this Parliament, given the negative impacts it could have on some of the lowest earning in our society,"" it said. Trying to address the concerns would have meant ""greater complexity to the tax system, undermining the original objective of the policy"". He added: ""The government remains committed to simplifying the tax system for the self-employed and will keep this issue under review in the context of the wider tax system and the sustainability of the public finances."" But shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said: ""This is yet another betrayal of the self-employed. These people are the engine of the economy and have been let down again, while giant corporations have seen their tax bills slashed."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it would hit more than three million people and would ""net the Treasury more than Â£350m annually in the three years to 2021"". FSB Chairman Mike Cherry said the Treasury ""should have worked harder"" to find ways to protect low-earners. ""The self-employed community has been let down today, missing out on a promise to reduce their tax burden. ""This raises serious questions once again about the government's commitment to supporting the self-employed. "" He added: ""Class 2 NICs is a regressive levy that indiscriminately hits sole traders and makes life even tougher for those who are hard-up.""

"Channel 4 is to broadcast adverts overlaid with the abuse that has been directed at the people who feature in them. The people in the ads by Nationwide, McCain and Maltesers were subjected to abusive tweets because they were black, gay or disabled. The companies and Channel 4 say they want to highlight the issue of online abuse. The ads will be aired in the commercial break for Gogglebox on Friday night. It will be introduced as a ""thought provoking ad break"" and warns the ""real comments"" about ""real people"" in the adverts ""may shock you"". A statement from Channel 4 says as a channel ""we stand up for diversity and inclusion"", adding: ""If face-to-face abuse is not tolerated in our society is it right that it's tolerated online?"". Those appearing in the adverts have backed the campaign. This video can not be played Singing stars of TV ad Flo and Joan on the struggles of female comics Actress Samantha Renke who appeared in a Maltesers advert in her wheelchair received comments online including ""normal humans walk on two legs"". She admits she was ""shocked and upset by the comments"". ""However, I am not by any means naÃ¯ve to the world of trolling or online bullying. Any minority or group with something to say is subject to online abuse. ""For me, I've never had people come up and say horrible things to my face, but the internet gives people anonymity. ""This Channel 4 initiative is sparking an important conversation and reminding us that we need to call out those who think it's acceptable to hide behind a screen."" Lee Camozzi and Mat Samuels who are parents who appeared in a McCain advert said they were ""delighted"" to appear in the original advert, because ""it's rare to see advertising which represents our family dynamic, but it was awful to receive such horrible comments"". ""Regardless, we remain proud to be part of an advertisement that celebrates families, whatever form they come in and we're committed to highlighting the problem of online hate speech, alongside Channel 4."" Nationwide's Voices campaign, which used poets and comedians is one of the featured adverts. The campaign hit the headlines when Duo Flo and Joan who appeared in one of the ads revealed they hadreceived death threats. Sara Bennison, Nationwide's Chief Marketing Officer, said ""it's time that we stand up to hate"". She hopes the new ads ""will highlight a growing societal problem where an increasing number of people appear to believe that posting hate speech and threats online is acceptable.""

"This video can not be played Britain's representative Karen Pierce and her Russian counterpart Vasily Nebenzya addressed the UN The US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed with the UK's assessment that Russia's government ""almost certainly"" approved the Salisbury poisoning. They have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. At a UN Security Council meeting to discussthe attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". The head of GCHQ has said the UK's allies would ""reject the Kremlin's brazen determination to undermine the international rules-based order"". In a speech in Washington, Jeremy Fleming said: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active."" He added: ""And it will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies. Able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus."" Mr Fleming said the intelligence community had supported police in a ""painstaking"" and ""highly complex"" investigation into what happened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. The UKnamed two men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. The Kremlin called these accusations ""unacceptable"". Russian spy: What we know so far Russia's scorn for 'cheap soap opera' Could suspects be returned to the UK? What happened to the Skripals? A statement from Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau said: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reiterate our outrage at the use of a chemical nerve agent, known as Novichok, in Salisbury on March 4."" The leaders welcomed progress in the investigation, but urged those with more information to go to UK authorities. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU,"" the statement added. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries in response to the 4 March attack, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". The leaders said the link to the Russian service - revealed on Wednesday - would strengthen their intention to work together against foreign spy networks, the use of chemical weapons, and to ""defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies"". This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? The UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, alongside China and UK allies the US and France, met in New York to discuss the latest progress in the investigation. Addressing the council, Britain's ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce, said the nerve agent attack was a ""direct challenge"" to the ""rules-based international system that has kept all of us safe since 1945"". In a lengthy rebuttal, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". But Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and UK citizens. ""We have lost all hope in finding the truth,"" he said, adding that the latest developments were ""invented out of thin air"". He highlighted a number of so-called ""inconsistencies"", which he said were ""off the charts"", in the UK's evidence. Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday that the two suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports. She told MPs the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. Prosecutors in the UK believe there is sufficient evidence to charge the pair with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act. Police released CCTV showing the two men arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March Russia does not extradite its nationals, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the men travel to the EU. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, werepoisoned with Novichokon 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in nearby Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess and harmed her friend Charlie Rowley.

"Secretary of State Karen Bradley was appointed to the post in January The Secretary of State has said she initially did not understand that nationalists did not vote for unionist parties during elections. Karen Bradley said she did not comprehend that campaigns are generally fought within each part of the community. She told The House magazine that it was ""a very different world from the world I came from"". Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire. Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons. ""I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa,""Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament,external. ""So, the parties fight for election within their own community. ""Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,"" she added. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay. Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution. MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888. In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today."" ""I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn't understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland.""

"Alex Jones is currently being sued for defamation Twitter says it has permanently suspended the accounts of Alex Jones and his Infowars website. It made the move after a number of tweets that violated Twitter's abusive behaviour policy, the company said. A number of tech giants, including YouTube and Facebook, deleted the right-wing conspiracy theorist's content last month, citing hate speech. The radio host is best known for spreading unsubstantiated allegations about tragic events, including 9/11. He is currently being sued for defamation by the parents of two children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which he has repeatedly claimed was a ""giant hoax"". Twenty children under the age of seven and six adults died in the attack. Twitter said the ban was a result of ""new reports of tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behaviour policy, in addition to the accounts' past violations"". It did not specify what the violations were. Facebook, Twitter 'too slow' on meddling Infowars v Sandy Hook case explained Why I'm suing Alex Jones It added that it does ""not typically comment on enforcement actions... against individual accounts"", but was ""open about this action given the broad interest in this case"". Mr Jones has accused media platforms of unfair censorship of his accounts. Twitter had come under criticism last month when it refused to ban InfoWarsand Alex Jones from its platform, despite YouTube, Facebook, Apple and Spotify deleting his content. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said at the time this was because the accounts had not violated the platform's rules - but he vowed to suspend them if they ever did so. Mr Jones mostly uses his Twitter account to share content and videos from InfoWars with his 850,000 followers, and promotes conspiracy theories against liberals, Muslims and migrants. In July, he said that Democrats planned to launch a civil war on 4 July or US Independence Day Last year, he tweeted that Muslims in England were demanding that the Queen either convert to Islam or leave the country. However, the CNN clip Infowars based its article on dates back to 2009 and features a group led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, who by 2017 was already serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence for inviting support for the Islamic State group (IS) He has previously said that ""transgenderism"" is a CIA ""plan to depopulate humanity"" and that the ""normalisation of mental illness"" is an ""evil paedophile plot to sexualise and destroy children"" In 2013, he described then-President Barack Obama as the ""global head of al-Qaeda"", and later accused him of arming IS On Wednesday, Mr Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg answered questions at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about what technology giants are doing to prevent future election meddling. During the hearing, Mr Dorsey was also asked whether Twitter censors conservative voices. Twitter admits 'unfairly' hiding accounts Several Republicans, including US President Donald Trump, have accused Twitter of bias, which the company denies. Mr Dorsey said his company did ""not use political ideology to make any decisions"", but admitted the company's algorithms had not always been ""impartial"". Mr Jones also sat in on the hearing, and made headlines after he confronted Republican Senator Marco Rubio while Mr Rubio was being interviewed. Allow Twitter content?
