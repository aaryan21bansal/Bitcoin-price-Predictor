"Trump accused WHO of a ""horrible, tragic mistake"" in handling of pandemic, ""or perhaps they knew"" The US president renewed attack a day after stopping funding to the global health body Confirmed cases of the virus passed two million, according to Johns Hopkins university The true number of cases will be much higher, with levels of testing varying Germany announced plans to ease restrictions, with some schools to reopen in May New Yorkers were ordered to wear masks in public spaces Health Secretary Matt Hancock says families will be allowed to say goodbye to dying relatives in UK Tour de France will go ahead but moved to late August Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for following our live coverage. We'll be back tomorrow with more. Here are Wednesday's key developments:  Today's live coverage has been brought to you by: Vicky Bisset, Sophie Williams, Michael Emons, Saj Chowdry, Doug Faulkner, Sean Fanning, Deirdre Finnerty, Ritu Prasad, Boer Deng and Jude Sheerin. President Trump was asked by a reporter about claims that Covid-19 had originated in a virology lab in Wuhan and then passed on through the wet market via a lab employee. Trump responded: ""I don't want to say that, but I will tell you more and more we're hearing the story and we'll see. We are doing a very thorough examination of this situation that happened."" Trump is asked about the dangers of re-opening the country while the pandemic is ongoing. ""There's also death involved in keeping it closed,"" Trump says. The president says mental health is a concern, and suicide hotlines ""are exploding"" as people lose their jobs. Drug addiction is also a problem, he says, and claims that people who didn't take drugs before doing so now because ""they have no money coming in"". ""Other than the money we're getting them,"" he adds, referring to the economic stimulus cheques from the government. ""We've opened up the coffers...we're helping people, which is why I wish the Democrats would help us a little bit."" Trump says that the re-opening process will happen in partnership with the state governors, ""as they see fit"". When asked about why his name was on relief cheques, President Trump said he ""didn't know too much about it."" The cheques are being sent to millions of households in America struggling financially because of Covid-19. He said people will be ""very happy"" to get a ""big, fat, beautiful cheque and my name is on it."" Trump said he understood that his name on the cheque was not ""delaying anything."" The Treasury was forced to deny claims on Wednesday that Trump's signature was slowing down its issuance of the cheques. Two senior government tax officers had previously told the Washington Post the move would probably lead to a delay. It is the first time a US president's name will appear on a federal government handout. Critics have accused the president of playing politics, using the financial aid to boost his reputation in an election year. The US agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue has joined Trump at today's briefing. He says the nation's food supply remains safe during the pandemic. ""To Americans who may be worried about access to good food because of this I want to assure you: American food supply is strong, resilient and safe,"" Perdue says. He adds that the supply chain has ""shown tremendous agility"" in moving from restaurant to retail settings. The comments come as reports of grocery workers and food producers falling ill have been making headlines. Smithfield, a major pork producer, was forced to shut two US plants this week after workers tested positive for coronavirus at its facilities. Perdue ends by reminding employers to follow the Centers for Disease Control's best practices to keep employees ""safe and healthy"". Dr Deborah Birx, one of the leaders of the White House task force, says the US has a low fatality rate compared to other nations. She notes that there are nine states with fewer than 1,000 Covid-19 cases and fewer than 30 new cases each day. ""We are looking at states and metro areas as individual areas,"" she says. ""We see as a country, we are improving."" But she cautioned that to keep improving, people must continue to follow social distance guidelines. Even after ""generalised guidelines"" are offered by the White House at the federal level, ""each of these governors and these mayors will have to make decisions...so they can do what's best for their communities,"" she says. Trump says he spoke with top leaders in various fields, including healthcare, technology, finances, hospitality, and agriculture. He says they underscored the need for more protective equipment coming in, robust testing, strong supply chains and good infrastructure. ""We'll be the comeback kids, all of us,"" Trump says. ""Tomorrow's going to be a very big day, we're gonna be speaking with the governors."" He says the re-openings will be ""safe"" and ""strong"" - and soon. ""We want to get our country back,"" Trump says. ""We're gonna do it soon.""  President Trump threatened to adjourn both chambers of Congress after accusing Democrats of holding up his nominations, preventing federal government positions from being filled. Adjourning Congress, he argued, will allow him to make recess appointments. ""We have many many positions that are understaffed because we can't get approval,"" he said. He said the appointments needed to be filled to ""assist with the coronavirus crisis"". ""We have to do what we have to do,"" he said. ""We need people for this crisis."" However, he did not give any examples of coronavirus-related positions that have been left unfilled. Trump has appointed some 200 judges to the federal judiciary, with the Republican-held Senate confirming the jurists on a procedural express lane. It is a judicial revolution - more than a quarter of all currently sitting federal appeals court judges have been appointed by this president. With the US Congress so dysfunctional, these judgesâ rulings will still be shaping US policy on everything from gun control to abortion and voting rights for a generation after Trump leaves office.  Trump again vented his frustrations with the World Health Organization (WHO), saying: ""I have a feeling they knew exactly what was going on"". He says they erroneously criticised his decision to close US borders to China. ""Tragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn't do any form of ban,"" Trump adds. ""You see what happened to Italy, you see what happened to Spain, you see what happened in France."" He calls it a ""horrible tragic mistake - or perhaps they knew"". ""I'm sure they didn't know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew."" The US president's decision to pause funding for the international organisation has drawn scrutiny and scepticism. Our Reality Check team has fact-checked Trump's claims about the WHO here. Trump says the federal government has developed and delivered: He says 100m masks have been distributed to date and 500m more have been ordered. Trump also announced that General Motors has officially finished its first medical ventilator, produced in just 11 days in Kokomo, Indiana. Healthcare workers across the US have grappled with a shortage of protective equipment since the pandemic began. President Trump says tomorrow his administration will announce new guidelines for re-opening ""various states"". The vast majority of Americans are currently under social distancing restrictions to combat the spread of Covid-19. ""It's very exciting,"" the president says. He said that the US has administered 3.3 million Covid tests-- a figure equivalent to about 1% of the US population. The White House briefing has just begun and President Trump is now delivering his remarks. Earlier today, the president held several calls with a number of industry leaders, including healthcare, sports, technology, agriculture, labour, defence, energy and banking groups, to discuss re-opening the nation. This week's previous briefings have made headlines with the president's frustrations with the media, the nation's governors and the World Health Organization. Watch our livestream of the briefing here. New York City's death count has spiked to more than 10,000 after authorities added 3,778 people who likely succumbed to Covid-19, but died without being tested. Firefighters and paramedics had been recording drastic increases in deaths at home around the city, assumed to be caused by the virus. The new figures, from the city's Health Department, mark a 60% rise in deaths. In terms of per-capita death rate, New York City has now outpaced Italy - the country with the highest death toll in Europe. So what does this mean in terms of calculating the US death toll?Read the full story here. The nearly four million residents of Los Angeles, California, may not be allowed to attend any concerts or sports events until 2021, the mayor told CNN. Mayor Eric Garcetti said large gatherings with over 1,000 people will likely be banned until next year due to the pandemic. Covid-19-related deaths are on the rise for the second consecutive day in Los Angeles County. The county's health director said 42 people died on Wednesday and over 400 new cases were confirmed. The mayor's comments echo California Governor Gavin Newsom, who said on Tuesday: âThe prospect of mass gatherings is negligible at best until we get to herd immunity and we get to a vaccine."" A near-deserted park in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv has been taken over by jackals.  In normal times joggers, cyclists and families would flock to Hayarkon Park, but with coronavirus, human visitors are now scarce, making way for dozens of jackals, which are now wandering the park by day as well as night. Zoologist Yariv Malichi told AFP that although the animals feel more comfortable without people, they have come to depend on visitors' rubbish for food and that is now increasingly hard to find because of the lockdown. Sailors have been brought ashore and placed in quarantine Last week the French defence ministry announced 50 sailors aboard its flagship, the Charles de Gaulle aicraft carrier, had come down with coronavirus symptoms. Authorities sent a medical team to test them and to prevent a major outbreak on the ship. Now, the ministry has announced that at least 668 sailors have tested positive from the carrier and an escorting frigate, the Chevalier Paul - with only two-thirds of test results in. The ministry said 31 sailors are in hospital. Charles de Gaulle was on deployment in the Atlantic as part of a Nato exercise. But once the first sailors showed signs of the virus the vessel was ordered back to its base at Toulon. Nearly all the confirmed cases so far are sailors serving on the nuclear-powered carrier. All the ships are now being disinfected, the ministry said. As a gesture to those working in the NHS as they treat patients during the coronavirus outbreak, Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium has lit up three appropriate letters of the club's name. It has earned the congratulations of a former United defender. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some of the questions asked by journalists during Wednesday's daily UK coronavirus briefing focused on care-home workers and residents who are at risk or been affected by Covid-19. So how big is the issue? And is it possible to get accurate figures about the scale of the problem? BBC Newshas provided information to some of the pertinent questions, such as:  Read more here. The White House' daily Covid-19 briefing is due to begin shortly. This week, briefings have made headlines not for updates to the pandemic in the US, but for President Donald Trump's comments on the media, his own authority to re-open the nation and his frustrations with the World Health Organization.

"This video can not be played Mr Hancock said wanting to be with a loved one at the end of their life is ""one of the deepest human instincts"" Close family members will be able to see dying relatives to say goodbye under new coronavirus guidelines, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He said the UK would introduce new steps to ""limit the risk of infection"" and allow goodbyes ""wherever possible"". Mr Hancock also launched a new network to supply personal protective equipment (PPE) to care home staff. It comes as the number of hospital deaths in the UK rose by 761 to 12,868. How coronavirus changed death, grief and funerals Coronavirus: Wednesday's evening update Virus tests promised for care homes Many loved ones have been unable to say goodbye to family and friends since stringent restrictions were introduced on life in the UK on 23 March. Mr Hancock highlighted the death ofIsmail Mohamed Abdulwahab, 13, from Brixton, south London. Ismail died alone in hospital last month and his close family were thenunable to attend his funeralbecause they were self-isolating. Speaking at Wednesday's briefing, Mr Hancock said the reports made him ""weep"". ""Wanting to be with someone at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts,"" he said. ""It's a moment that will be with you forever. Done right it can help those left behind cope and it brings comfort to those who are dying."" New government guidelines for social care providers,published shortly after the briefing,external, say that care homes should still ""limit unnecessary visits"" but advises that ""visits at the end of life... should continue"". It also outlines how ministers hope to get PPE to care providers most in need - including an emergency 24/7 helpline. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has made big play of the fact relatives are to be allowed to visit dying family in care homes. This was already allowed under guidance issued on 2 April, but many care homes have blocked visiting because of concern about spread of the virus, partly fuelled by a lack of protective equipment. The same applies to hospitals. It has meant many people with Covid-19 have died with no family or friends around them. Just because a minister says it is allowed, it does not mean it will happen. On the frontline, staff are under huge pressure and are reluctant to take risks. Care providers have been calling for more testing and PPE for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. In Scotland, new figures suggesta quarter of deaths linked to coronavirus have occurred in care homes. In England and Wales there were217 deaths in care homes by 3 April. That number is known to now be much higher. Twenty-four residents havedied after an outbreak at one care home in Staffordshire. Earlier, the governmentpromised to test care home residents and staff with Covid-19 symptomsas laboratory capacity increases. At the news conference, Mr Hancock extended the promise on testing to include anyone moving from hospital into social care. Previous guidance said only the first five residents with Covid-19 symptoms in each care home needed to be tested to confirm that an outbreak was taking place. England's care regulator, the Care Quality Commission, says it has started contacting care providers to book tests for staff who are self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. Twenty-four die at care home during outbreak New care home outbreaks lead to 32 deaths In response to Mr Hancock's announcements, Labour's shadow minister for social care Liz Kendall said that workers ""really need to see action and not just words"". She told BBC News there were sill questions over the government's strategy - such as how those who test positive while in care can be isolated effectively. And she called for ""rapid action"" to increase testing and to get more PPE to the front line. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Hancock also announced a ""badge of honour"" to allow care workers to ""proudly and publicly identify themselves"" during the pandemic - in a bid to boost public recognition of all those in caring roles. And he said supermarkets have been asked to ensure social care workers are given the same priority access as NHS staff. The badge Mr Hancock displayed was in fact launched by Care England, which represents care home providers, in 2019. Rehana Azam, national officer of the GMB union, said care workers ""need more than a badge and a pat on their head to define their precious role in society"". ""They need the protective equipment and testing on the front line now to protect their lives,"" she said. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said the restrictions on movement were ""starting to work"" but warned ""we will not lift these measures until it is safe to do so"". Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks - with the first assessment carried out by Thursday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock displays the ""badge of honour"" devised for care workers Deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Angela McLean, said there was continuing evidence that the social distancing measures were having an impact on the rate of people testing positive for Covid-19. The numbers of coronavirus patients in hospital beds have also fallen, she said. On Tuesday, the number fell by 1% across the UK, and by 5% in London. ""We expected everywhere to be the same. That is not exactly what we are seeing,"" she said. She said the number of people in hospital in London with coronavirus was falling faster than elsewhere perhaps because cases rose faster in the capital and then people responded to advice more quickly. NHS bosses have told the BBC that hospitalsshould be able to cope with an expected peak in coronavirus cases.

"The global economy will contract by 3% this year as countries around the world shrink at the fastest pace in decades, the International Monetary Fund says. The IMF described the global decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It said the pandemic had plunged the world into a ""crisis like no other"". The Fund added that a prolonged outbreak would test the ability of governments and central banks to control the crisis. Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, said the crisis could knock $9 trillion (Â£7.2 trillion) off global GDP over the next two years. While the Fund's latest World Economic Outlook praised the ""swift and sizeable"" response in countries like the UK, Germany, Japan and the US, it said no country would escape the downturn. It expects global growth to rebound to 5.8% next year if the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020. Ms Gopinath said today's ""Great Lockdown"" presented a ""grim reality"" for policymakers, who faced ""severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock"". ""A partial recovery is projected for 2021,"" said Ms Gopinath. ""But the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound. ""Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely."" The IMF predicts the UK economy will shrink by 6.5% in 2020, compared with the IMF's January forecast for 1.4% GDP growth. A decline of this magnitude would be bigger than the 4.2% drop in output seen in the wake of the financial crisis. It would also represent the biggest annual fall since 1921, according to reconstructed Bank of England data dating back to the 18th century. However, this is half the annual rate expected by the OBR, which expects GDP to drop by 35% in the three months to June. The UK's furlough scheme, which isdesigned to keep workers in a jobamid the government lockdown, is expected to limit the rise in unemployment to 4.8% in 2020, from 3.8% last year. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged billions of pounds in wage subsidies and loan guarantees to help workers and businesses through the shutdown. TheBank of England has also slashed interest rates to a new lowand freed up billions of pounds for commercial banks to lend. Ms Gopinath said that for the first time since the Great Depression, both advanced and developing economies were expected to fall into recession. The IMF warned that growth in advanced economies would not get back to its pre-virus peak until at least 2022. The US economy is expected to contract by 5.9% this year, representing the biggest annual decline since 1946. Unemployment in the US is also expected to jump to 10.4% this year. A partial recovery is expected in 2021, with expected US growth of 4.7%. The Chinese economy is expected to expand by just 1.2% this year, which would be the slowest growth since 1976. Australia is expected to suffer its first recession since 1991. The IMF warned that there were ""severe risks of a worse outcome"". It said that if the pandemic took longer to control and there was a second wave in 2021, this would knock an additional 8 percentage points off global GDP. The Fund said this scenario could trigger a downward spiral in heavily-indebted economies. It said investors might be unwilling to lend to some of these nations, which would push up borrowing costs. The IMF added: ""This increase in sovereign borrowing costs or simply fear of it materialising, could prevent many countries from providing the income support assumed here."" While longer lockdowns will constrain economic activity, the IMF said quarantines and social distancing measures were vital. It said: ""Upfront containment measures are essential to slow the spread of the virus and allow health care systems to cope and to help pave the way for an earlier and more robust resumption of economic activity. ""Uncertainty and reduced demand for services could be even worse in a scenario of greater spread without social distancing"" The IMF set out four priorities for dealing with the pandemic. It called for more money for health care systems, financial support for workers and businesses, continued central bank support and a clear exit plan for the recovery. It urged the world to work together to find and distribute treatments and a vaccine. The Fund added that many developing nations would need debt relief in the coming months and years.

"This video can not be played ""When we are divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us,"" the WHO director-general said US President Donald Trump has been heavily criticised for halting funding for the World Health Organization (WHO) amid the global coronavirus pandemic. Philanthropist Bill Gates, a major funder of the WHO, said it was ""as dangerous as it sounds"". President Trump said on Tuesday that the body had ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to coronavirus. The head of the WHO said it was reviewing the cuts' impact ""to ensure our work continues uninterrupted"". ""We regret the decision of the President of the United States to order a halt in the funding to the WHO,"" Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference, adding that the US has been ""a long-standing and generous friend... and we hope it will continue to be so"".

""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told reporters on Tuesday. A White House statement on Wednesday said the agency had ""failed"" the US people. ""The American people deserve better from the WHO, and no more funding will be provided until its mismanagement, cover-ups and failures can be investigated,"" it read. Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China. He has accused the WHO of having ""criticised"" that decision, an apparent reference to general advice from the agency against travel restrictions. The US is the global health body's largest single funder and gave it more than $400m in 2019. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is funding Covid-19 treatment and vaccine research, is the second-largest funder. Allow Twitter content?

It is not the first time the WHO's response to the outbreak has come under scrutiny. On 14 January,the organisation tweeted,externalthat preliminary Chinese investigations had found ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" of the new virus. Mr Trump and others have used the tweet to attack the WHO for simply believing China, despite evidence to the contrary. But about a week after that tweet, on 22 January,the agency released a public statement saying that human-to-human transmission did appear to be taking place in Wuhan.,external At the end of January, on the same day it declared a public health emergency, the WHO said that travel restrictions were not needed to stop the spread of Covid-19 -advice that was eventually ignored by most countries,external, including by the Trump administration the next day.

Meanwhile, some health experts also say thatthe WHO's guidance on face masks has led to public confusion,external. Other frequently-made criticisms of the WHO more generally are that it is constrained by politics and a sprawling bureaucracy.

"All care home residents and staff with Covid-19 symptoms will be tested for coronavirus as laboratory capacity increases, the government has promised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""determined"" to ensure everyone who needed a test had access to one. Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, welcomed the pledge but predicted ""logistical challenges"". It comes as a further 761 hospital deaths were announced in the UK, bringing the total to 12,868. Care providers been calling for more testing for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. At the moment only the first five residents who show symptoms in a care home are tested, to determine whether there is an outbreak of the virus. Providers have also complained that deaths among residents were being""airbrushed"" out of official figuresand demanded greater support for the industry. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isurging the government to publish an exit strategyfrom the coronavirus lockdown. Sir Keir said his party would support the government if, as expected, it extends lockdown measures later this week. But he called for more transparency about how and when the rules will be relaxed. Testing and why it matters Care homes cause concern for families Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures On Wednesday, 651 new deaths were announced in England, 84 in Scotland,60 in Walesand six in Northern Ireland. The totals can differ fromthe number reported by the Department of Health and Social Care,externalfor the whole of the UK, as they are based on different reporting periods. BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said only Scotland and Wales had seen a post-weekend spike in deaths due to delays in reporting caused by the Easter weekend, giving hope that the daily death toll had stopped rising. ""The overall picture for the UK is almost a week with no growth in the number of deaths announced every day. This adds to the evidence that the lockdown has stopped the growth of the coronavirus,"" he said. But he added that more data was needed to know for sure, and the high number of deaths remained a shocking and sad feature of daily life. In theory, increasing the amount of testing in care homes will be certainly possible as capacity increases. Over the next 10 days, extra facilities from commercial partners are expected to become available. The most tests carried out in one day is 18,000. Doing around 50,000 a day certainly looks possible in the coming weeks, but the 100,000 a day pledged by the government will be a stretch. Logistically, delivering the testing will remain challenging. More than 400,000 frail and vulnerable people are spread across more than 15,000 locations in England alone. Compare that to around 200 hospitals and it is easy to see how difficult it will be to get out to homes to carry out the tests and then process them quickly enough. Government officials have always recognised care homes will be the weakest link in the chain of protection they have tried to wrap around the British public. The nature of care home residents, many of whom struggle with dementia, means it can be difficult for them to follow social distancing and good hand hygiene guidance. They rely on care home staff for intimate personal care, putting both staff and residents at risk as soon as the virus gets into a home. Now the virus is circulating in care homes, slowing the spread and saving lives is going to be incredibly difficult. Every year around 150,000 care home residents die - the fear now is that the number could increase dramatically. All these sets of figures are only for deaths in hospital. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, which includes every community death linked to Covid-19 in England and Wales, showed 406 such deaths registered up to 3 April had occurred outside of hospitals - 217 of them in care homes. The number is expected to have increased since then. In Scotland, there have been 237 deaths in care homes with coronavirus mentioned on the death certificate,according to figures released on Wednesday. Britain's largest care home operator, HC-One, said the virus represented about one-third of all deaths at HC-One's care homes over the last three weeks. And MHA, a charity which operates 131 homes, said it had recorded 210 coronavirus-related deaths to date. Claire Rencher, manager of Veronica House Nursing Home in Tipton, in the West Midlands, told the BBC that some residents had gone to A&E and come back without being tested. She said she did not feel the home was getting the support it needed from government, while staff said they felt ""vulnerable"", especially due to the lack of PPE. How big is the problem in care homes? Eight coronavirus deaths at Merseyside care home We can cope with virus peak, hospital bosses say Mr Hancock said he would ensure anyone in a care home with symptoms of the virus, as well as any new care home residents being discharged from hospital into care, would be tested. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is co-ordinating the effort and will offer tests to the UK's 30,000 care providers by the end of the week, the Department for Health and Social Care said. Gail Grant is worried about the virus reaching Ian's care home Gail Grant, from Swindon in Wiltshire,has not been able to visit her husband Ian for three weeks. Ian, a former dentist, has dementia and lives in a care home in Marlborough, some 12 miles away. He turned 70 this month. ""Because of his cognitive level, we can't Skype or talk on the phone. He doesn't have any understanding of the situation and doesn't really know us anymore. But it's more me - I'm aware I'm not going to see him,"" Dr Grant says. ""They say they don't have any cases at the moment at his home. But I think it's a matter of time. And when any carers go down with it, it will be a difficult situation."" She says of the official figures currently just including hospital deaths: ""What right do they have to withhold information that should be in the public domain?"" Prof Green said the roll-out poses a ""major challenge"" and stressed the need to make sure there are enough tests, and to work out how to carry out tests in care homes while keeping residents safe. He said the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) has ""started to improve"" but that there has been ""conflicting guidance"" about how it is used. Social care minister Helen Whately told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had delivered more than 7 million facemasks to care providers, set up an emergency supply line to contact for PPE, and distributed stocks to local resilience forums. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health She said they have done a ""a huge amount to help get PPE to the front line"" but acknowledged it was still ""worrying"" for places where stocks were running low. Mr Hancock is set to give further details of the testing scheme when the government's coronavirus social care action plan is outlined on Wednesday. This video can not be played Peterborough care home boss moves in as third of residents die The government said its increased tests in care homes will bring it closer to the target ofcompleting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.

Dr Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, told BBC Newsnight the government was ""nowhere near"" hitting its target.

"Though she eased lockdown measures, Ms Merkel also strongly recommended people wear face masks German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced plans to slowly ease restrictions brought in to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Social distancing rules will stay in place until at least 3 May, with Ms Merkel also recommending the use of face masks in shops and on public transport. But as of next week shops under a certain size could open their doors. And schools will gradually start to reopen from 4 May. Ms Merkel said the country had achieved ""fragile intermediate success"" through the strict measures. The chancellor said the country ""must keep focused and keep going"", adding that they ""do not have a lot of room for manoeuvre"". Large public gatherings including religious services will remain banned until 31 August. Bars, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and music venues will all remain closed.

Belgium will maintain its restrictions until at least 3 May. And in Russia, veterans groups have called for President Vladimir Putin to postpone the World War Two 75th anniversary victory parade planned for 9 May, because of the risk it could pose to participants. After a video conference with the heads of Germany's 16 states, Ms Merkel announced the gradual loosening of the strict lockdown measures. Schools can reopen ""gradually and very slowly"" after 4 May, she said, with new safety measures for breaks and school buses, and priority given to those students with exams. ""It will be a great logistical effort and it needs very careful preparation,"" she said. Shops of up to 800 square metres (8,600 sq ft) could be able to restart their businesses from Monday, provided they have ""plans to maintain hygiene"", she said. Car dealers, bicycle shops and book stores can all reopen, regardless of their size. Hairdressers will be allowed to open their doors from 4 May, provided they too comply with strict hygiene measures. Angela Merkel has recommended people wear face masks while in public But the lockdown is far from over. The chancellor strongly recommended people don protective face masks while shopping and while taking public transport, saying this ""will help to protect other people"".

"High Street fashion chains Oasis and Warehouse have fallen into administration, leading to more than 200 immediate job losses. Some 1,800 staff across the shops, concessions and head office will be furloughed and receive 80% of pay. The brands will continue to be sold online ""short-term"" while the administrators try to sell the brand. Administrator Deloitte said the coronavirus had had a ""devastating effect on the entire retail industry"". The owner of the High Street brands, Icelandic bank Kaupthing, had been in talks to sell the businesses before the coronavirus crisis. However, the crisis, which has seen many shops temporarily close, made the sale untenable. Rob Harding, joint administrator at Deloitte, said it had seen ""significant interest from potential buyers"", but that it had not been possible to save the business ""in its current form"". ""As administrators, we appreciate the cooperation and support from the management, employees, customers, landlords and suppliers, whilst we investigate options for the business. This is clearly an unprecedented and difficult time,"" he added. Hash Ladha, the chief executive  of Oasis Warehouse, said: ""This is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and difficult news for all of us. ""We as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love."" There is expected to be interest from bidders to buy the business, a source said on Tuesday, but with the current economic uncertainty, it is not clear how many jobs ultimately could be saved. Deloitte has furloughed 1,800 of the employees under the government Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, while 41 head office roles will be kept on to help the administrators. The chains were forced to shut their 92 UK stores because of the coronavirus lockdown. The group also has 437 concessions in department stores including Debenhams and Selfridges. Oasis and Warehouse, along with fellow group members The Idle Man and Bastyan Fashions, have gone into administration. Operations in Ireland, Sweden and worldwide franchise partners are not in administration. High Street retailers in the UK were facing a tough environment before the crisis, because of rising costs and changes in people's shopping habits. But the temporary closure of many shops during the coronavirus pandemic has heaped more pressure on retailers. Independent retail expert Clare Bailey said retailers had already been under strain for the last two or three years because of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its effect on consumer confidence. ""[Coronavirus] was the final straw of all the straws that broke the camel's already very broken back,"" she said. What does it mean to declare insolvency? Debenhams to file for administration Cath Kidston set to call in administrators Some retailers, such as Primark, have opted to cancel orders with their suppliers. Meanwhile, fashion chain New Look recently informed its suppliers that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centre would be delayed ""indefinitely"". Last week, department store chain Debenhams, which employs about 22,000 staff, confirmed it had entered administration for the second time in a year. Its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with government guidance and the firm said it would work to ""reopen and trade as many stores as possible"" when restrictions end. At the same time, floral fashion firm Cath Kidston filed for administration, putting 950 jobs at risk. Kathleen Brooks, founder and director of consultancy Minerva Analysis, said that while a number of retailers had been struggling for some time, ""the difference now is there aren't necessarily buyers to buy them, so in this environment, they may go under. ""They may cease to exist because no one is willing to take a punt on the retail sector, which really seems to be at the epicentre of this coronavirus crisis from an economic point of view.""

"Apple has announced a new iPhone SE, reviving a mid-market brand it had discontinued in 2018. It resembles the form of 2017's iPhone 8 with a 4.7in screen, and a fingerprint ID sensor but not a depth camera for facial recognition. It is powered by the same processor as the flagship iPhone 11 Pro, but lacks multiple rear cameras. The handset costs the same as the original SE in the US, but is more expensive in other markets. The iPhone SE is priced at $399 in the US and Â£419 in the UK. One analyst said that having a mid-range phone again could help Apple compete for new customers against rivals such as Samsung and Google, which have a strong presence in that market sector. ""Once you buy an iPhone you are more likely to buy another one,"" said Dan Iver from Wedbush Securities. Despite Covid-19 causing lower demand, smartphone makers continue to release models. Earlier this week, OnePlus unveiled new models, and last month Huawei launched its flagship P40 range. In February, Apple warned that the coronavirus lockdown in China would impact iPhone production and lower sales. Physical stores, including Apple's, remain closed in many countries. Apple warns coronavirus will hurt iPhone supplies Samsung unveils S20 flagship and folding Flip phone But Mr Iver expects the phone to sell between 20 million and 25 million units in the first six to nine months. ""Apple's hands are almost being forced to bring this out because from a supply chain perspective it was ready,"" he said. But he added that while competitors might be similarly priced, ""Apple is this golden brand"". The device supports wireless charging. Its rear-facing camera's resolution is 12 megapixels and can still create background blur in portrait photos, despite lacking a second lens. The selfie camera is 7MP. Mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi also said Apple's brand appeal would help it in this price range. ""The second-hand market is pretty vibrant for Apple so are there users who have never have a new iPhone that will want one, and can afford it at this price,"" said the Creative Strategies consultant. But she also warned: ""I think the phone has to have some compromises. It can't be too close to the iPhone 11 or a iPhone XR - or what is the point?"" The iPhone SE goes on sale on 24 April.

"Police have been patrolling parks, where playgrounds have been closed during the lockdown Reports of anti-social behaviour have increased substantially during the coronavirus outbreak, police have said. In the last four weeks, there were 178,000 incidents across England and Wales - a rise of 59% on last year. The National Police Chiefs' Council, which published the figures, said the rise was likely linked to breaches of lockdown measures - with more than 3,200 fines issued in England. Overall, crime fell 28% - with rape and burglary allegations down 37%. The figures covered the four weeks to 12 April. What can the police fine you for doing? Police told to be 'consistent' on lockdown powers Scammers use coronavirus 'hook' to target victims Â£1m cocaine haul hidden in face mask shipment Martin Hewitt, chair of the NPCC, said it was not surprising that crime had dropped significantly given that pubs, bars and most shops were closed and people were staying at home. Other figures showed that shoplifting plummeted by 54%, with serious assaults, robbery and car crime all down by 27%. There were also reductions in 999 and 101 calls, as more people reported offences online. However, the figures do not include fraud. Lynne Owens, director-general of the National Crime Agency, warned that criminals were exploiting the crisis by trying to sell Covid-19 testing kits and protection equipment. ""Fraudsters are playing on people's fear,"" she said.

She said the NCA was ""very alive"" to the potential for rivalry between drug gangs because the wholesale and retail price of cocaine had risen. Meanwhile,Border Force said they had discovered about 14 kilos of cocaine hiddenin a consignment of protective face masks which were being transported through the Channel Tunnel. The driver, a 34-year-old man, was arrested. Border Force regional director Ian Hanson said it was a ""despicable"" attempt to exploit the pandemic. Deputy Chief Constable Sara Glenn, who is head of enforcement for the NPCC during the lockdown, said in the past week there had been an increase in serious violence, which could be linked to addicts finding it harder to get drugs.

IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The NPCC said between 27 March and 13 April, police in England issued 3,203 fines, with a further 290 given to people in Wales over the bank holiday weekend. More than 80% of the penalty notices were imposed on men, while 39 were mistakenly issued to children - aged 16 and 17 - who by law cannot be fined. The fines were rescinded. Mr Hewitt said there was no evidence that the fines were being issued disproportionately to black and ethnic minority groups. In total, 26 fines were imposed on people aged 65 to 100.

"Eastern European farm workers are being flown to the UK on charter flights to pick fruit and vegetable crops. Air Charter Service has told the BBC that the first flight will land on Thursday in Stansted carrying 150 Romanian farm workers. The firm told the BBC that the plane is the first of up to six set to operate between mid-April and the end of June. Government department Defra said it was encouraging people across the UK ""to help bring the harvest in"". British farmers recently warned that crops could be left to rot in the field because of a shortage of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe. Travel restrictions due to the coronavirus lockdown have meant most workers have stayed at home. Several UK growers have launched a recruitment drive, calling for local workers to join the harvest to prevent millions of tonnes of fruit and vegetables going to waste. However, concerns remain that they won't be able to fulfil the demand on farms. Five ways the pandemic is hitting global food industry Thousands apply for fruit and veg grower jobs One of the UK's biggest fresh food producers, G's Fresh, based in Cambridgeshire, confirmed it chartered two out of the six flights carrying Eastern European farm workers from Romania. Derek Wilkinson, managing director of G's Fresh's Sandfield Farms division, told the BBC that the 150 workers arriving at Stansted from eastern Romania on Thursday will be taken by bus to farms in East Anglia to pick lettuce. The firm said the group will be screened on arrival in the UK, will be socially distanced, and anyone found to have a temperature will be quarantined. Mr Wilkinson said his business needed 3,000 seasonal workers, with the greatest need in May at the start of the spring onion harvest, followed by the pea and bean crop in June. He added that the company had had a good response to a recruitment campaign aimed at local workers. So far, 500 British people have registered their interest. Many UK growers depend on seasonal migrant workers from Eastern Europe The Air Charter Service, a private firm, has already arranged flights for seasonal workers in other countries. It flew 1,000 farm workers to Germany from Bulgaria and Romania in recent weeks. The workers will board in Iasi, eastern Romania, after having their temperatures taken and filling out a health questionnaire. The BBC understands that they will be taken from the airport by minibuses to farms in the South East and the Midlands. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said up to 70,000 fruit and vegetable pickers were needed. It is calling for a modern-day ""land army"" of UK workers. NFU vice president Tom Bradshaw told the BBC: ""Growers that rely on seasonal workers to grow, pick and pack our fresh fruit, veg and flowers are extremely concerned about the impact coronavirus restrictions may have on their ability to recruit this critical workforce this season."" ""In the meantime, I would encourage anyone who is interested in helping pick for Britain this summer to contact one of the approved agricultural recruiters."" This video can not be played Coronavirus career pivot: 'I now work in a supermarket' A national campaign is appealing to students and those who have lost their jobs in bars, cafes and shops to help with the harvest. Several schemes have been set up to recruit new workers. They include one by the charity Concordia, which typically helps young people arrange experiences abroad, and another by the industry bodies British Summer Fruit and British Apples and Pears. Data released to the BBC last week by job search engines suggested that those recruitment efforts might be paying off. Totaljobs said it had seen 50,000 searches for farming jobs in one week alone. It added that searches for terms such as ""fruit picker"" or ""farm worker"" had surged by 338% and 107% respectively. Indeed.co.uk said that there had been a huge spike in interest for fruit picker jobs in particular. Between 18 March and 1 April, there was an increase of more than 6,000% in searches for these roles on its website. Meanwhile, Monster said the number of UK users searching for ""farm"" or ""farm worker"" jobs had nearly tripled. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories STRESS:How to look after your mental health The charity Concordia said the response had been ""phenomenal"", but that a labour shortage was still expected. Stephanie Maurel, its chief executive, told the BBC's Today programme that 36,000 people had registered interest and more than 6,000 had conducted a video interview. But in the last 10 days, while almost 900 people had been offered jobs, just 112 have agreed contracts to accept employment. ""We've got brilliant people who are ready to work, but the reality of a job when it comes to it hasn't really matched their circumstances, so we're just working through that at the moment,"" Ms Maurel said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was ""working hard with industry to ensure farmers and growers have the support they need"" for harvesting produce. ""We are encouraging as many people as possible to take part in seasonal working opportunities across the country to help bring the harvest in, and recruitment efforts by industry are well under way,"" a Defra spokesperson said.

"The negotiators met face-to-face before the virus outbreak halted meetings The UK and and EU negotiators have agreed to stage three further rounds of talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. David Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, and the European Commission's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, discussed progress via video conference. The new timetable was confirmed in a joint statement, which described the talks as ""constructive"". Downing Street has consistently said it is committed to agreeing a deal by December 2020. The dates have been set for three full weeks of talks commencing on 20 April, 11 May and 1 June. Face to face talks were cancelled last monthbecause of the coronavirus outbreak- and Mr Frost and Mr Barnier both spent a period in self-isolation due to the virus. Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? UK-EU trade talks will be tricky from the outset What happens after Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide During Wednesday's meeting, the negotiating teams evaluated work that has taken place since both sidesexchanged legal text in March. The joint statement said that, while the work had helped to ""identify all major areas of divergence and convergence"", there was agreement that further negotiating rounds were needed ""in order to make real, tangible progress in the negotiations by June"". Mr Frost and Mr Barnier also discussed the implementation of theWithdrawal Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement with the EU, the UK has until the end of the year - during which it will continue to follow most Brussels rules - to reach a deal. It was also agreed that specialised committees on Northern Ireland and on citizens' rights would also meet soon. On Tuesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government wanted to see future relationship talks with the EU concluded by the end of this year. He said: ""I'm confident that that work can continue and hopefully reach a satisfactory conclusion, but we remain committed to the timeline that we set out.""

"BT Tower in London is a major communications hub Huawei's involvement in the most sensitive parts of EE's mobile network is to continue longer than planned. In December 2018, owner BT said it would take just two years to remove Huawei equipment from its core network. But it now says ""100% of core mobile traffic"" will be on its new Ericsson-built equipment by 2023, the government deadline announced in January 2020. And it blames the government for also ruling 65% of the network's periphery must be rid of Huawei equipment too. Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks Huawei warns UK against 5G U-turn after pandemic Government wins vote after Huawei rebellion A mobile phone network's core is sometimes likened to its heart or brain. It is where voice and other data is routed across various sub-networks and computer servers to ensure it reaches its destination. Meanwhile, the network's periphery, its radio access network, includes the base stations and antennas that link individual mobile devices to the core. Read more ""In order to hit these ambitious targets within the timescales laid down by government and to align with their focus on 5G networks, it is now our intention to prioritise migrating our 5G customers to the new Ericsson core, followed by our 4G customers,"" a spokesman said. Meanwhile, the United States continues to pressure officials to ban Huawei outright anddozens of Conservative MPs went against their own party last monthin an attempt to do so. Former International Trade and Defence Secretary Liam Fox MP was one of them. Reacting to the delay in removing Huawei from BT's core network, he said: ""Recent events have shown how necessary it is to disentangle China from UK security infrastructure.

"Supermarket workers should be trained to identify and help domestic abuse victims during the pandemic through a code word system, MPs have been told. Dame Vera Baird, Victims Commissioner for England and Wales, said a scheme based on theAsk for Angela campaignto combat sexual violence was badly needed to help people during the lockdown. Going shopping was one of few ""channels of escape"" for victims, she said. Calls to domestic abuse help lines have increased in the past three weeks. The government has set aside an extra Â£2m to support domestic abuse services while the Home Office has launched an initiative called'You Are Not Alone',externalto help those experiencing domestic abuse. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said those at risk would get the ""right support"", adding ""there are so many costs to this awful epidemic and this is sadly one of them"". Earlier, Dame Vera told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that the pandemic posed a unique challenge in terms of identifying and protecting vulnerable women and men. Domestic abuse services to get Â£2m amid lockdown Domestic abuse calls 'up 25% since lockdown' Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK She said there was evidence of a marked increase in killings of women by men, including by current or previous partners, since strict restrictions on people's movements were imposed on 23 March. She said there had been, on average, five such deaths a week since then, much higher than the average of two a week over the equivalent period in previous years. She said the figures - which were based on research by the Counting Dead Women project - showed the ""scale of the crisis"". The police have said they have not, as yet, seen a spike in domestic violence crimes since the virus struck, while overall crime reported to police in England and Wales has dropped by around 20% in recent weeks. Charities believe that perpetrators will use the lockdown to further isolate their victims and stop them getting help. But Dame Vera said supermarkets and pharmacies could be asked to play a role in helping those ""locked"" in their homes and only making occasional forays. ""You may be a very controlled person but the likelihood is that you are still being sent out to buy the food,"" she said. She said if a victim was able to visit a supermarket she or he could use an agreed code word to discreetly ask for help, enabling a member of staff to alert either the police or a woman's refuge. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health A similar system was introduced in bars and other venues in England in 2016, with anyone who feared they were in danger of being a victim of a sexual assault being encouraged to ask for 'Angela' as a sign they needed help. Dame Vera urged ministers to talk to retailers about such a system, which she said was recently introduced in France. While many victims would not feel able to speak directly to a stranger, she said checkout staff and other workers would be able to respond quickly if they were prompted with a code word. ""We need to be flexible as people are locked in their homes and this is one channel of escape,"" she added. Dame Vera also warned that women's refuges were largely full up and she appealed to ministers to do more to persuade hotel chains and universities to offer accommodation where available. Also appearing before MPs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs said domestic violence and Covid-19 were a ""deadly combination"" and victims should be given more time to report abuse to the police. Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said while it supported the government's effort to save lives by restricting movement, she said the reality was that many women were ""not safe"" in their homes. Campaigners welcomed last week's promise by government of Â£750m in emergency financial support for charities but said they were worried about how it would be ""fairly"" allocated. Baljit Banga, executive director of Imkaan, said many BAME organisations were not part of the current system of support administered by local authorities or police and crime commissioners.

"Supermarket workers should be trained to identify and help domestic abuse victims during the pandemic through a code word system, MPs have been told. Dame Vera Baird, Victims Commissioner for England and Wales, said a scheme based on theAsk for Angela campaignto combat sexual violence was badly needed to help people during the lockdown. Going shopping was one of few ""channels of escape"" for victims, she said. Calls to domestic abuse help lines have increased in the past three weeks. The government has set aside an extra Â£2m to support domestic abuse services while the Home Office has launched an initiative called'You Are Not Alone',externalto help those experiencing domestic abuse. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said those at risk would get the ""right support"", adding ""there are so many costs to this awful epidemic and this is sadly one of them"". Earlier, Dame Vera told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that the pandemic posed a unique challenge in terms of identifying and protecting vulnerable women and men. Domestic abuse services to get Â£2m amid lockdown Domestic abuse calls 'up 25% since lockdown' Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK She said there was evidence of a marked increase in killings of women by men, including by current or previous partners, since strict restrictions on people's movements were imposed on 23 March. She said there had been, on average, five such deaths a week since then, much higher than the average of two a week over the equivalent period in previous years. She said the figures - which were based on research by the Counting Dead Women project - showed the ""scale of the crisis"". The police have said they have not, as yet, seen a spike in domestic violence crimes since the virus struck, while overall crime reported to police in England and Wales has dropped by around 20% in recent weeks. Charities believe that perpetrators will use the lockdown to further isolate their victims and stop them getting help. But Dame Vera said supermarkets and pharmacies could be asked to play a role in helping those ""locked"" in their homes and only making occasional forays. ""You may be a very controlled person but the likelihood is that you are still being sent out to buy the food,"" she said. She said if a victim was able to visit a supermarket she or he could use an agreed code word to discreetly ask for help, enabling a member of staff to alert either the police or a woman's refuge. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health A similar system was introduced in bars and other venues in England in 2016, with anyone who feared they were in danger of being a victim of a sexual assault being encouraged to ask for 'Angela' as a sign they needed help. Dame Vera urged ministers to talk to retailers about such a system, which she said was recently introduced in France. While many victims would not feel able to speak directly to a stranger, she said checkout staff and other workers would be able to respond quickly if they were prompted with a code word. ""We need to be flexible as people are locked in their homes and this is one channel of escape,"" she added. Dame Vera also warned that women's refuges were largely full up and she appealed to ministers to do more to persuade hotel chains and universities to offer accommodation where available. Also appearing before MPs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs said domestic violence and Covid-19 were a ""deadly combination"" and victims should be given more time to report abuse to the police. Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said while it supported the government's effort to save lives by restricting movement, she said the reality was that many women were ""not safe"" in their homes. Campaigners welcomed last week's promise by government of Â£750m in emergency financial support for charities but said they were worried about how it would be ""fairly"" allocated. Baljit Banga, executive director of Imkaan, said many BAME organisations were not part of the current system of support administered by local authorities or police and crime commissioners. ""If it is mainly through existing frameworks then it will not get to BAME organisations. There are real concerns.""

"BT Tower in London is a major communications hub Huawei's involvement in the most sensitive parts of EE's mobile network is to continue longer than planned. In December 2018, owner BT said it would take just two years to remove Huawei equipment from its core network. But it now says ""100% of core mobile traffic"" will be on its new Ericsson-built equipment by 2023, the government deadline announced in January 2020. And it blames the government for also ruling 65% of the network's periphery must be rid of Huawei equipment too. Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks Huawei warns UK against 5G U-turn after pandemic Government wins vote after Huawei rebellion A mobile phone network's core is sometimes likened to its heart or brain.

Meanwhile, the network's periphery, its radio access network, includes the base stations and antennas that link individual mobile devices to the core. Read more ""In order to hit these ambitious targets within the timescales laid down by government and to align with their focus on 5G networks, it is now our intention to prioritise migrating our 5G customers to the new Ericsson core, followed by our 4G customers,"" a spokesman said. Meanwhile, the United States continues to pressure officials to ban Huawei outright anddozens of Conservative MPs went against their own party last monthin an attempt to do so. Former International Trade and Defence Secretary Liam Fox MP was one of them.

"The social distancing rules and stay at home messages which aim to stop the spread of coronavirus have changed the way people are living their lives. Those who ignore the regulations have faced condemnation or evenpolice action, but even those who have been abiding by the rules can find themselves experiencing social distancing shaming. Thegovernment guidance,externalis clear - people should only leave home for a very limited number of reasons. These include shopping for basic necessities and to take daily exercise, either alone or with members of your household. Coronavirus: What is social distancing? How to keep two metres apart However, a number of people say they have found themselves the subject of criticism or abuse while taking part in that daily exercise routine. George, 68, from Edinburgh, told how he had stopped to speak to a friend - making sure they kept a ""large"" distance between them - after they happened to meet during his daily walk in The Meadows in Edinburgh. He said: ""Suddenly this woman came up to us shouting that we were too close and produced a measuring tape from her pocket. ""She then began measuring the distance between us."" He said his 6ft tall friend had even lain down on the ground to help demonstrate that they were even further apart than the recommended distance of two metres (almost 6.6ft). ""I was shocked by her behaviour and reaction,"" he said. Jane Hurst said she was shocked when a couple shouted at her child during a walk in Edinburgh. ""My seven-year-old was running one tree ahead of us in Inverleith Park, then jumping out at us and shouting 'boo'. ""A couple walking the other direction called him a 'stupid child' and said he should have been at my side."" Susan Bell, 42, from Morningside, said she had heard people sighing and tutting at her while walking down the road. ""I've also seen others making a big show of disapproval to me by doing an exaggerated jump or body swerve onto the road into oncoming traffic. ""It's too much from some people,"" she said. Lauren Ford said people were jumping to the wrong conclusions when judging other people. She said she saw two young men receiving a ""barrel load of abuse"" from an older man when they ran past him on Cramond Beach. ""They calmly explained that they were flatmates and had been together for the past three weeks and hadn't seen anyone else, but the man still carried on shouting. ""He didn't apologise and carried on saying they were still in the wrong. It wasn't fair at all. ""People are judging so fast, its unreal."" Some people said they had been photographed while out with their families or talking to neighbours from a safe distance. Supermarkets can be another flashpoint. Some have introduced one-way systems in their aisles, as well as markings to indicate where shoppers can queue a safe distance apart. Tara Rankine said her husband was ""tutted and grumbled at"" while shopping in a Tesco in Bathgate. She said: ""I can only assume the man thought my husband was browsing and taking too long and they couldn't get past. ""Unfortunately, we are not in a position where we can grab the first thing on the shelf. We need to check the ingredients on everything because our son has severe food allergies. ""While it's great they were observing social distancing by not pushing past him, it unnecessarily made the shopping trip even more stressful than it needed to be.""

"Burger King has been banned from showing adverts suggesting its Rebel Whopper, which is cooked alongside meat and contains egg, is vegan-friendly. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the chain's claim that the burger is ""100% Whopper, no beef"" could be understood to mean it did not contain animal products. Burger King said it had been ""clear and transparent"" in its marketing. The Vegan Society said it was a ""missed opportunity"". ""We communicated from the outset that the Rebel Whopper is aimed at a flexitarian audience,"" the fast food chain said in a statement.

"The Financial Conduct Authority has ordered insurance companies to pay out claims to firms ""as soon as possible"" or explain themselves to the watchdog. The FCA has told insurers if there are reasonable grounds to pay part of a claim but not the full claim, they must make an interim payment. If not, insurers must tell the FCA how they reached the decision and how it is ""a fair outcome for customers"". The move is aimed at relieving pressure on firms during the Covid-19 lockdown. Coronavirus: 'My business could go bust if insurers don't pay' ""A key objective of the FCA is to ensure that financial pressures on policyholders are not exacerbated by slow payment, rather, such claims should be paid as soon as is possible,"" the FCA's interim chief executive, Christopher Woolard, told insurers in a letter. ""This is consistent with the wider objective of the authorities to support business and consumers during the current crisis."" The letter is targeted at insurers in relation to claims from small and medium firms for business interruption cover and does not address individuals' policies. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said: ""Insurers recognise this is a worrying time for all businesses and ABI members are committed to swift payment of valid claims and interim payments to their customers."" Mr Woolard admitted that following conversations with insurers, it was clear that most business interruption policies held by small and medium-sized businesses only had basic cover which did not include pandemics and therefore insurers had no obligation to pay out in relation to Covid-19. ""While this may be disappointing for the policyholder, we see no reasonable grounds to intervene in such circumstances,"" he said. Simon Ager Some firms have warned they are at risk of collapse due to insurers failing to cover losses as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. Businessman Simon Ager who runs the Pinnacle Climbing Centre in Northampton, is one of a number of business owners who have said they might take legal action against insurers Hiscox, which has said it will not pay business interruption claims resulting from the outbreak. Mr Ager's policy covers the climbing centre for losses of up to Â£100,000 if it is forced to close in certain circumstances, although he says the lockdown is likely to cost him more than that. Hiscox's policy documents says it will cover financial losses for businesses which are unable to use their premises following ""an occurrence of any human infectious or human contagious disease, an outbreak of which must be notified to the local authority"". But Hiscox says the insurance industry does not have enough money to cover all the losses that will emerge as a result of the lockdown. ""Business interruption policies across the industry were never intended to cover pandemic risks,"" a spokeswoman said, noting that the insurer's lawyers do not think the pandemic is covered by its business interruption policies. Instead, the insurer argues that the policy was intended to cover incidents that occur only within a mile of a business - not across the whole country - or outbreaks such as Legionnaires' disease on the premises. Read more here The FCA said that smaller companies, classed as firms with turnover of less than Â£6.5m and fewer than 50 employees, could take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman. Mr Woolard added that the City watchdog had set up a small business unit, responsible for ""gathering intelligence about the treatment of small businesses by financial services firms during the crisis and ensuring a co-ordinated response by the FCA to any issues identified"".

"Gary Crosbie runs a previously successful business, but is struggling to get a loan Gary Crosbie wants to keep his staff on, but like other small firms, his profitable business now faces running out of cash owing to the coronavirus shutdown. Mr Crosbie runs Interefurb, which refurbishes pubs, hotels and restaurants. He says he can demonstrate three years of profits, with Â£50,000 cash in the bank. Yet because his bank decided it didn't wish to support the construction industry, he failed the test that required banks only to lend according to their pre-shutdown criteria. He was rejected for a government-backed loan last week. ""My accountant said, 'You can put off paying your VAT.' But that's up to date. They said, 'Well, you can put off paying national insurance' - but I'd kept that up to date too. So for doing the right thing - I can't get any help,"" he told the BBC. So far, banks and financial institutions have lent more than Â£1.1bn to small and medium-sized enterprises under the government's coronavirus loan scheme, according to figures released by UK Finance on Wednesday. More than 6,000 loans have now been provided, with an average value of about Â£185,000. But the message from small firms and politicians is that loans are being approved too slowly - and that the government must bring in urgent reforms to the scheme to stop businesses going bust. Among the scheme's critics is shadow business secretary Ed Miliband, who says it is ""simply not working well enough"". He added: ""The chancellor must move to a 100% guarantee of loans for smaller businesses as other countries have done. In this economic emergency, it is the right thing to do."" The British Chambers of Commerce said that only 2% of UK firms had so far secured the loans. Businesses are clamouring for help and will be exasperated at the tally of crisis loans that banks have succeeded in giving out. Six thousand is way short of the number of applications and is a tiny fraction of those who face a cash flow crunch. Many bosses have just days. They have to find a way to pay wages at the end of the month. It is true that the rate of lending has accelerated. And the word from within the banking world that four out of five of the loans are being approved. But everyone wants this scheme to work faster and for the money to support wages for furloughed workers to be made available as soon as possible. The Treasury said it was taking ""unprecedented action to support business"". It said that action included Â£330bn in business loans and guarantees, paying 80% of furloughed workers' wages and giving Â£3bn cash grants to a quarter of million small businesses, as well as tax deferrals. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also previously ruled out the taxpayer giving 100% backing for the loan scheme. ""When people say I should take 100% of the risk, it's not really me, it's actually all of us, it's the taxpayer taking 100% of the risk of the loans defaulting,"" he said. Ministers brought in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme with promises that they would do whatever it took to support firms hit by the shutdown. Government-backed loans were to be available to all firms that were solvent and trading when the shutdown began. The Treasury revamped the loans scheme two weeks ago, while banks said they worked through the Easter weekend to boost lending. But some business owners have told the BBC that they have not been able to access loans or grants. Dave Moran's firm had a full order book before the coronavirus lockdown Dave Moran, who previously worked as a senior executive in the pharmaceutical industry, owns UK Challenge, which runs corporate team-building events. For the past two years, it has run at a loss as a start-up company, but was moving into profit this year, with a full order book before the lockdown was imposed. ""Rishi Sunak said, 'Whatever it takes,' and for me, those were good words,"" he said. ""If you'd spoken to me three to four months ago, our 2020 was on course to be a bumper year. Essentially we lost everything overnight. ""We are keeping going. I've not laid off staff - we're still paying full pay. We're in a position where our money will run out."" He was told by his council that the business couldn't get grants because it is a sub-tenant in a building and his bank has not signed up to the scheme. ""You've got the Business Minister, Alok Sharma, and the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, saying, 'We won't let bureaucracy get in the way,' but that's exactly what's happening,"" he said. The National Association of Corporate Finance Brokers (NACFB), whose members arrange finance for thousands of small business clients, said that even after a government overhaul announced two weeks ago, it was still taking far too long to apply. Each application took more than five hours to get through the necessary paperwork, it said. Paul Goodman, chair of the NACFB, said that was far too slow to allow the country's five million small businesses to access cash in time. ""The way it's set up, banks are still having to work out whether or not they would lend to the business if it were normal times,"" he said. ""That means there's nothing for customers who have a perfectly viable business, but can't show all the banks require to get a government-backed loan."" According to the BCC's figures, 17% of businesses had only enough cash to last a month, while 36% had less than three months' cash reserves. MPs on the all-party group for Fair Business Banking say the scheme must be made much simpler and faster to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises from going under. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake warns that without speedier loans, businesses will go bust Kevin Hollinrake, who chairs the group, said: ""We've seen many more loans being approved, which is clearly great news. ""But we need the process to be simpler and faster in terms of getting this money into bank accounts. ""We also need better data on a daily basis to see the numbers of applications being made, the numbers being refused and the numbers being approved. We only have days to get this right."" He said that next week, many small businesses will have to make payroll and supplier payments. ""We need to get this money into business bank accounts this week or we'll see lots of small and medium-sized enterprises start to go bust from next week,"" Mr Hollinrake warned. HM Treasury said: ""The loan scheme is designed to give banks and businesses confidence, and ensure that viable businesses get the support they need. ""We're working closely with banks to ensure we get finance to those who need it as soon as possible and continually look to review our support to see what improvements can be made,"" the spokesperson added.

"The government has given formal approval for construction work on the HS2 rail project to begin despite lockdown measures. Construction firms involved in phase one of the high-speed rail project will need to follow social distancing rules. HS2 minister Andrew Stephenson said: ""We cannot delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson approved the decisionto build the rail link in February after a review into its cost. Matthew Kilcoyne, deputy director of the free-market Adam Smith Institute, called the government's announcement ""tone-deaf"" in the light of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Kilcoyne said: ""We've got an economic crisis that's going to cost taxpayers billions. We can't afford vanity projects like HS2. ""We need to get back on to a sustainable financial footing."" The government's official report previously warned thatthe project could cost more than Â£100bn and be up to five years behind schedule. On Tuesday Chancellor Rishi Sunak warnedthat the coronavirus pandemic ""will have serious implications for the UK economy"". He spoke after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated that a three-month lockdown would hit GDP and push up the UK's borrowing bill to an estimated Â£273bn this financial year. Once built, London to Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour, 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the Department for Transport HS2 minister Andrew Stephenson said: ""This next step provides thousands of construction workers and businesses across the country with certainty at a time when they need it."" A notice to proceed has been given to four joint ventures, which will start work immediately,according to a statement by the Department for Transport (DfT),external. The announcement was welcomed by the boss of the Construction Industry Council, Graham Watts. ""The notice to proceed with HS2 is welcome at this time, particularly for the benefit of the economy,"" he said. ""When the current crisis is over, planned recovery is vital and major infrastructural work such as HS2 and from Highways England, together with a recovery in housebuilding, is a key instrument for kickstarting the wider economy."" Companies with HS2 contracts include Costain, Balfour Beatty and Skanska Construction UK. Mark Thurston, chief executive of HS2 Ltd, said: ""The issuing of notice to proceed today ensures that our contractors and their supply chains have the confidence that they can commit to building HS2, generating thousands of skilled jobs across the country as we recover from the pandemic."" Construction workers on-site will need to observePublic Health England's advice on social distancing,externalduring the Covid-19 outbreak. The GMB union, which represents HS2 construction workers, said that the safety of the workforce ""must be the overriding priority"". Eamon O'Hearn, its national officer, said that construction should be ""conditional on rigorous observation of social distancing, provision of personal protective equipment where required"", as well as individual risk assessments for vulnerable workers. HS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It is hoped the project will reduce passenger overcrowding and help rebalance the UK's economy through investment in transport links outside London. HS2 minister Mr Stephenson added: ""HS2 will be the spine of the country's transport network, boosting capacity and connectivity, while also rebalancing opportunity fairly across our towns and cities.""

"Burger King has been banned from showing adverts suggesting its Rebel Whopper, which is cooked alongside meat and contains egg, is vegan-friendly. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the chain's claim that the burger is ""100% Whopper, no beef"" could be understood to mean it did not contain animal products. Burger King said it had been ""clear and transparent"" in its marketing. The Vegan Society said it was a ""missed opportunity"". ""We communicated from the outset that the Rebel Whopper is aimed at a flexitarian audience,"" the fast food chain said in a statement. But the ASA found that Burger King's social media posts about the Rebel Whopper gave the impression it could be eaten by vegans and vegetarians. Allow Twitter content?

"The 107th edition of the Tour will start in Nice and finish in Paris The postponed 2020 Tour de France will now start on 29 August, following the French government's extension of a ban on mass gatherings to mid-July because of the coronavirus pandemic. Cycling's biggest event,won by Team Ineos' Egan Bernallast year, was originally scheduled to run from 27 June to 19 July. ""Holding this event in the best conditions possible is judged essential given its central place in cycling's economy,"" said the UCI, the sport's governing body. Many large-scale sporting events scheduled to take place this summer have either been called off, such as Wimbledon, or pushed back by a year, such as football's European Championship and the summer Olympics. Four-time winner Chris Froome is set to return at this year's Tour, which is set to start in Nice, after he missed the 2019 race following a high-speed accident in which hebroke his neck, femur, elbow, hip and ribs. He tweeted:,external""The news many of us have been waiting for. Some light at the end of the tunnel."" Geraint Thomas, the Briton who won the Tour de France in 2018, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Hopefully those dates can go ahead. I'm super excited about that. ""The Tour is the pinnacle of the sport. If you ask anyone in the UK for three words to do with cycling, they would be: Tour de France. It would be great for the riders and the teams if it can go ahead. This is why teams exist and that's why sponsorship comes into the sport."" He added: ""The calendar needs to be ironed out. Once we know that we can get back racing again then talks can get under way between everyone. The Tour has to take priority. That's the main event in cycling and then hopefully we can fit other races in around it."" Cycling's two other three-week Grand Tour races have also been rescheduled for later this year, as part of a plan by the UCI to stage all major cycling races this season. The Giro d'Italia - which was scheduled to take place in May - and the Vuelta a Espana, originally set for September, will now be raced after September's World Championships. The championships, which will be held in Switzerland, remain in their 20-27 September slot, which means the Tour de France will finish on the same day the week-long championships begin. That means the men's World Championship road race will take place one week after the final day of the Tour. The postponed 'monument' one-day races - Milan-San Remo, Liege-Bastonge-Liege, Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - ""will all take place this season, at dates still to be defined"", added the statement. The UCI cautioned that the calendar will remain dependant on the ""world health situation"", with the body's president David Lappartient saying ""we still have work to do to finalise the establishment of an entirely revised calendar"". On 10 April, the UCIfurloughed staff and cut the salaries of senior employeesas a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The women's version of the Tour, La Course by le Tour de France, was initially scheduled to take place over one day on 19 July on the Champs Elysees in Paris. But Tour organiser ASO said it will also be postponed and instead take place ""during the Tour de France 2020"". Matt Warwick, BBC Sport As determined as the UCI is, it is hard to see how cycling's governing body is going to fit all these races into this season. It appears officials believe the financial implications for cancelling races in 2020 could be so detrimental - to teams and organisers - that they will instead try to push all major events back as far as they can. But what is realistic in such an unpredictable situation as the coronavirus crisis evolves? Cycling could yet benefit commercially from being one of the few major sports not to call off much of its 2020 schedule until next year. However, if those events - having been moved - are then cancelled at a later date, there must be further financial implications. And there is already much to sort out on the calendar, so when does the UCI think it can fit in a further six weeks of Grand Tour competition and five 'monument' one-day races around October and November, when most of Europe gets seriously cold and wet?

"The social distancing rules and stay at home messages which aim to stop the spread of coronavirus have changed the way people are living their lives. Those who ignore the regulations have faced condemnation or evenpolice action, but even those who have been abiding by the rules can find themselves experiencing social distancing shaming. Thegovernment guidance,externalis clear - people should only leave home for a very limited number of reasons. These include shopping for basic necessities and to take daily exercise, either alone or with members of your household. Coronavirus: What is social distancing? How to keep two metres apart However, a number of people say they have found themselves the subject of criticism or abuse while taking part in that daily exercise routine. George, 68, from Edinburgh, told how he had stopped to speak to a friend - making sure they kept a ""large"" distance between them - after they happened to meet during his daily walk in The Meadows in Edinburgh. He said: ""Suddenly this woman came up to us shouting that we were too close and produced a measuring tape from her pocket. ""She then began measuring the distance between us."" He said his 6ft tall friend had even lain down on the ground to help demonstrate that they were even further apart than the recommended distance of two metres (almost 6.6ft). ""I was shocked by her behaviour and reaction,"" he said. Jane Hurst said she was shocked when a couple shouted at her child during a walk in Edinburgh. ""My seven-year-old was running one tree ahead of us in Inverleith Park, then jumping out at us and shouting 'boo'. ""A couple walking the other direction called him a 'stupid child' and said he should have been at my side."" Susan Bell, 42, from Morningside, said she had heard people sighing and tutting at her while walking down the road. ""I've also seen others making a big show of disapproval to me by doing an exaggerated jump or body swerve onto the road into oncoming traffic. ""It's too much from some people,"" she said. Lauren Ford said people were jumping to the wrong conclusions when judging other people. She said she saw two young men receiving a ""barrel load of abuse"" from an older man when they ran past him on Cramond Beach. ""They calmly explained that they were flatmates and had been together for the past three weeks and hadn't seen anyone else, but the man still carried on shouting. ""He didn't apologise and carried on saying they were still in the wrong. It wasn't fair at all. ""People are judging so fast, its unreal."" Some people said they had been photographed while out with their families or talking to neighbours from a safe distance. Supermarkets can be another flashpoint. Some have introduced one-way systems in their aisles, as well as markings to indicate where shoppers can queue a safe distance apart. Tara Rankine said her husband was ""tutted and grumbled at"" while shopping in a Tesco in Bathgate. She said: ""I can only assume the man thought my husband was browsing and taking too long and they couldn't get past. ""Unfortunately, we are not in a position where we can grab the first thing on the shelf. We need to check the ingredients on everything because our son has severe food allergies. ""While it's great they were observing social distancing by not pushing past him, it unnecessarily made the shopping trip even more stressful than it needed to be.""

"Vaughan Gething said data was processed at ""remarkable speed"" Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said he is sorry that 13,000 letters for people most vulnerable to coronavirus were mistakenly sent to the wrong addresses. More than 80,000 people are meant to get a ""shielding letter"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) says it is looking into the data breach, after the Welsh NHS referred itself to the regulator. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""potentially disastrous mistake"". Mr Gething said the letters had now been re-sent ""so people should receive them within the next day or two"". The ICO, which can fine organisations for not protecting private information, said it would bear in mind the current crisis in its response. Live: Latest updates on coronavirus in Wales Minister vows to boost virus tests by 'next week' BBC Wales has been told local government minister Julie James briefed council leaders about the error on Friday. The letters from the chief medical officer, which should have been delivered by 3 April, are for those with serious underlying health conditions and advise people to stay at home for 12 weeks. They contain information and advice, including how those who have no-one else to support them can get medication and other essential items like food. Those eligible for the letter qualify for priority delivery slots from supermarkets, although there have been delays introducing that system here. The Welsh Government said local authorities and supermarkets had been provided with the correct addresses from the outset, with the latter using these for delivery slots. Delyth Jewell: ""There is still time to step back from the brink"" On Wednesday, Mr Gething toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Oliver Hidesthe data had been processed at ""remarkable speed"". ""In one copy of that data the previous address was used rather than the current one,"" he said. ""I am sorry the error happened, and I know that there were people who will be worried about it. ""But all those letters have now gone out so people should receive them within the next day or two."" Plaid Cymru's local government spokeswoman Delyth Jewell said: ""This is a potentially disastrous mistake which could needlessly endanger lives."" She called for details of ""what went wrong for this to happen in the first place"". Paul Davies, who leads the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay, said the error was ""just unacceptable"". ""How on earth did 13,000 letters out of a total of 80,000 go to the wrong addresses?"" hetweeted,external. ""We should not see a mistake like this on such a massive scale."" Earlier, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""Due to a processing error within the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), some shielding letters were posted to a previous address, where the intended recipient had recently moved. ""All letters have since been reissued to the correct addresses. ""We provided all local authorities with the correct details from the start of this process, and they have been directly contacting each person involved over the past two weeks."" She added: ""We fully understand the concern this would have caused people and sincerely apologise for the mistake."" An ICO spokesperson said: ""NHS Wales Informatics Services has reported a data breach to us and we will be making enquiries. ""People have a right to expect their personal information be protected.

"Protective gowns and masks could be reused by health workers under ""last resort"" coronavirus plans revealed in a leaked Public Health England document. Emails seen by the BBC also showed that some hospitals have begun laundering single-use gowns to preserve stocks. The British Medical Association said this ""underlines the urgency"" of protective equipment shortages. Public Health England said the safe reuse of items was being considered. However, it said no decisions had been made. A document seen by the BBC has revealed new details of plans to tackle shortages of personal protective equipment, known as PPE. It is understood that the chief medical officers and chief nurses of the four UK nations recently discussed the issue. Following the meeting, a draft document written by Public Health England and dated 13 April suggested solutions for ""acute supply shortages"" of PPE. ""These are last-resort alternatives, but given the current in-country stock and the reduced ability to re-supply, we are suggesting that these are implemented until confirmation of adequate re-supply is in place"", it said. The plans suggested a series of ""last-resort arrangements"", including: Buying ""building"" or ""sportswear"" eye protection with extensions to cover the side of the eyes if there are no available goggles or face shields Using washable laboratory coats and patients' gowns where there are no available disposable gowns or coveralls Re-purposing face masks using various disinfection or sterilisation methods, including steam and UV disinfection The document said some of the last-resort measures would need to be reviewed and approved by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of vaporised hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate certain masks. It is understood that the infection and prevention and control team at NHS England believe the Health and Safety Executive should be responsible for reviewing the guidance in this area.

Emails seen by the BBC also showed some hospitals have trialled and begun reusing single-use, fluid repellent gowns that they have laundered. Discussions are understood to be taking place about whether to ask local launderettes to re-open to process the cleaning of gowns. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association, said: ""This underlines the urgency with which we need this situation sorted. ""The government must be honest about PPE supplies. ""If [Public Heath England] is proposing the reuse of equipment, it needs to be demonstrably driven by science and the best evidence in keeping with international standards, rather than by availability, and with absolutely no compromise to the protection of healthcare workers."" In a statement, Dr Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, said: ""PPE is a precious resource and it is crucial that everyone in health and social care has access to the right protective equipment. ""All options are being considered to ensure this, including the safe reuse of items, but no decisions have been made."" The HSE said it was right that, where possible, ""strategies for optimising the supply of PPE should be explored"". ""We are discussing with Public Health England ways in which pressure can be eased on the supply chain. This includes potentially reusing certain equipment where it is safe to do so,"" it said.

"Gary Crosbie runs a previously successful business, but is struggling to get a loan Gary Crosbie wants to keep his staff on, but like other small firms, his profitable business now faces running out of cash owing to the coronavirus shutdown. Mr Crosbie runs Interefurb, which refurbishes pubs, hotels and restaurants. He says he can demonstrate three years of profits, with Â£50,000 cash in the bank. Yet because his bank decided it didn't wish to support the construction industry, he failed the test that required banks only to lend according to their pre-shutdown criteria. He was rejected for a government-backed loan last week. ""My accountant said, 'You can put off paying your VAT.' But that's up to date. They said, 'Well, you can put off paying national insurance' - but I'd kept that up to date too. So for doing the right thing - I can't get any help,"" he told the BBC. So far, banks and financial institutions have lent more than Â£1.1bn to small and medium-sized enterprises under the government's coronavirus loan scheme, according to figures released by UK Finance on Wednesday. More than 6,000 loans have now been provided, with an average value of about Â£185,000. But the message from small firms and politicians is that loans are being approved too slowly - and that the government must bring in urgent reforms to the scheme to stop businesses going bust. Among the scheme's critics is shadow business secretary Ed Miliband, who says it is ""simply not working well enough"". He added: ""The chancellor must move to a 100% guarantee of loans for smaller businesses as other countries have done. In this economic emergency, it is the right thing to do."" The British Chambers of Commerce said that only 2% of UK firms had so far secured the loans. Businesses are clamouring for help and will be exasperated at the tally of crisis loans that banks have succeeded in giving out. Six thousand is way short of the number of applications and is a tiny fraction of those who face a cash flow crunch. Many bosses have just days. They have to find a way to pay wages at the end of the month. It is true that the rate of lending has accelerated. And the word from within the banking world that four out of five of the loans are being approved. But everyone wants this scheme to work faster and for the money to support wages for furloughed workers to be made available as soon as possible. The Treasury said it was taking ""unprecedented action to support business"". It said that action included Â£330bn in business loans and guarantees, paying 80% of furloughed workers' wages and giving Â£3bn cash grants to a quarter of million small businesses, as well as tax deferrals. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also previously ruled out the taxpayer giving 100% backing for the loan scheme. ""When people say I should take 100% of the risk, it's not really me, it's actually all of us, it's the taxpayer taking 100% of the risk of the loans defaulting,"" he said. Ministers brought in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme with promises that they would do whatever it took to support firms hit by the shutdown. Government-backed loans were to be available to all firms that were solvent and trading when the shutdown began. The Treasury revamped the loans scheme two weeks ago, while banks said they worked through the Easter weekend to boost lending. But some business owners have told the BBC that they have not been able to access loans or grants. Dave Moran's firm had a full order book before the coronavirus lockdown Dave Moran, who previously worked as a senior executive in the pharmaceutical industry, owns UK Challenge, which runs corporate team-building events. For the past two years, it has run at a loss as a start-up company, but was moving into profit this year, with a full order book before the lockdown was imposed. ""Rishi Sunak said, 'Whatever it takes,' and for me, those were good words,"" he said. ""If you'd spoken to me three to four months ago, our 2020 was on course to be a bumper year. Essentially we lost everything overnight. ""We are keeping going. I've not laid off staff - we're still paying full pay. We're in a position where our money will run out."" He was told by his council that the business couldn't get grants because it is a sub-tenant in a building and his bank has not signed up to the scheme. ""You've got the Business Minister, Alok Sharma, and the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, saying, 'We won't let bureaucracy get in the way,' but that's exactly what's happening,"" he said. The National Association of Corporate Finance Brokers (NACFB), whose members arrange finance for thousands of small business clients, said that even after a government overhaul announced two weeks ago, it was still taking far too long to apply. Each application took more than five hours to get through the necessary paperwork, it said. Paul Goodman, chair of the NACFB, said that was far too slow to allow the country's five million small businesses to access cash in time. ""The way it's set up, banks are still having to work out whether or not they would lend to the business if it were normal times,"" he said. ""That means there's nothing for customers who have a perfectly viable business, but can't show all the banks require to get a government-backed loan."" According to the BCC's figures, 17% of businesses had only enough cash to last a month, while 36% had less than three months' cash reserves. MPs on the all-party group for Fair Business Banking say the scheme must be made much simpler and faster to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises from going under. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake warns that without speedier loans, businesses will go bust Kevin Hollinrake, who chairs the group, said: ""We've seen many more loans being approved, which is clearly great news. ""But we need the process to be simpler and faster in terms of getting this money into bank accounts. ""We also need better data on a daily basis to see the numbers of applications being made, the numbers being refused and the numbers being approved. We only have days to get this right."" He said that next week, many small businesses will have to make payroll and supplier payments. ""We need to get this money into business bank accounts this week or we'll see lots of small and medium-sized enterprises start to go bust from next week,"" Mr Hollinrake warned. HM Treasury said: ""The loan scheme is designed to give banks and businesses confidence, and ensure that viable businesses get the support they need. ""We're working closely with banks to ensure we get finance to those who need it as soon as possible and continually look to review our support to see what improvements can be made,"" the spokesperson added.

"Vaughan Gething said data was processed at ""remarkable speed"" Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething has said he is sorry that 13,000 letters for people most vulnerable to coronavirus were mistakenly sent to the wrong addresses. More than 80,000 people are meant to get a ""shielding letter"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) says it is looking into the data breach, after the Welsh NHS referred itself to the regulator. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""potentially disastrous mistake"". Mr Gething said the letters had now been re-sent ""so people should receive them within the next day or two"". The ICO, which can fine organisations for not protecting private information, said it would bear in mind the current crisis in its response. Live: Latest updates on coronavirus in Wales Minister vows to boost virus tests by 'next week' BBC Wales has been told local government minister Julie James briefed council leaders about the error on Friday. The letters from the chief medical officer, which should have been delivered by 3 April, are for those with serious underlying health conditions and advise people to stay at home for 12 weeks. They contain information and advice, including how those who have no-one else to support them can get medication and other essential items like food. Those eligible for the letter qualify for priority delivery slots from supermarkets, although there have been delays introducing that system here. The Welsh Government said local authorities and supermarkets had been provided with the correct addresses from the outset, with the latter using these for delivery slots. Delyth Jewell: ""There is still time to step back from the brink"" On Wednesday, Mr Gething toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Oliver Hidesthe data had been processed at ""remarkable speed"". ""In one copy of that data the previous address was used rather than the current one,"" he said. ""I am sorry the error happened, and I know that there were people who will be worried about it. ""But all those letters have now gone out so people should receive them within the next day or two."" Plaid Cymru's local government spokeswoman Delyth Jewell said: ""This is a potentially disastrous mistake which could needlessly endanger lives."" She called for details of ""what went wrong for this to happen in the first place"". Paul Davies, who leads the Conservative group in Cardiff Bay, said the error was ""just unacceptable"". ""How on earth did 13,000 letters out of a total of 80,000 go to the wrong addresses?"" hetweeted,external. ""We should not see a mistake like this on such a massive scale."" Earlier, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""Due to a processing error within the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS), some shielding letters were posted to a previous address, where the intended recipient had recently moved. ""All letters have since been reissued to the correct addresses. ""We provided all local authorities with the correct details from the start of this process, and they have been directly contacting each person involved over the past two weeks."" She added: ""We fully understand the concern this would have caused people and sincerely apologise for the mistake."" An ICO spokesperson said: ""NHS Wales Informatics Services has reported a data breach to us and we will be making enquiries. ""People have a right to expect their personal information be protected.

"This video can not be played Trump said the WHO had ""failed in its basic duty"" US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He accused the UN agency of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China, and said it must be held accountable. In response, the UN's chief said it was ""not the time"" to cut funds to the WHO. Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China. He has accused the WHO of having ""criticised"" that decision and of being biased towards China more generally. Follow live coronavirus updates ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday. The WHO has often praised China for its handling of the outbreak The US is the global health body's largest single funder and gave it more than $400m in 2019. A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days. The WHO is yet to directly respond but UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the international community should be uniting ""in solidarity to stop this virus"". ""It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" he said. Germany's foreign minister tweeted that strengthening the ""under-funded"" WHO was one of the best investments that could be made at this time.

The US has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths worldwide- with more than 600,000 cases and 26,000 deaths. Mr Trump accused the WHO of having failed to adequately assess the outbreak when it first emerged in the city of Wuhan. ""Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,"" he told reporters. ""This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value... and defended the actions of the Chinese government."" Chinese officials initially covered up the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan,and punished whistleblowers who tried to raise the alarm. Beijing later imposed draconian restrictions, including quarantine zones on an unprecedented scale, drawing effusive praise from the WHO and its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. WHO experts were only allowed to visit China and investigate the outbreak on 10 February, by which time the country had more than 40,000 cases. White House reporters pointed out, however, that Mr Trump himself praised China's response to the outbreak and downplayed the danger of the virus at home long after the WHO had declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"".

Democrats accused him of trying to shift blame away from himself in an election year, but many Republicans in Congress praised his decision to cut funding. It is not the first time the WHO's response to the outbreak has come under scrutiny. On 14 January,the organisation tweeted,externalthat preliminary Chinese investigations had found ""no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" of the new virus. Mr Trump and others have used the tweet to attack the WHO for simply believing China, despite evidence to the contrary. But about a week after that tweet, on 22 January,the agency released a public statement saying that human-to-human transmission did appear to be taking place in Wuhan.,external At the end of January, on the same day it declared a public health emergency, the WHO said that travel restrictions were not needed to stop the spread of Covid-19 -advice that was eventually ignored by most countries,external, including by the Trump administration the next day. The man leading the fight against the coronavirus In March, the UN agency was also accused of being unduly influenced by China aftera senior official refused to discuss Taiwan's responseto the outbreak. Meanwhile, some health experts also say thatthe WHO's guidance on face masks has led to public confusion,external. Other frequently-made criticisms of the WHO more generally are that it is constrained by politics and a sprawling bureaucracy. It came under particular fire for its response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and how long it took to declare a public health emergency,leading the organisation to announce reforms in response,external. At one level, this move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China. They say the WHO was too ready to support China's deceptive early claims about the virus and then didn't push hard enough against Beijing's attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHO's criticism of his travel restrictions against China. But at another level, the move to defund the WHO is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail China's growing global influence. The argument is that Chinese leadership in international organisations undermines the rules-based, accountable international system needed to prevent and fight a pandemic.

"This video can not be played Virus vaccine research 'enormously accelerated' GSK and Sanofi, two of the world's biggest pharmaceutical giants, are joining forces to try and create a vaccine to stop the spread of Covid-19. The bad news is that the vaccine - even if it is successful - will not be ready till the second half of next year. GSK's chief executive Emma Walmsley told the BBC that vaccines usually take a decade to develop and test. A plan to make a vaccine available in just 18 months was a huge acceleration of the normal process, she said. GSK is also involved in a tie-up with the UK's other pharma giant AstraZeneca to help the government hit its target of conducting 100,000 tests by the end of April. Emma Walmsley said she hoped that the UK's two biggest pharmaceutical companies could help provide 30,000 daily tests by the beginning of May. A substantial contribution but leaving some way to go to hit the target. GSK also said it would channel any profits made from its vaccine programme into increased research and development into future virus threats. When asked whether it was appropriate for any company to profit from a global emergency Emma Walmsley promised that the company would not show any net profit from vaccine sales and along with future research investment, GSK would use any profits to subsidise vaccine deliveries to developing countries. Are we getting closer to a coronavirus vaccine or drug? Other groups have promised faster vaccine results. Sarah Gilbert, an Oxford University professor engaged in a separate search for a vaccine, said she was ""80 per cent confident"" her team's development would work by autumn. There are more than 20 vaccines currently in development. Among those under way at the moment are: The first human trial for a vaccine was announced last month by scientists at a lab in the US city of Seattle. They have taken the unusual step of skipping any animal research to test the vaccine's safety or effectiveness. Australian scientists have begun injecting ferrets with two potential vaccines. It is the first comprehensive pre-clinical trial to move to the animal testing stage, and the researchers say they hope to move to the human testing stage by the end of April.

"All care home residents and staff with Covid-19 symptoms will be tested for coronavirus as laboratory capacity increases, the government has promised. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""determined"" to ensure everyone who needed a test had access to one. Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, welcomed the pledge but predicted ""logistical challenges"". It comes as a further 761 hospital deaths were announced in the UK, bringing the total to 12,868. Care providers been calling for more testing for weeks, amid outbreaks at more than 2,000 homes. At the moment only the first five residents who show symptoms in a care home are tested, to determine whether there is an outbreak of the virus. Providers have also complained that deaths among residents were being""airbrushed"" out of official figuresand demanded greater support for the industry. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer isurging the government to publish an exit strategyfrom the coronavirus lockdown. Sir Keir said his party would support the government if, as expected, it extends lockdown measures later this week. But he called for more transparency about how and when the rules will be relaxed. Testing and why it matters Care homes cause concern for families Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures On Wednesday, 651 new deaths were announced in England, 84 in Scotland,60 in Walesand six in Northern Ireland. The totals can differ fromthe number reported by the Department of Health and Social Care,externalfor the whole of the UK, as they are based on different reporting periods. BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said only Scotland and Wales had seen a post-weekend spike in deaths due to delays in reporting caused by the Easter weekend, giving hope that the daily death toll had stopped rising. ""The overall picture for the UK is almost a week with no growth in the number of deaths announced every day. This adds to the evidence that the lockdown has stopped the growth of the coronavirus,"" he said. But he added that more data was needed to know for sure, and the high number of deaths remained a shocking and sad feature of daily life. In theory, increasing the amount of testing in care homes will be certainly possible as capacity increases. Over the next 10 days, extra facilities from commercial partners are expected to become available. The most tests carried out in one day is 18,000. Doing around 50,000 a day certainly looks possible in the coming weeks, but the 100,000 a day pledged by the government will be a stretch. Logistically, delivering the testing will remain challenging. More than 400,000 frail and vulnerable people are spread across more than 15,000 locations in England alone. Compare that to around 200 hospitals and it is easy to see how difficult it will be to get out to homes to carry out the tests and then process them quickly enough. Government officials have always recognised care homes will be the weakest link in the chain of protection they have tried to wrap around the British public. The nature of care home residents, many of whom struggle with dementia, means it can be difficult for them to follow social distancing and good hand hygiene guidance. They rely on care home staff for intimate personal care, putting both staff and residents at risk as soon as the virus gets into a home. Now the virus is circulating in care homes, slowing the spread and saving lives is going to be incredibly difficult. Every year around 150,000 care home residents die - the fear now is that the number could increase dramatically. All these sets of figures are only for deaths in hospital. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, which includes every community death linked to Covid-19 in England and Wales, showed 406 such deaths registered up to 3 April had occurred outside of hospitals - 217 of them in care homes. The number is expected to have increased since then. In Scotland, there have been 237 deaths in care homes with coronavirus mentioned on the death certificate,according to figures released on Wednesday. Britain's largest care home operator, HC-One, said the virus represented about one-third of all deaths at HC-One's care homes over the last three weeks. And MHA, a charity which operates 131 homes, said it had recorded 210 coronavirus-related deaths to date. Claire Rencher, manager of Veronica House Nursing Home in Tipton, in the West Midlands, told the BBC that some residents had gone to A&E and come back without being tested. She said she did not feel the home was getting the support it needed from government, while staff said they felt ""vulnerable"", especially due to the lack of PPE. How big is the problem in care homes? Eight coronavirus deaths at Merseyside care home We can cope with virus peak, hospital bosses say Mr Hancock said he would ensure anyone in a care home with symptoms of the virus, as well as any new care home residents being discharged from hospital into care, would be tested. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is co-ordinating the effort and will offer tests to the UK's 30,000 care providers by the end of the week, the Department for Health and Social Care said. Gail Grant is worried about the virus reaching Ian's care home Gail Grant, from Swindon in Wiltshire,has not been able to visit her husband Ian for three weeks. Ian, a former dentist, has dementia and lives in a care home in Marlborough, some 12 miles away. He turned 70 this month. ""Because of his cognitive level, we can't Skype or talk on the phone. He doesn't have any understanding of the situation and doesn't really know us anymore. But it's more me - I'm aware I'm not going to see him,"" Dr Grant says. ""They say they don't have any cases at the moment at his home. But I think it's a matter of time. And when any carers go down with it, it will be a difficult situation."" She says of the official figures currently just including hospital deaths: ""What right do they have to withhold information that should be in the public domain?"" Prof Green said the roll-out poses a ""major challenge"" and stressed the need to make sure there are enough tests, and to work out how to carry out tests in care homes while keeping residents safe. He said the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) has ""started to improve"" but that there has been ""conflicting guidance"" about how it is used. Social care minister Helen Whately told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had delivered more than 7 million facemasks to care providers, set up an emergency supply line to contact for PPE, and distributed stocks to local resilience forums.

"This video can not be played Chancellor: Coronavirus will have ""very significant impact"" on economy A forecast by the UK's tax and spending watchdog suggests the coronavirus crisis will have ""serious implications"" for the UK economy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned the pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak stressed that the forecast was only one possible scenario. But he said it was important that the government was ""honest with people about what may be happening"". He said the OBR figures suggest that the scale of what the UK is facing ""will have serious implications for our economy"", in common with other countries. ""These are tough times, and there will be more to come,"" Mr Sunak said. However, he said that while the government could not protect every business and household, ""we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses."" The OBR also expects the economic impact of the crisis to be temporary, he said. He added that the government is ""not just going to stand by"" and not act to support the economy. ""Our planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities, and households,"" he said. ""Our plan is the right plan."" Mr Sunak added that at the moment ""the single most important thing we can do to protect the economy is to protect the health of our people."" The OBR said a three-month lockdown followed by three months of partial restrictions would trigger an economic decline of 35.1% in the quarter to June alone, following growth of 0.2% in the first three months of this year. Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said a drop of this magnitude would be the largest ""in living memory"". While the UK economy would contract by 12.8% this year under this scenario, it is expected to get back to its pre-crisis growth trend by the end of 2020. The OBR stressed the actual amount of growth would depend on how long the lockdown lasted, as well as how quickly activity bounced back once restrictions were relaxed. In any case, it expects half of any sharp drop in growth in the second quarter to be reversed in the three months to September as the economy starts to recover. Separately, theInternational Monetary Fund warned the viruswould push the UK into its deepest slump for a century. In its report, the IMF said it expects the UK economy to shrink by 6.5% in 2020, while the global economy will contract by 3%. Sturgeon concerned over England PPE priority claim One in five deaths now linked to coronavirus UK firms at risk of making 'permanent' job cuts Coronavirus-related deaths in UK hospitals have risen to 12,107, an increase of 778 on Monday's total. And more than one in five deaths in England and Wales islinked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics data showed the virus was mentioned on 3,475 death certificates in the week ending 3 April. It helped push the total number of deaths in that week to more than 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than expected at this time of year. The OBR's estimates said a three month lockdown would push up the UK's borrowing bill to an estimated Â£273bn this financial year, or 14% of gross domestic product (GDP). This would represent the largest deficit as a share of GDP since World War Two. While borrowing is expected to jump, the OBR said the government's unprecedented financial help for workers and businesses would help to limit any long-term damage. The OBR expects a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise by 2.1 million to 3.4 million by the end of June. Under this scenario, unemployment would hit 10%, from its current 3.9% rate, before easing to around 7.3% at the end of the year. The jobless rate is expected to remain elevated until 2023, when it is expected to drop back to 4%, in line with the OBR's March forecast. These are incredible numbers indicated by the government's official, though independent, forecasters at the OBR. They illustrate what is at stake, and why the government has to get its economic rescue plans spot on. They will feature at the COBR discussions. Indeed some senior public health experts believe that the government needs an economic counterpart to the influential SAGE committee of scientists. But this isn't quite about a direct trade off. That existed clearly on the way in - the economy was shut down to protect public health. On the way out of these measures, the balance is not straightforward. If the lockdown is lifted prematurely, the health system could fall over, workers might just refuse to go to work anyway, and none of that would be positive for the economy. Indeed when it is lifted, the absence of a vaccine means that these trade offs are likely to be considered week by week and sector by sector, for months to come. The OBR expects UK debt to be higher for years to come, with extra borrowing expected to push Britain's debt share to above 100% of GDP this financial year if the lockdown lasts for three months. While this will drop sharply as the UK economy recovers, public debt is expected to remain at 84.9% of GDP in four years time, much higher than the 75.3% forecast in the March Budget. Mr Chote said a longer lockdown could have more serious consequences for the economy. He said: ""The longer the lockdown goes on, the more likely it is that the future potential of the economy is scarred by business failures, by less business investment and by the unemployed finding it harder to get back into the labour market."" However, the OBR stressed that the restrictions were necessary to protect the economy from a more prolonged slowdown. It said extra spending by the Treasury to support the economy would also limit the economic damage. ""The government's policy response will have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances - the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher,"" the OBR said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area It added that while the lockdown was the main constraint on economic activity, relaxing these measures too soon would cause greater damage. ""The reason why most of the short-term economic impact comes from these measures is that they are successful in limiting the spread of the disease. ""If the measures were not stringent enough to control the disease, then the economic impact from illness would be that much greater.""

"More than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, figures show. The Office for National Statistics said in the week ending 3 April the virus was cited on 3,475 death certificates. It pushed the total number of deaths in that week to over 16,000 - a record high and 6,000 more than normal at this time of year when deaths tend to fall. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rushi Sunak acknowledged there were ""tough times"" ahead economically. It comes as the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK's tax and spending watchdog, warned the pandemiccould see the economy shrink by a record 35% by June. Mr Sunak told No 10's daily coronavirus briefing that it was ""clear"" the situation could be ""much worse"" without the action taken so far. Live page: Care homes 'not forgotten' Which regions have been worst hit by coronavirus? Families fear for loved ones in care homes But he admitted the government could not ""protect every business or household"" as it was clear coronavirus would have ""serious implications"". And he said the economy would bounce back, adding the ""single most important thing is to protect health of everyone"". The ONS report looked at the impact the numbers of people dying with coronavirus alongside all other deaths. Normally at this time of year deaths drop because there is less flu circulating than there is in winter. But instead it jumped up by to a record level of 16,000, the highest number seen since the ONS started publishing data in 2005, topping the biggest weekly toll during the 2015 flu outbreak. ONS official Nick Stripe said it was clear the coronavirus pandemic had reversed that trend, saying the rising number of deaths was ""hugely significant"". ""This is not normal,"" he added. But what is not clear is what else is contributing to this spike in deaths - the coronavirus cases contributed just over half of the ""extra"" 6,000 deaths. It could be that cases of coronavirus are going undetected or other factors related to the lockdown and outbreak are having an impact, such as people not seeking treatment for other conditions or mental health deaths going up. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, an expert in risk at the University of Cambridge, said this needed investigating. But he said he had ""never been as shocked"" as when he saw the scale of the increase in deaths. ""I was upset. It is incredibly vivid. These are people,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The ONS data lags behind the daily death figures reported by the government. This is because it relies on death certificates, which are only often registered some days after the death, whereas the government figures are compiled from confirmed cases of deaths of patients who have tested positive for coronavirus, which can be gathered more quickly. The government figures released on Tuesday revealed there had been another 778 deaths, bringing the total to 12,107 by 17:00 BST on Monday. Another 5,252 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 94,000 by 09:00 BST on Tuesday. Edna Summerfield, 94, died earlier this month after testing positive for coronavirus. Her family believes she contracted it at her care home in Birmingham before she went into hospital on 7 April. Her daughter-in-law Sylvia Summerfield said she feels people in care homes are being neglected - and called for PPE for care home staff as a matter of urgency. ""How many more elderly have got to die in care homes, infected by staff who don't know they have the virus?"" she said. ""It is a very difficult time for us and I feel like people in care homes are being neglected. ""My mother in law didn't deserve the death she had. All the other residents are vulnerable in that care home now."" The fact the government figures rely on deaths where a patient has tested positive - and in England and Northern Ireland this only covers hospital patients - has led to suggestions there has been an under-reporting of deaths in care homes and other community settings. The ONS data does look at deaths elsewhere and shows that one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community - half, just over 200, have been in care homes. But care sector leaders are warning the true toll in care homes is much greater. Age UK says the virus is ""running wild"" in care homes with Care England, the umbrella body for care homes, estimating there have been nearly 1,000 deaths. Elderly being 'airbrushed' out of virus figures If the reports are right it could be that there has been a spike in deaths over the past fortnight or that death certificates are not picking up all the cases. The government confirmed there had been coronavirus outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England - although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. This video can not be played ""The carers knew the little things about mum that were important to her"" says Karin Pointon Industry leaders from Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer's Society called for a daily update on the situation. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said. About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers. Mr Sunak told Tuesday's briefing that care home residents and workers had ""absolutely not been forgotten"". Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle added that health bodies were aiming to have figures on coronavirus-related deaths in care homes published daily. ""In these very dispersed systems we just need to be absolutely clear that the cause of death that is attributed is correct, and that is what takes time on the death certificate to get right,"" she said.

"Gary Crosbie runs a previously successful business, but is struggling to get a loan Gary Crosbie wants to keep his staff on, but like other small firms, his profitable business now faces running out of cash owing to the coronavirus shutdown. Mr Crosbie runs Interefurb, which refurbishes pubs, hotels and restaurants. He says he can demonstrate three years of profits, with Â£50,000 cash in the bank. Yet because his bank decided it didn't wish to support the construction industry, he failed the test that required banks only to lend according to their pre-shutdown criteria. He was rejected for a government-backed loan last week. ""My accountant said, 'You can put off paying your VAT.' But that's up to date. They said, 'Well, you can put off paying national insurance' - but I'd kept that up to date too. So for doing the right thing - I can't get any help,"" he told the BBC. So far, banks and financial institutions have lent more than Â£1.1bn to small and medium-sized enterprises under the government's coronavirus loan scheme, according to figures released by UK Finance on Wednesday. More than 6,000 loans have now been provided, with an average value of about Â£185,000. But the message from small firms and politicians is that loans are being approved too slowly - and that the government must bring in urgent reforms to the scheme to stop businesses going bust. Among the scheme's critics is shadow business secretary Ed Miliband, who says it is ""simply not working well enough"". He added: ""The chancellor must move to a 100% guarantee of loans for smaller businesses as other countries have done. In this economic emergency, it is the right thing to do."" The British Chambers of Commerce said that only 2% of UK firms had so far secured the loans. Businesses are clamouring for help and will be exasperated at the tally of crisis loans that banks have succeeded in giving out. Six thousand is way short of the number of applications and is a tiny fraction of those who face a cash flow crunch. Many bosses have just days. They have to find a way to pay wages at the end of the month. It is true that the rate of lending has accelerated. And the word from within the banking world that four out of five of the loans are being approved. But everyone wants this scheme to work faster and for the money to support wages for furloughed workers to be made available as soon as possible. The Treasury said it was taking ""unprecedented action to support business"". It said that action included Â£330bn in business loans and guarantees, paying 80% of furloughed workers' wages and giving Â£3bn cash grants to a quarter of million small businesses, as well as tax deferrals. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also previously ruled out the taxpayer giving 100% backing for the loan scheme. ""When people say I should take 100% of the risk, it's not really me, it's actually all of us, it's the taxpayer taking 100% of the risk of the loans defaulting,"" he said. Ministers brought in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme with promises that they would do whatever it took to support firms hit by the shutdown. Government-backed loans were to be available to all firms that were solvent and trading when the shutdown began. The Treasury revamped the loans scheme two weeks ago, while banks said they worked through the Easter weekend to boost lending. But some business owners have told the BBC that they have not been able to access loans or grants. Dave Moran's firm had a full order book before the coronavirus lockdown Dave Moran, who previously worked as a senior executive in the pharmaceutical industry, owns UK Challenge, which runs corporate team-building events. For the past two years, it has run at a loss as a start-up company, but was moving into profit this year, with a full order book before the lockdown was imposed. ""Rishi Sunak said, 'Whatever it takes,' and for me, those were good words,"" he said. ""If you'd spoken to me three to four months ago, our 2020 was on course to be a bumper year. Essentially we lost everything overnight. ""We are keeping going. I've not laid off staff - we're still paying full pay. We're in a position where our money will run out."" He was told by his council that the business couldn't get grants because it is a sub-tenant in a building and his bank has not signed up to the scheme. ""You've got the Business Minister, Alok Sharma, and the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, saying, 'We won't let bureaucracy get in the way,' but that's exactly what's happening,"" he said. The National Association of Corporate Finance Brokers (NACFB), whose members arrange finance for thousands of small business clients, said that even after a government overhaul announced two weeks ago, it was still taking far too long to apply. Each application took more than five hours to get through the necessary paperwork, it said. Paul Goodman, chair of the NACFB, said that was far too slow to allow the country's five million small businesses to access cash in time. ""The way it's set up, banks are still having to work out whether or not they would lend to the business if it were normal times,"" he said. ""That means there's nothing for customers who have a perfectly viable business, but can't show all the banks require to get a government-backed loan."" According to the BCC's figures, 17% of businesses had only enough cash to last a month, while 36% had less than three months' cash reserves. MPs on the all-party group for Fair Business Banking say the scheme must be made much simpler and faster to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises from going under. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake warns that without speedier loans, businesses will go bust Kevin Hollinrake, who chairs the group, said: ""We've seen many more loans being approved, which is clearly great news. ""But we need the process to be simpler and faster in terms of getting this money into bank accounts. ""We also need better data on a daily basis to see the numbers of applications being made, the numbers being refused and the numbers being approved. We only have days to get this right."" He said that next week, many small businesses will have to make payroll and supplier payments. ""We need to get this money into business bank accounts this week or we'll see lots of small and medium-sized enterprises start to go bust from next week,"" Mr Hollinrake warned. HM Treasury said: ""The loan scheme is designed to give banks and businesses confidence, and ensure that viable businesses get the support they need. ""We're working closely with banks to ensure we get finance to those who need it as soon as possible and continually look to review our support to see what improvements can be made,"" the spokesperson added.

"President Trump directed his administration to halt US funding to the World Health Organization Trump said US could reopen before 1 May, and in a change of tone accepted governors will make decision Confirmed cases in France passed 100,000, a day after the country extended its lockdown to 11 May Italy saw the smallest daily rise in new infections for more than a month, but its daily death toll remained high Worldwide, nearly 2 million people have been confirmed to have the virus UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said work is under way to get accurate daily data about deaths in UK care homes NHS England medical director says the number of people in hospital with the virus is âplateauingâ Edited by Jude Sheerin Doctors, nurses, surgeons and other NHS and healthcare workers have died with coronavirus. Here are their stories. After that White House briefing from the president, weâre pausing our live page coverage for the time being. If youâve been following our updates, thanks for joining us. To recap, here are some of the dayâs key developments:  Our teams in Asia will be back with you soon, bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic from the US and across the world. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington At one level, Trump's move is about the coronavirus. Administration officials have been sharply accusing the WHO of missteps in the handling of the pandemic, saying it was biased towards China. They say the WHO was too ready to support Chinaâs deceptive early claims about the virus and then didnât push hard enough against Beijingâs attempts to cover up its misinformation. In particular President Trump has latched onto the WHOâs criticism of his travel restrictions against China. But at another level, this move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curtail Chinaâs growing global influence, especially in international organisations. The Wall Street Journal reports that the decision stems from an ongoing discussion on whether to link US aid dollars to the number of Americans working in the groups that receive them. Trump ends the press conference after less than 90 minutes, cutting short one reporter who wanted to ask a second question on behalf of a colleague who could not attend today. ""Who cares,"" says the president with a shrug. No other members of the coronavirus task force, such as Vice-President Mike Pence, Dr Anthony Fauci or Dr Deborah Birx, spoke today. Trump is asked why he previously praised China's ""transparency"" but is today saying their ""so-called transparency"" cost lives. ""Well you know if Iâm so good to China then why am I the only person that closed our border so tightly to China?"" he hits back. ""I don't talk about China's transparency!"" he adds. In fact, on 24 January, whilst negotiating a trade deal, Trump tweeted: ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency."" Furthermore, other countries have also tightened their borders, and banned non-essential travel, in response to the outbreak. This exchange with the reporter arose because, earlier in this press conference, Trump said he was pulling US funding to the WHO because the agency ""defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising its so-called transparency"". Airports have been emptied amid the pandemic The US has agreed a roughly $25bn (Â£19.8bn) rescue package for 10 of the country's biggest airlines as travel plunges due to the coronavirus. American Airlines, United, Delta and Southwest are among the recipients. The money is to be provided through a combination of low-cost loans and direct grants. Congress had planned for the aid as part of its roughly $2.2tn emergency relief bill last month, but airlines had hesitated over some of the conditions. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said the airline deal would ""support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers"". ""We look forward to working with the airlines to finalise the necessary agreements and disburse funds as quickly as possible."" The president says: âWe have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.â The National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, National Hockey League have all either cancelled or delayed their seasons amid the pandemic. A sign at the closed Banc of California stadium in LA tells people to stay home Trump has been feuding with governors over who has the right to end lockdowns. But in a change of tone on Tuesday, he said: ""The governors are responsible, they have to take charge and do a great job."" He said the plans to reopen the country are close to being finalised and could be even earlier than 1 May. ""I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorising each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate."" He added: ""The federal government will be watching them closely. We will hold governors accountable, but will be working with them to make sure it goes really well."" Experts agree it's the state governors who are responsible for policing their states under US law. He said that governors âare going to do a great job of leading."" âAnd if weâre unhappy with a state, weâre going to let them know that weâre unhappy,"" he added. Zoos that should have been crowded in the sunny Easter holidays are now hard up, asking for donations, as the coronavirus lockdown bites. A zoo director in northern Germany has even admitted that some animals might soon have to be fed to others. ""We've listed the animals we'll have to slaughter first,"" NeumÃ¼nster Zoo's Verena Kaspari told Die Welt newspaper. She said killing some animals so that others could live would be a last resort, but even that would not solve the financial problem. Read more on this story here. The panda twins in Berlin Zoo would draw big crowds in normal times ""Many countries said they were going to listen to the WHO and they have problems now the likes of which they cannot believe,"" Trump continues. He adds: ""The world received all sorts of false information about misinformation and mortality."" If the WHO had gone to China to oversee the outbreak, mores lives would have been saved, he claims, adding that ""their reliance on China's disclosures... likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide and it may be much more than that."" ""So much death has been caused by their mistakes,"" he says. The US president previously praised China's role in containing the virus in this tweet, sent a few days after the two countries signed a trade deal. Allow Twitter content?

Trump also accused the WHO of putting political correctness above saving lives and taking China's claims about the outbreak at face value. Mr Trump has accused the WHO of being biased towards China in recent weeks, and recently attacked the organisation for being too âChina-centricâ in its tackling of the coronavirus pandemic. US financial contributions to the WHO accounted for just under 15% of its funding in 2019. The US decided against using a coronavirus test approved by the WHOin January, in favour of a test being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - but some of them did not work properly, and led to inconclusive results. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the first African head of the WHO, has beenaccused of being too cozy with China in the past. ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to access the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" says Trump. ""The WHO failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable,"" he adds. The White House coronavirus task force briefing has begun. You canwatch it live here. It comes a day after President Trump pilloried the media, argued with reporters, and played in the briefing room a campaign-style video praising his handling of the pandemic. California governor Gavin Newsom has warned that mass gatherings of hundreds or thousands of people are likely to be banned until at least summer. He made the announcement during a news conference on Tuesday, where he also said that stay-at-home orders could be loosened âa few weeksâ after evidence shows the rate of coronavirus infections and deaths are decreasing. He warned that things would be changing in the state and some measures may stay in place for some time. âYou may have dinner where the waiter is wearing gloves and maybe a face mask, where menus may be disposable, where your temperature is checked as you walk into the restaurant,â he said. Mass gatherings in the state, such as Coachella festival, have already been rescheduled or cancelled. A group of high school pupils in Calgary, Canada, have created a hotline for elderly people stuck under lockdown to hear a young human voice. The free telephone line, 1-877-JOY-4ALL, offers recordings of stories, jokes, letters, poetry, music and words of encouragement. New recordings, including in other languages, are being added every day. ""During these challenging times and ongoing public health measures, we know that it is especially difficult for seniors and folks experiencing isolation,"" their website says.

The comments were made by an unnamed diplomat and in part suggested that pensioners had been left to die in nursing homes.

""You know if somebody else endorsed that medication it would be great,"" he said, claiming that US media has remained skeptical just because he has supported it. ""But it's OK. The word is out. These people don't get it, the media, but the people get it,"" he continued. Â© 2025 BBC.
