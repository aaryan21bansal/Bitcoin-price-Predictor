"This video can not be played Everton's Calvert-Lewin scores England winner in U20 World Cup final England's Under-20 World Cup winners have been a revelation, sparking a fresh debate on youth development. A1-0 win over Venezuelain Sunday's final in South Korea gave England their biggest international title since 1966. So can the nation dare to dream that some of these players could go on to help revive the full senior side, perhaps even in time to help the FA achieve its stated aim ofa World Cup victory in 2022? Having not won a single match in the U20 tournament since 1997 - and failed to even qualify on four occasions over the past 20 years - manager Paul Simpson's side have confounded the theory that English youngsters are not as technically proficient as their European or South American rivals. Yet as well as pride and excitement, their success has also been met with scepticism about the inevitable talk of a new 'golden generation', and concern that this proves another false dawn. What does bode well for the future is that this squad appears to have been the result of a long-term plan, testament to the FA's National Football Centre at St George's Park, and its adherence to the sometimes derided'England DNA' philosophy, in which consistency of tactics through the various development teams - both male and female - is paramount. The FA may not have anywhere near as much control over youth coaching at the clubs as their counterparts in Germany - the DFB - but their vision does at least set a template for coaches, and now has a tangible example of what can be achieved. Certainly St George's Park has become familiar territory for the U20s, the core of which won the U17 Euros in 2014 under John Peacock, and then reached the semi-finals of the U19 Euros last year under Aidy Boothroyd. The Staffordshire site's location and cost has not been without controversy. And after England's abject humiliation at the hands of Iceland at Euro 2016, a solution to a generation of under-achievement seemed further away than ever. Several coaches, meanwhile, have left to join club set-ups. But five years after St George's Park opened, there are signs the FA's investment is paying dividends, and that it finally has players who can handle the pressure of tournament football. Is this the country's next golden generation? England win U20 World Cup This video can not be played Everton youngsters 'outstanding' - David Unsworth ""It is enormous what the FA have done"" Simpson told BBC Sport before the final. ""We want to develop the players into a certain style of play. Everything you see from the top national teams, we want to recreate that. ""This is the first group to come right through that pathway. We have eight teams qualified for tournaments this summer, both men and women, that is an unprecedented summer for English football teams."" He pointed to the ""massive financial investment"" in the facilities at St George's Park, the support staff, and the tournaments they have put the players through. ""I have been working with the U16s and we put the players on a trip to Brazil so they could experience South American opposition, the travelling, different climates,"" he said. ""This U20 group, we sent to South Korea last year so they experienced playing with an eight-hour time difference, and the humidity and temperature."" He said the FA had been trying to get its players accumulating caps at youth level in a way that players from countries like Germany and Spain do. ""There has been a level of consistency for selection, and they are now battle-hardened for tournament football,"" he said. ""We are trying to get our players to that level where they have played in major tournaments, played in Uefa competitions."" Simpson is quick to highlight the role of the clubs too, not only for the work done at their academies where most of the players' development is conducted, but for what he sees as a refreshing new attitude when it comes to the release of players. FA technical director Dan Ashworth appears to have improved relations with managers, with Everton boss Ronald Koeman for instance allowing five players to miss the last two weeks of the season to prepare for the U20 World Cup. Brought in to raise youth development standards, the Premier League's Elite Player Performance Plan - or EPPP - has seen significant investment in club academies, but is contentious. There are concerns that the replacement of the old tribunal system with a fixed-price compensation scheme has led to smaller clubs being short-changed, the stockpiling of young talent at the richest clubs, and even the closure of some lower-league academies. However, the Premier League believes the success of the U20s also suggests the EPPP is working, five years after it was established.

With the Premier League's record broadcast rights deals making it easier than ever for them to buy the best overseas talent, and the financial imperative of staying in the top flight often dissuading managers from taking a longer-term view, the task of breaking into first teams has never been tougher. A 2015 studyfound the percentage of club-trained players in Premier League squads had reached a new low, with just 11.7% graduated from their club's academy. A report released by Uefa in January found that 62% of players in England's top tier were foreign â the highest in Europe. Analysis byfootball365.com,externalhas revealed that 41 English players under the age of 22 played at least one Premier League game last season, totalling 16,532 minutes at an average of 403 minutes per player. In France it was 98 players, with 79,062 minutes of action, at an average of 806 minutes per player. Four Premier League sides - Manchester City, Middlesbrough, Stoke and Sunderland - did not give a single game to an English player currently under the age of 22. Despite the efforts of the FA's former chairman Greg Dyke, and calls for quotas in starting XIs, the Premier League has resisted pressure to further restrict foreign imports, sticking with the rule that eight places in 25-man squads must be 'home-grown players'. While 16 members of the U20s played first-team football last season, half of them had to go on loan to do so, with some - like goalkeeper Freddie Woodman (on loan at Kilmarnock from Newcastle) and forward Adam Armstrong (on loan at Barnsley from Newcastle) - enjoying highly successful spells at their adopted clubs. This video can not be played Woodman makes incredible save from Penaranda penalty Midfielder Kieran Dowell - one of the most impressive performers in South Korea - made no senior league appearances for Everton but stayed at Goodison, captaining coach David Unsworth's academy team to the title in the inaugural Under-23 competition - dubbed 'Premier League 2'. Some clubs - with Chelsea and their army of loanees the most obvious example - prefer to farm out their young players so they gain first-team experience. They say the pressure of matchday crowds and the intensity of competition is better for development than the more sheltered environment of the Under-23 league. Others question this strategy however, and prefer to keep their best young talent in-house. ""It is not for me to tell the clubs how to do their business, they have their own pathways lined up"" says Simpson diplomatically when asked which approach he prefers. ""We want to see as many of our players playing first-team football as possible. There are certainly some very good players in the Under-23 league involved in our teams. Liverpool striker Dominic Solanke was awarded the Golden Ball given to the player of the tournament ""The money that is available to clubs is brilliant for our game, and we will not complain about that. But it also means there is more money to bring foreign players in. ""What we have to do is keep working with our English players and try and get them to a level where clubs can trust them to go in and play. This tournament has really put players on the map."" With Tottenham's core of English youngsters proof of what is possible, the Premier League is encouraged that last season there was a 20% increase in the number of minutes (716) played by home-grown debutants. But the danger for the FA is that players who struggle to get first-team football - and remain uncapped in a competitive fixture at senior England level - could be tempted to switch allegiance. Six of the U20 squad qualify to play for Nigeria for instance, and with the FA having recently seen Wilfried Zaha and Alex Iwobi play for England's youth teams - but then slip through their fingers (to Ivory Coast and Nigeria respectively), Simpson admits it is a worry. ""It is the reality of it, and we always share a concern about that. If we do things properly, if we have the right facilities and treat the players properly then we have a feeling they will want to come back,"" he said. ""There will be the odd case like Wilfried where we will lose them, but we have to do everything we can and make an effort to build relations with the clubs and the positive relationship with the players so they are happy to come and represent England."" Simpson points out how impressive England's depth of talent is, with the likes of Patrick Roberts, Izzy Brown, Tammy Abraham, Marcus Rashford and Tom Davies all young enough to play at U20 level. When asked how many of his squad he hopes will go on to play for Gareth Southgate's full senior side, Simpson laughs. ""If I am going to be greedy, I would love to see them all of them do it, but that is living in a bit of a dream world,"" he said. ""There are no guarantees. But if we can just get a real core of them through. If we can keep them involved in first-team football then the future is really bright. That is what everyone inside the walls at the FA are keeping their fingers crossed for."" With former U21 manager Southgate as England manager, the sense is that players who come through the FA's age-group system will have more chance than ever to break into the senior squad. Whether they get sufficient opportunities at their clubs remains in doubt. But at least the U20s' exploits in South Korea may have made some managers pause and think whether they really need to look elsewhere.

" “Kilnasaggart Bridge” was a whispered curse on the lips of train travellers in the days of Northern Ireland’s Troubles. It nudges up close to the border that separates the six counties of Ulster in the United Kingdom from the Republic of Ireland. The bridge was such a popular target for IRA bombers that uninterrupted travel from north to south was often impossible. A groan would go up as the tinny tannoy announced that, because of problems on the line, all passengers would disembark at the Newry halt, travel by bus across the border and then clamber back on the train at Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland. We trundled on, we trundled off. It added at least an hour and more like two to the journey. So much for the “express”. But at least we knew we had crossed the border. Now, commuters sip posh coffee and sail past this once troubled spot, blissfully unaware of where the north ends, and where the Republic of Ireland begins. The border is there, but it is not there and the bombs are history. Drive along the modern motorway that links Belfast to Dublin and the only clue that you have crossed is the subtle switch from signposts in miles to those in kilometres. Keen-eyed, you might spot the change in the markings on the sides of the road. It is a child’s guessing game - north or south, are we there, aren’t we here? About 50 years ago, it was easier. The good roads were in Northern Ireland - you knew you had hit the Republic when the potholes rattled the car. The road signs in the south were more dramatic than the north. They came in sets and block capitals: SLOW; SLOWER; SLOWER STILL. The Killeen border checkpoint near Newry, 1987 This border is 310 miles (499km) long and meanders from Carlingford Lough in the east to Lough Foyle in the west. It was never a neat line. It is a squiggle across the map of Ireland – like an awkward child taking their crayon for a walk. That line divides rivers, slices fields, cuts bridges in two and even, occasionally, divides the odd house. Carlingford Lough marks the easternmost point of the border There are homes where you can have your breakfast in the north and go to sleep in the south. There are places where mobile phone reception in just one house fluctuates between north and south. The days of the Troubles are behind us - days lived in the dark shadow of watchtowers and turrets are vanished. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU, and the people of the borderlands are uneasy. Up to 35,000 people commute across the border every day. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. None of them wants a hard border, but the EU has stressed that there will have to be some form of customs control. What is a “soft” border? Will thousands of people find themselves cursing daily in long queues at border points? The village of Muff lies close to the border between Donegal and County Londonderry. During the Troubles, cars queued at the Army checkpoint, where twitchy young soldiers with rifles rattled out the usual questions. Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? Get out and open your boot, sir. Then it was on down a twist in the road and the Irish customs men were on their marks waiting to catch the locals with the contraband. Now, you’d hardly know you were crossing. A black corrugated hut at the old customs post is boarded up - weeds sprout from the chimney. Over the bridge and you’re into the one-street village. It is tiny but boasts four petrol stations. The Derry-Donegal crossing point at Muff There is what used to be an old Irish ballroom - a big, squat building called Borderland. When Derry city burned in riots and bombings, Borderland was the escape – the dance hall down the road, where you jived your way into another world. Marie Lindsay was born in Muff, but the city of Derry is centre stage in her heart. She lives in the hills just outside the village and has a foot in both camps. Each morning she gets into her car in Donegal, in the Republic, and drives up through a little wood. Then it’s on through a housing estate and into Derry, where she’s principal of a girls' school, St Mary’s College. Marie Lindsay, principal of St Mary's College, Derry She has lived her life along this border. Like thousands of others, she feels she has a double identity. Marie Lindsay in the art room at St Mary's College “I’m Donegal, born and bred. Donegal is in my DNA, but Derry is my home city, I feel I belong there,” she says. Her journey to work is seamless these days – down what was once an “unapproved” road - spiked, so that people could not drive across. As the Troubles in Northern Ireland escalated in the 1970s, the Army and police blocked and cratered the smaller roads to make all but the approved checkpoint routes impassable, and to stop paramilitaries crossing. Lindsay has known a hard border - the interminable waits at checkpoints. They were dark days that no-one really wants to recall. She has now grown used to peace and the ease of life. The spot marking the border is often nearly invisible On the evening drive home from work, she points out the spot where you have crossed. “The road signs switch from miles to kilometres, the road markings change, but that’s it,” she says. She carries two purses – a sterling purse for the north and a euro purse for the south. But both sides take each other’s currency at a decent rate. Many people carry two mobile phones – one north, one south. Talk to any of the girls in St Mary’s, says Lindsay, and you’ll soon find they have roots in Donegal – a granny in Malin, an aunty from Carndonagh. All down the years, city dwellers have taken a Sunday drive from Northern Ireland over the border to feast their eyes on the beauty of Five Fingers Strand, to nurse a pint in Buncrana, to treat the children to a ride on the swing boats by the shore. But the links amount to much more than a Sunday stroll. There are good schools in the city of Derry and the health service is free. Many people in Donegal send their children to school north of the border or are treated by the National Health Service -  some officially, some unofficially. There are pressing questions about students. Many from Northern Ireland travel to university in Dublin, Galway and Cork. Others from the Republic of Ireland cross the border to go to Queen’s in Belfast and to Derry’s Magee College and the North West Regional College. Magee College campus, Derry Lindsay is also concerned for the Donegal students who cross the border to go to the city’s further education college. “They could end up having to make the 40-minute drive to Letterkenny whereas before it was just 10 to 15 minutes into college in Derry.” On 23 June, 76p bought you one euro, but by the second week after the Brexit vote, that figure had shot up to 86p. It would reach a high of 90p last October, before falling back slightly since. For all those living in Donegal and working in Derry, the value of their sterling pay packets has plunged. In recent years, Lindsay’s Donegal village has played host to young families from Northern Ireland, lured by affordable housing. It has been a breath of fresh air – new life for the local primary school, tills ringing in the shops, a bustling community in the border village. But Brexit is making border folk start to think twice. Betty Holmes, Donegal Action for Cancer Care Betty Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care. The group is based in the Republic of Ireland but campaigns to access nearby health facilities in Northern Ireland. She is passionate about getting the best cancer care close at hand. It’s a deeply personal campaign. Her father died of lung cancer a week after her seventh birthday - he had never smoked. Her mother died from breast cancer three years later. When a new state-of-the-art radiotherapy centre opened recently in Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, there was a sigh of relief from families on both sides of the border. No more two-hour treks over the mountain pass from Derry to Belfast for those living with cancer in Northern Ireland’s western region. No more five-hour treks from Donegal to Galway for cancer patients living in the Republic of Ireland. “It is a good 308km to Galway and what sort of a journey is that when there is radiotherapy sitting a few miles across the border?” asks Holmes. The journey to Altnagelvin Hospital is as little as 45 minutes from the top end of Donegal at Malin Head, she says. The Irish government has invested in the new services in Northern Ireland. The Prince of Wales opened Altnagelvin's new cancer centre earlier this month Agreements in place between the UK and Irish governments mean there are currently places for 385 cancer patients coming across the border. But Brexit weighs heavily on Betty Holmes’s mind. “Our concern is what happens in three to five years when the real effect of Brexit is starting to be felt,” she says. If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” “Will the Irish government be in a position to pay what [is set] down as the cost of treating a cancer patient at Altnagelvin? Will that number be reduced from 385 to 200 initially and will it go down from there?” The sharing of medical services across the border is not a one-way street. “If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” Ciaran Crilly woke up to the news of Brexit last June  and immediately worried about his business. Just up from Cloughoge church on the Newry border, where the Army posts once cast long shadows on the high hill, is the sweet factory – a family business set up in the 1970s. Ten years before that Ciaran Crilly’s father, Peter, left for a sugary fact-finding mission, taking in the Mars factory in Slough, and then Blackpool to uncover the secret of getting the name through the stick of rock. In the 1970s, as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland, he came home, put his head down and set up a business. Now his son has the reins. Before Spanish holidays were the norm, the Crillys made seaside rock, selling it from Portrush in Northern Ireland to Bundoran and Bray in the Republic. This was the time when traditional sweets - bags of clove rock, bull’s eyes and brandy balls - still cast their spell. On both sides of the border, they still love their sweets. But Brexit was a blow. “It was terrible. Our business has been going superbly this last 10 years, year-on-year growth, no issues. Then you have this shock and you ask why did it need to happen?” Ciaran Crilly, Crillys Sweets The company was doing 75% of its business with the Republic of Ireland. When the UK exits Europe, if a trade deal isn’t reached, it could potentially face a 30% tariff in line with World Trade Organisation rules. That would be a worst-case scenario, says Crilly, but possible. For a while, Crilly considered upping sticks and moving a few miles down the road to set up in the Republic. Instead, they decided to stay put and look at new markets. In January, Crilly’s Sweets had a stand at a trade show in Germany and picked up business in Australia and China. They have been inundated with requests. Every emigrant craves the comforting taste of home. “We gained a lot of business through expats in Australia. People miss the kola cubes, pear drops, clove rock, mixed balls and even the jelly babies and wine gums,” he says. And, given the response from across the globe, perhaps Brexit could prove a blessing. But it’s an anxious time. “Half of our staff are from EU countries, such as Latvia and Poland. Will they stay?” Crilly doesn’t know. Drive on for an hour along the border and it’s sheep day at Enniskillen mart. The yard is a long line of muddy Land Rovers hauling trailers full of sheep and ewes. Men in flat caps, jeans and wellington boots meander about. Denzil Brady is 84 but wiry and keen-eyed. In all his years working on his father's farm in the hills around Enniskillen, he has had little time for the European Union. Denzil Brady “They're the greatest set of rogues in Brussels,” he says. “They have farms nearly out of business with the whole pile of paperwork. “With all those regulations, I fear for the young farmers in their 40s and how they'll suffer lives of misery.” Hugh Maguire has a different view. He has farmed for more than 50 years up by the famous Marble Arch Caves. His land straddles the border and he's had his share of headaches. He has cows and sheep, but some of them belong to the north and some belong to the Republic. It makes for two sets of paperwork and a few headaches. Woe betide the Irish sheep that sets a hoof over the border and vice versa. But Maguire believes the EU did a lot of good and Brexit is not welcome. He remembers the old days of smuggling across the border. He remembers the hard border, the checkpoints and queues and he just asks himself what lies ahead now. It could be a big step backwards, he says. “Farmers cannot farm without the European single farm payment,” he says. This is the agricultural subsidy payment, based on the area of a farmer's land, to offset the cost of producing food. James Johnston is the mart director - it's a family business that goes back to his grandfather's day. He's a young man and he admits that, personally, he is no fan of Europe. At its heart, [the EU]'s quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out.” “The EC originally was very good in terms of promoting free trade and promoting peace and security within Europe. “But I do think it has overstepped the mark as it has grown. Legislation-wise, it has just mushroomed. At its heart, it's quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out,”  he says. “However, where we are, here in this part of Ireland, in Fermanagh, we border with four of the southern counties, an open border is absolutely critical to peace and general well-being on both sides - free movement of people and goods.” Johnston argues that it must be maintained, however Brexit pans out. He'd like a more open border with the Republic of Ireland even than exists now. “It's exceptionally difficult, virtually impossible to bring livestock across the border, sell them in this mart and for traders to buy them and bring them home again. “It's easier for us to send cattle from the mart here to England and Scotland after a sale than to send them 10 or 12 miles down the road a stone's throw away across the southern border.” The problem lies with animal health and biosecurity, he says. Different policies exist on each side of the border. And now there will be more change. For farmers, the best-case scenario would be a post-Brexit free trade agreement, says Phelim O'Neill, a markets specialist for the Irish Farmers Journal. The worst-case scenario would see a very heavy tariff on agriculture products traded between the UK and the EU. “In terms of where will hit hard for Northern Ireland, somewhere between a quarter and a third of milk produced in Northern Ireland dairy farms goes to Ireland for processing,” he says. “So if you are one of those farmers, your milk will be hit with a very high tariff – it would not be viable to send it. “It is the same for sheep. About 400,000 sheep each year go from NI to factories in Ireland for processing. If the WTO tariffs apply, then it simply would not be viable.” Colm McKenna People who own petrol stations along the border know all about boom and bust - trade depends on currency fluctuations and significantly lower fuel duty rates in the Republic of Ireland. Enda McColgan, manager of the Texaco in Muff, says 90% of the garage’s customers come from Northern Ireland to top up. Business is booming. There was one stage when demand was so great they even had to employ somebody to manage the traffic on the road outside. Enda McColgan: Business is booming Garage owner Colm McKenna remembers bombings, the checkpoints and the days of soldiers in ditches. “If we had a hard border then we’d be going back 30 years in six weeks to six months,” he says. It’s not hard to imagine who might target such a border, he points out. Some have warned that a hard border could be used as a justification for violence by dissident republicans who do not support the current peace agreements in Northern Ireland. Kevin Melarkey Not far away, at another crossing, Kevin Melarkey is the egg man on the border at Bridgend near Derry. He's there at the farm shop seven days a week - in a small hut - selling eggs and bags of spuds. He has a good thick coat and a pair of mountain boots to keep out the cold. When he gets a minute, he can stand outside his hut and rest his eyes on the blue hills of Donegal. He's too young to remember much more than the queues at the checkpoints on a Sunday when half of the city decamped across the border to Buncrana or to buy cheap petrol. Like everyone else, he does not know what Brexit will bring. “We're in limbo, it's just a waiting game,” he sighs. Brexit and border changes will be more significant for Northern Ireland, says Katie Daughen, head of Brexit Research and Support Services to the British/Irish Chamber of Commerce. Every year 31% of NI exports are to the Republic and 27% of its imports come from there. The main sector to be affected is food and agriculture. “It’s worth over £4.5bn to the economy in the north and it’s by far the most exposed.” Katie Daughen: Changes will be more significant north of the border Daughen lists a couple of examples of the all-island nature of the economy: • Wheat grown in the south is processed in north•    40% of chicken produced in the south is processed in the north One of Ireland’s most famous exports faces similar problems. Guinness is brewed in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. But it’s sent north of the border to be bottled or canned before returning to Dublin for export to the world. But it is not all doom and gloom.  There are opportunities out there too. The border’s disappearance was a gradual shift - like ice melting. After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, things moved slowly. But the dragon’s teeth  - ugly concrete blocks squatting on hundreds of country roads linking north and south -  were suddenly yanked. The soldiers in their camouflage passed out of view. In 2003, they took away the checkpoint at Newry. They pulled down the ugly iron cage, the military turret high on the hill above the church at Cloughoge. The tower above Cloughoge The people who felt safer for the presence of the Army on the hilltop called it a watchtower. Those who resented the Army, and their high power cameras, preferred “spy post”. It was close to that Newry border where Lord Justice Gibson and his wife Cecily were killed by an IRA bomb in 1987. 1987: Wreckage from the explosion which killed Lord Justice Gibson and his wife A year later, Robin and Maureen Hanna and their son, David, six, died in an IRA explosion after crossing the border. The family from Hillsborough in the north were returning from holiday when their vehicle was mistaken for one belonging to a senior judge. The big military turret went up on the hill after that. It was a stretch of road that became a no-man’s land between north and south. It was not a place for a friendly chat - there was tension in the air, the soldiers were edgy. Crossings were never easy. Many resented the waiting and the questioning. People were afraid they might get caught up, a sitting target for a bomber. Or scared that a soldier might even get trigger happy. But there was another side to the old border too. The game of “catch me if you can” with the customs officers still raises a smile. A customs post on the Belfast-Dublin road in the 1950s Butter was cheaper  on one side – hide it in the pram and sit the child on top. It was all the sweeter for being illicit. Young couples from the north took the train to Dublin to buy the wedding ring. There are tales of dangling the ring out of the train window on a thread on the way home to evade the keen eye of the customs man. In Fermanagh, drive down past the town of Enniskillen and on to the border towns of Belcoo and Blacklion and you see how past and present merge. The stone bridge marks the crossing point between north and south. The bus stop in Belcoo has two sets of signs – a blue and white sign for the Ulsterbus and a green one with a greyhound for Bus Éireann. The street signs are in both English and Irish. Harold Johnston has an old-fashioned shop just over the bridge in Blacklion. His grandmother opened it in 1901. “She was a trained seamstress and had five dressmakers upstairs at one time. She used to do wedding dresses and red flannel petticoats.” A century later, her grandson presides over an Aladdin’s cave. It is a drapery and a clothes shop and a wool shop and whatever you like. The shoe boxes are piled high, there are rolls of oilskin tablecloth propped up. From the door, Johnston can look left to where the customs post and Irish gardaí once stood, checking the cars coming south. “There were 43 guards and six sergeants at that border,” he says. “We had 24-hour cover and two shifts. We had patrol cars patrolling the back roads. “They were stationed in the barracks on the left.  The young lads were sent up from Dublin for training along the border.” In the 1930s, the Depression hit hard but on 3 September 1939 trade exploded on his side of the bridge when war was declared. “They were putting restrictions in the north and it was scarcity this and scarcity that. But we had lots of butter and sugar.” Harold Johnston Smuggling was rife. Johnston tells a story about the undertaker in Blacklion in the Republic who was running short on shrouds, but had a friend across the border in Belcoo who knew another man that could get him some. The problem was getting them over the bridge from north to south. “Yer man came into the bar in Blacklion and said the parcel had arrived and he had it with him,” Johnston says. “So he went into the kitchen and he had on a coat three times too big and he opened it and he had put all the shrouds on himself and walked over the border like that. “As he took the shrouds off in the kitchen at the back, yer man looked at him and said: ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a man taking a shroud off’.” During the Troubles, there were just 20 official border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The British Army shut down, spiked or cratered the rest. With peace, the country relaxed, breathed a sigh of relief, and unspiked the roads. Trade and business became more fluid – it blossomed. Businesses in Northern Ireland set up offices in the Republic and vice versa. Seamus Leheny from the Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association knows the pain of those whose businesses may be disrupted by Brexit. An Irish revenue commissioner has said up to 8% of freight crossing the border might be subject to checks after Brexit. With a minimum of 6,000 lorries trundling over the border every day, you begin to see the scale of the problem. “That makes at least 500 lorries that could be checked every day,"" says Leheny. ""Added to that is the thought that drivers selected for checking might have to drive away from the main flow of traffic to a specific post – and distance costs money. Even if there are to be checks it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be a string of traditional border posts with long queues of lorries. The head of the Irish tax authorities has said he is ""practically 100% certain"" there will be no new customs posts along the border after Brexit. Niall Cody said businesses, however, must assume there will be “some form of customs” post-Brexit - it might be that people would be allowed to make declarations online. Ongoing analysis of cross-border trade increasingly shows that most goods transported between the jurisdictions will not need to be physically checked, Cody suggested. Still, there are those who might be less than scrupulous and could take advantage by shipping goods into Belfast and straight into the EU via Dublin – without paying the tariffs. Then, think about the large retailers who treat the island of Ireland as an entity – one market. They get the goods to Belfast, use distribution centres to sort and store, and send them on by lorry on to Galway, Cork and Dublin. “They may ship directly rather than go through a whole bureaucratic process. Jobs could be lost in Northern Ireland,” Leheny says. Eamon O'Farrell, a former customs officer in Donegal who spent 30 years patrolling the border, says the Irish authorities are “ill equipped” to deal with border checks. It's not the main roads, it's the hundreds of unapproved roads. “I cannot figure out how they're going to do this with the resources that I understand they have,” he says. “You wouldn't get 12 people across the whole border who know where the actual border is. We're talking about the revenue risk, tax evasion, various types of smuggling - goods and people.” On the ground, people are thinking ahead. There are cross-border meetings and countless committees working out the logistics of a border that is longer than the length of the island of Ireland. At government level, civil servants in London are getting their heads around the conundrum of Northern Ireland. One thing that looks likely to continue is the Common Travel Area (CTA), the bilateral UK-Ireland agreement that allows for free movement of UK and Irish citizens between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The arrangement allows Irish and UK citizens the right to work, to access public services and to vote in certain elections, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has described the continuation of the CTA as ""non-negotiable"". Jane Morrice, former head of the European Commission office in Northern Ireland, helped broker the Good Friday Agreement during her time as a politician. She wants to maintain the status quo on the island of Ireland. She is proposing that Northern Ireland should have honorary membership of the EU after the UK's departure. “We've made such good progress since the Good Friday Agreement. Removing the border and removing borders in mind as well as geographically has been hugely successful and we cannot allow ourselves to halt that or reverse it in any way,” she says. “The role played by the EU in the peace process was instrumental.” Border dwellers are hardy as the weeds and thistles sprouting from the old huts at the customs posts. They have come through partition and war and the Troubles. Harold Johnston tells the story of a villager in the 1920s who travelled up the road to Enniskillen in Northern Ireland for his groceries every week. Partition hit home on the very day of his weekly shop. On his return journey, a fresh new customs hut had sprung up at the border and a man in a starched uniform was waiting for him. “You can’t bring those goods into the Free State,” said the customs man. “But I always have,” said the man. “Well, you can’t now,” said the new officer. The man turned back for a sit and a think in nearby Belcoo, Northern Ireland. What did he do? Johnston pauses and smiles. “He sat and waited for the customs officer to shut up shop for the night and sure didn’t he just walk over the border.” There is always a way.

"The advisers had been with Theresa May in the Home Office Theresa May's two key advisers have resigned after a disastrous election campaign. Who are they and how much responsibility did they really have for what went wrong? Their fingerprints were all over several of Mrs May's policies and they had a very firm grip on the keys to her door. The close-knit trio - made up of the bearded Brummie big-thinker Nick Timothy, the boisterous and cavalier Scot and former hack Fiona Hill, and their boss, Theresa May - go back seven years to when they all worked together at the Home Office. Both Ms Hill and Mr Timothy already had roles within the Conservative Party before becoming the then-home secretary's special advisers. Some Conservatives want Theresa May to change her approach With a first-class degree in politics, Mr Timothy had entered the party's research department and was already known to have advised May on a range of issues when she was in the shadow cabinet. Following her work as a journalist, Fiona Hill had swapped sides to become a Tory press officer. Once appointed as Theresa May's joint chiefs-of-staff - in a department tasked with keeping citizens safe and secure - both Ms Hill and Mr Timothy were adamant their boss would be heavily protected too. One former minister told me they were ""her Praetorian Guard"". Coalition in 2010 brought the need for partnerships in power but within 24 hours of his new ministerial post at the Home Office, the Liberal Democrat Norman Baker said Mrs May's coterie had already briefed against him in the press.  He battled to influence policy but found it akin to ""walking through mud"". Live updates and rolling coverage No 10 was 'toxic' says former May aide Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? It's difficult to tell whether the stubbornness Theresa May displayed at times - I was told by one former government adviser ""turning her is like turning the Titanic"" - rubbed off on her advisers or whether it was already their style. Such close teamwork often results in close political confidants becoming a reflection of their master's image. A former senior Tory insider said they ran the operation with unremitting hostility towards people and told me ""they thought it was advantageous to pick fights in empty rooms"". Lynton Crosby is another strategist whose tactics have been questioned Reflecting on their resignations, the adviser gave this assessment: ""Ultimately you need political capital and coalitions in politics and they didn't have that and that's why they had to go so quickly."" But during their time in office, those same close relationships meant Mrs May's key advisors' personal beliefs were to help shape government policy. Issues like promoting grammar schools, combating mental illness, the Modern Slavery Act, stop and search reforms, a reticence towards nuclear power - all stemmed from May's ""enforcer and brains trust"" team of Nick and Fiona, as one former adviser said. But after four years, their tight teamwork was abruptly ended, for the first time, when the behind-the-scenes tactics came to the fore. Fiona Hill resigned after briefing on an increase of extremism in schools, publicly pitting her boss against the then-Education Secretary Michael Gove. A dispute with Michael Gove led to Fiona Hill's first resignation Nick Timothy soon left too after a row with the party when he refused to campaign against UKIP in a by-election. But it was the uncharted political landscape caused by the Brexit vote that threw them an unexpected lifeline back into mainstream politics. As soon as David Cameron announced his resignation, hours after he lost the vote in 2016, they were drafted in to run Theresa May's Conservative leadership campaign. Soon after, they followed Theresa May into No 10 and their influence has been immense. In fact, a picture soon emerged of their overarching power over the PM's policies, diary and decision-making. One former minister complained to me that ""nobody could get access to them - including her own ministers"". As an illustration of what the relationship was like between Ms Hill and the prime minister, I was told by a number of sources that Ms Hill would on occasion boss her boss around. A former minister said Fiona Hill would ""tell her what to do and tick her off"". Ben Gummer played a key role in the manifesto but lost his seat in the election I asked if anyone else did that to Mrs May. ""No-one else other than her husband,"" my source replied. One Tory insider who knows both Fiona Hill and Alastair Campbell well had an interesting observation about how each dealt differently with selling tough news. Where Tony Blair's so-called bodyguard would try to deploy charm, Ms Hill could become ""aggressive"". I'm told it wasn't just in her dealings with the press but also with senior cabinet ministers, either in person or via text messages. This sort of behaviour may have, in the end, undermined the many successes the team enjoyed, and made surviving a bad election result almost impossible. As Mr Timothy wrote as he announced his resignation, the trio had just helped win ""more than 13.6 million votes, which is an historically high number, and more than Tony Blair won in all three of his election victories"", only to be thwarted by ""an unexpected surge in support for Labour"". Perhaps too they were thwarted by a lack of goodwill among even the closest of co-workers. By overseeing policy in the much-criticised election manifesto, Nick Timothy undoubtedly made some mistakes, leaving the prime minister exposed. One former government adviser told me privately that Mr Timothy and Ms Hill weren't solely to blame for the problems besetting the beleaguered PM but they were a significant part. ""Like their boss,"" the adviser said of the PM's gatekeepers, ""they skated on foundations a mile wide and an inch thick. They lacked flexibility, charm and a listening mode. Hill in particular never understood you don't have to shout, you have to communicate."" So how will Theresa May cope without them? Her colleagues will be looking for her to become more collegiate. A former minister said she has not spent much time cultivating friends in Parliament, leaving her without many. Without Nick Timothy's presence, we may start to notice shifts in government policy, such was his influence - including on big-ticket items like the government's approach to the Brexit negotiations. Much will of course be determined by who Mrs May picks as their replacements, but it's too early to say how comfortable she will be surviving without them.

"The cemetery in 2007 Not so long ago, the Jews of Baghdad were one of the great trading communities in Asia. In the southern Indian port city of Chennai - Madras, as it once was - Andrew Whitehead came across a last remnant of the Jewish presence there, and stumbled on a tragic love story. I was told the place would be difficult to find - tucked away on a busy market street not far from Marina beach, with stalls obscuring the entrance. But I spotted the star of David standing proud. The  gates had recently been painted sky blue, and over the entrance were the wordsBeit Ha Haim, Hebrew for The House Of Life. In other words, a Jewish cemetery. The gates were padlocked. One of the market women gestured to me to wait - she got out her phone - another woman found me a plastic chair and assured me, ""Someone coming."" Half-an-hour later, Kumari appeared - a bustling, well set woman in a pink sari. She had a bunch of keys, and within a couple of minutes I was ushered into a tiny graveyard, little bigger than a badminton court. It was a touch forlorn-looking, but clearly well-kept. And in case I hadn't cottoned on who was responsible for the upkeep, Kumari wielded her broom energetically to clear leaves from the gravestones. The synagogue in what was Madras was demolished decades ago. The city now has no Jewish community, though some say there are still a few individuals. The cemetery is just about all that's left, and that's moved, perhaps twice, down the years. Only a handful of the older graves have survived, the most substantial that of Abraham Salomons, a coral merchant, who died in 1745. There's a handful of 20th Century graves. One caught my eye - a woman who died in 1943 in her early twenties, Victoria M Sofaer. What was the story behind that early death? Well, there's a family history website devoted to the Sephardic Jewish diaspora. Victoria - I discovered - was known as Toyah, and born in Baghdad. But curiously, her family didn't know about her grave - or exactly when or where Toyah died. Through that website, I made contact with Toyah's niece - and indirectly with Toyah's half-brother, Abraham, now 94 and living in a nursing home in Toronto. He was born two years after Toyah and was the closest to her in the family. They were surprised to learn of Toyah's grave. In turn they unsettled me with the troubling story of Toyah's life and death - barely known even within the family, and never rehearsed beyond its bounds. Toyah's father, Menashi, was the proprietor of the British General Supply Store in Baghdad in the 1920s and 1930s. They imported Swiss cheese, French brandy, American cigarettes, Belgian chocolate, and had a grand shop on Rashid Street, Baghdad's main street back then. In 1940 or thereabouts, Toyah fell in love with an Armenian man from the family that ran the ladies' wear shop on the other side of the street. Her family found out. They were determined to put a stop to the romance. They tried to find a Jewish groom - she turned them all down. So they shipped Toyah out - to India. From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 and Thursdays at 11:00 Abraham, Toyah's half-brother, was then living in Bombay to avoid service in the Iraqi army. Late in 1942, his parents turned up there with Toyah in tow. ""She was in complete shock, silent - she never said a word to me"", he recalls. ""It saddened me greatly."" Kumari, busily sweeping leaves, on Andrew Whitehead's recent visit to the cemetery After a while, Toyah and her parents moved on - he wasn't told where. Then he heard that Toyah had died. And their parents returned to Baghdad. They didn't talk about what happened. It was only later that Abraham found out from his grandmother about Toyah's transgressive romance. ""I believe my sister died from a broken heart,"" he says. I asked if there were any likenesses of Toyah. I was sent a family portrait  of three boys. Toyah would have been seven at the time. Why wasn't she included? She had been! When she died, her parents retouched the photo to remove her image. Done - says Toyah's niece - so that there was no reminder of the scandal and the tragedy. Abraham (left) with brothers Elias, and Jack - and no Toyah, who originally appeared to the right of the picture, overlapping with Elias's left arm Another photo has emerged. It may, just may, include Toyah. A serious looking young girl with tousled hair, no-one's quite sure if it's her - and more than 70 years after her death, I guess we'll never know. Toyah's brother is comforted to know she has a proper grave, and to be able to talk within the family about the fate his sister suffered. It's offered him some closure and given his sister public acknowledgement of the wrong done to her. His daughter dropped me a line. ""Bringing back memories of Toyah"", she said, ""is incredibly moving for us."" It is for me too.

"Thousands of people attend E3 every year Gamers from around the globe are heading to Los Angeles for the E3 video games showcase, which lays out what players can expect in the year ahead. E3 is traditionally an industry-only event, but in recent years some studios have held their own showcases and broadcast them to fans online. This year, for the first time in its 24-year history, 15,000 video game fans will be allowed to attend too. One analyst said it was a sign of E3 adapting for modern times. ""E3 originally was a retail conference, about connecting buyers with the publishers,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls of the consultancy IHS Markit. ""The industry has changed significantly since then, so E3 has to move with the times. ""It's a process to make it much more publicly available, and it's a good move - it keeps it relevant."" E3 begins on Tuesday 13 June - but many games studios including Microsoft and Sony hold their own events a little earlier. Microsoft's Phil Spencer announced Project Scorpio in 2016 Last year, Microsoft announced it was working on ""the most powerful console ever"", code-named Project Scorpio. The company has already described the computing power of the device, which it says will be capable of playing ultra-high definition 4K games - but this could be the first time we see the device and hear what it will be called. ""This will re-establish their credentials with the gamers who want the highest graphical capability,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls. ""I'm expecting it to be more expensive than the PS4 Pro, so it's probably not going to sell as strongly - but will give Microsoft a boost towards the end of the year."" Nintendo says Switch is its fastest-selling console Nintendo says its new Switch console is off to a promising start, with about three million sold, making it the company's fastest-selling device. The launch was buoyed by the highly-anticipated Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, which Nintendo dedicated its entire E3 exhibition to in 2016. To keep momentum, the Japanese games-maker will be showing off multiplayer games such as Splatoon 2, Arms and Pokken Tournament DX. However, many players are still hopeful that Nintendo will announce some surprises - such as the first full Pokemon game for the Switch. Sony has sold a million PS VR headsets Sony says sales of its virtual reality kit for the PlayStation 4 have exceeded expectations, with more than a million people picking up a PS VR headset. But the challenge for all headset developers is to show off compelling games that will encourage more people to invest in the costly kit. ""It's a key focus for Sony, because it's different from what Microsoft is offering with Xbox,"" Mr Harding-Rolls told the BBC. ""There have been some good launch titles, such as the VR mode on Resident Evil which was very well received. ""Is spread by word of mouth because it was so impressive and frankly scary - we need more of that, big brands and big titles.""

"""Check this out,"" says Royal Blood's frontman, Mike Kerr, pulling up his t-shirt to reveal a throbbing purple bruise. ""I think,"" he says, ""I've cracked my rib."" Kerr sustained his injury ""falling off the drum riser"" in Brighton during the band's first show in 18 months, the night before our interview - but he's surprisingly blasÃ© about it. ""I had enough whiskey to fall asleep,"" he grins, ""and a good friend of mine is a paramedic, so I had a shower at my house and went to see him. ""I'm sure it's fine."" It's not the first time the band have been maimed in the line of duty. On their first UK tour four years ago, drummer Ben Thatcher dislocated his finger in the middle of a show. ""He just got some gaffer tape and gaffered his two fingers together and played the rest of the set,"" Kerr says, matter-of-factly. Later, on a US tour, their sound technician ""lost a testicle"", requiring emergency surgery. The details of that trauma are not up for discussion. Royal Blood: Mike Kerr (bass, vocals) and Ben Thatcher (drums, baseball caps) Hopefully, then, the band will remain injury-free in the run-up to Glastonbury, where they're third on Friday's main stage bill, just behind Radiohead and The xx. ""Glastonbury is such a big deal,"" marvels Thatcher. ""The Pyramid Stage is the biggest stage in the world."" The set will rely heavily on their second album, How Did We Get So Dark?, released this Friday. It's a record that takes their rampaging rock riffs and pushes them in unexpected directions. Lead single Lights Out contains bursts of 1970s T-Rex backing vocals, while the piano-led Hole In Your Heart reflects the band's love of R&B. The BBC sat down with the duo to talk about the perks of fame; the perils of touring; and why they have ""a delicate sound"". Here are six of their best stories. The band's hard rock riffs have been compared to Foo Fighters, Black Sabbath and Queens of the Stone Age Recording How Did We Get So Dark? gave the band the opportunity to experiment with new sounds and techniques. It did not go well. ""One thing we learned is we have quite a delicate sound and once you add things - the wrong things - our whole sound sort of shrivels,"" says Mike. ""Or it capsizes and it doesn't sound like us any more. We've realised a lot of the identity of our music is when me and Ben play together."" ""Even the backing vocals - we did try having girls come in and sing, but it just didn't work. It had to be my voice. It had to be just about me and Ben."" The band follow in the tradition of two-piece bands like The White Stripes and The Black Keys Royal Blood are a compact unit. Ben plays drums. Mike plays bass and sings. For some reason, though, this set-up has mystified journalists everywhere. ""'Why are you just a two-piece band?'"" Mike sighs. ""We get asked that all the time. I guarantee Kings Of Leon have never been asked why they're a quartet."" ""Our whole two-piece thing really was not thought about at all,"" he explains. ""Once I plugged in [the bass] and showed Ben the sound, it was like, 'Cool, let's write the songs'. ""I wasn't thinking, 'what if it wasn't just the two of us?'"" ""Making a record and writing for that long, you kind of forget what you're doing. And the whole premise of our band is that we're a live band. That's Royal Blood in its purest form."" Lars Ulrich took the band to visit the house from Mrs Doubtfire As they toured the world, Royal Blood picked up a few celebrity hangers-on. After a show in San Franciso, Metallica's Lars Ulrich knocked on their dressing room door, bundled them into the back of a car andgave them a tour,externalof his hometown. When Ben turned 27, Led Zeppelin star Jimmy Page turned up to his birthday party andate an apple crumble,external. Best of all, the drummer was invited to play Tommy Lee's giant ""drum rollercoaster,"" which travelled, upside down above the audience's heads on Motley Crue's 2015 farewell tour. ""It's insane. He's insane,"" laughs Ben. ""I went down to Wembley Arena, they strapped me in and then, when it started going up, I just thought, 'What am I doing?' ""I hadn't thought about it properly. I was like, 'This is going to be so much fun' and then it was terrifying."" Still, he managed to compose himself and thrash out a few solos. ""It's a different kind of playing. When you're upside down you're fighting the gravity. But it's a roller-coaster. The adrenalin lets you do things that you can't normally do."" This video can not be played Royal Blood perform Little Monster at BBC Introducing's SXSW Showcase in Austin, Texas. Back in 2015, Mike told Q Magazine he'd written ""about 50"" new songs for Royal Blood's second album. A claim which turns out to have been a big fat whopper. ""I said that two days after we came off tour,"" he laughs. ""They went, 'How many songs have you written?' and I said 50. ""I thought it was funny because we'd only been working on the album for two days."" In the end, though, the band wrote more than that, recording a procession of demos and rough drafts in a rehearsal space in Burbank, Los Angeles. ""A lot of our songs start as very small ideas  - something as little as a drumbeat or a riff,"" says Mike. ""Anything creative gets recorded, basically. ""We build a library of ideas, and the ones that really get into our heads and stick around, we usually see them through and build them into songs."" After the summer festival season, the band launch a UK tour in November Cracked ribs and broken fingers aside, the band have upped the stakes at their live shows by trying to replicate the layered textures of their second album. ""I was worried we'd snookered ourselves,"" admits Mike, ""I considered getting other musicians in, and then Ben saved the day. It's so impressive when you watch it."" On stage, the drummer not only has to play his own, intricate rhythm tracks, but triggers all the sampled backing vocals and sound effects that pepper the new record. He does this without playing to a click-track, locked to the tempo of the recorded elements, to stop him drifting out of time. ""There's one sample that's 16 bars long,"" says Mike, looking worried by the mere thought of it. ""It's a long, slow pitch bend that if you play the song too fast, you miss it. ""But Ben's a wizard, so that helps."" Blood on the tracks? Band on the run? Royal motorcade? Oh, I give up... ""We've stopped playing some of the songs from the first album,"" says Mike. ""There's a few that we've grown out of. There might be the odd lyric that I wouldn't say any more. I guess I don't agree with myself like I used to!"" In fact, confesses Ben, they dropped Careless during their 2015 tour, despite only having 10 songs to choose for the set list from their debut album. ""It is a good song,"" he says. ""We just don't get the buzz from playing it live."" Similarly, Ten Tonne Skeleton, frequently a highlight of their live shows ""isn't much fun to play, for some reason"". ""It's quite laborious,"" says Mike, ""but as soon as we start into it, you see the crowd go nuts, and that's a real buzz."" How Did We Get So Dark? is released on Friday, 16 June.

"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello (C) and his wife Beatriz Rossello (R) greet voters The US territory of Puerto Rico has voted to ask Congress to make it America's 51st state. More than 97% of voters favoured attempting to join the US over becoming independent or remaining a self-governing territory. However, just 23% of the electorate turned up to cast their ballot amid an opposition boycott, and its results are non-binding. The final decision is also not in their hands but  up to Congress. It did not act on the previous referendum's result, which was the first time ever a majority of valid votes were cast for statehood in the former Spanish colony. Close to 30% of all voters in that election cast blank or invalid ballots, a situation which generated doubts about the vote's political legitimacy. The 2017 referendum was called by the government of the island against a background of economic crisis, which some attribute at least partially to Puerto Rico's unusual legal status, halfway between independence and full statehood. Opponents of the vote back keeping the status quo. Puerto Rico profile There were protests against the vote to become the 51st state The current governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo (""Ricky"") Rossello, who was sworn in on 2 January, campaigned on a promise of seeking full statehood for the island, which he says is needed to solve the current economic recession affecting Puerto Rico, the worst in decades. The economic crisis has led to large government deficits, a severe cutback in public services, an increase in local utility rates and sales taxes as well as ongoing protests against local and federal authorities, which are expected to continue. The island's government says it cannot meet all of its $72bn (Â£56bn) debt obligations. Statehood advocates point out that while US laws have allowed other heavily indebted US local governments to seek bankruptcy protection, Puerto Rico has fewer means of legal defence because it is not a US state. Proponents of statehood also argue that if it became fully integrated into the Union, Puerto Rico would receive more federal spending to reactivate the economy, which currently has an unemployment rate close to 12%. How did Puerto Rico get into such a mess? All Puerto Ricans are already US citizens, with unrestricted rights to settle on the US mainland. But if they obtained statehood, Puerto Ricans living on the island would for the first time be able to vote in US presidential elections, and would elect lawmakers with the right to vote in the US Congress. This video can not be played Artists in Puerto Rico fight gentrification and try to define the island's identity. Puerto Ricans would also become eligible for the full welfare benefits currently available to US citizens living in the 50 states. On the other hand, Puerto Ricans on the island would have to start paying full federal income taxes. They currently do not pay US income taxes on earnings obtained on the island. Few expect current US lawmakers to be very enthusiastic about eventual statehood for Puerto Rico. A man signs a voting list before casting his ballot One big reason is that the Republican-controlled US Congress might be wary of a move that could erode their majority in both houses by allowing the Democratic-leaning Puerto Rican electorate to choose two new senators and several members of the House of Representatives. Also, granting Puerto Rico statehood would lead to greater federal spending on the island, which could prove unpopular at a time when the Republican majority in Congress is calling for sweeping spending cuts. Puerto Rico would be the poorest state in the Union, with many of its residents becoming eligible for greater federal welfare payments. How did Puerto Rico get into such a mess?

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Putting together a Cabinet that reflects the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative party."" Theresa May said the government planned to focus on social issues and ""delivering a successful Brexit"", as she completed a Cabinet reshuffle. The PM said the new line-up brought in ""talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party"". Her comments came after Michael Gove, one of the driving forces behind Brexit, returned to the front bench as environment secretary. She said it was a ""government that's going to be governing for everyone"". Damian Green has been made first secretary of state in the reshuffle. The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of the PM, her second in command. When asked if she had brought back Mr Gove - seen by some as an adversary - after being left weakened by the snap election result, Mrs May said her reshuffle had ""seen people from across the party accepting the invitation to be in my cabinet"". ""Crucially I've brought in talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party. We want a country that works for everyone."" She said she had appointed ""a cabinet that will get on with the job of government"". ""That's about delivering a successful Brexit negotiations. And those negotiations start in a week's time."" Mrs May also said the government would be tackling issues such as the Brexit negotiations, and such issues as education, ""dealing for the need for more housing"" and a ""proper mental health legislation that is going to support people"". And when asked if she would continue in office, she replied: ""I said during the election campaign if re-elected, I would serve a full term."" Mr Gove told Sky News he was ""quite surprised"" to be asked to join the cabinet. ""Of course I knew that today was re-shuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa."" The previous Environment Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been appointed as the Leader of the House in the Commons. Most other ministers have kept their roles -  but Liz Truss is moved from justice to chief Treasury secretary. Commons Leader David Lidington takes over as justice secretary and lord chancellor. Chief Treasury Secretary David Gauke has been appointed work and pensions secretary. Michael Gove was not given a Cabinet position when Mrs May assumed the role of PM last year Mrs May had been expected to carry out a widespread reshuffle of her top team after Thursday's general election but her room for manoeuvre has been limited by her failure to win an overall majority. Most of the cabinet jobs remain unchanged: Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Secretary of State for the Home Department - Amber Rudd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs - Boris Johnson Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union - David Davis Secretary of State for Defence - Michael Fallon Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley International development - Priti Patel Transport - Chris Grayling Business - Greg Clark Damian Green, who was previously work and pensions secretary and was at university with Mrs May, has also become minister for the Cabinet Office, a position left vacant by Ben Gummer, who lost his seat in Thursday's general election. The first secretary of state is a role previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson and could see Mr Green standing in for Theresa May at prime minister's questions when she is not available. The role is periodically used by UK governments and did not exist in Mrs May's first cabinet, formed after she became prime minister in July last year. It does not come with a government department but does give its holder seniority over other cabinet ministers and is seen as being similar to the role of deputy prime minister. Andrea Leadsom takes over from David Lidington Boris Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades. ""I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."" According to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin, some green campaigners have reservations over Mr Gove's appointment. Tom Burke, from the think tank e3g, told the BBC: ""The environment is something young voters really care about. ""If the Tories really want to reconnect with the youth surge, this is about the worst option they could have chosen."" But a senior farming source said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had ""long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who's being put out to grass"". In the latest fallout from the general election result, which confounded pollsters and left the UK with ahung Parliament: An influential Conservative MP predicted Tory manifesto policies including on grammar schools would have to be ""slimmed down"" Mrs May was accused of putting her party interest above the Northern Ireland peace process with the planned DUP alliance Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be PMand would try to amend the Queen's Speech Former Tory Chancellor George Osbornedescribed Mrs Mayas a ""dead woman walking"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mrs May would have to adopt a more ""collective"" approach to making decisions Pro-EU Conservativespredictedthe outcome of the general election would change the government's approach to Brexit Liz Truss was criticised for not standing up for judges involved in a Brexit court case Liam Fox retains his position as international trade secretary - he told reporters he was ""delighted"" to be continuing in the role he has held since July last year. ""It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."" Liz Truss's change of position will be seen by some as a demotion - she was widely criticised by the judiciary following the High Court ruling regarding the government seeking Parliament's permission to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal start of the Brexit process. The judges involved were heavily criticised by some newspapers, and Mrs Truss was in turn criticised for failing to stand up for them. Justine Greening remains as education secretary - her opposition to Theresa May's policy of expanding grammar schools might be less of an issue now, if, as some expect, the government is forced to drop it from the Queen's Speech to prevent a backbench revolt.

"Richard Anthony Jones (pictured right) was released because investigators found his lookalike (left) A US prisoner who spent 17 years in jail for a robbery he did not commit has spoken of his relief that researchers found his lookalike. Richard Anthony Jones from Kansas was released from jail after witnesses said they could not tell the two men apart. A judge ruled there was no evidence to keep him in jail. Mr Jones said finding a photo of the other man - who as well as looking like him, shares the same first name - was a ""needle in a haystack moment"". 'I don't believe in luck, I believe I was blessed,'Mr Jones told the Kansas City Star.,external So far no criminal case has been filed against his double - known only as Ricky - who gave evidence at Mr Jones's robbery retrial and denied committing the crime. While not saying Ricky was responsible, the judge found that based on the new evidence, no reasonable juror would have convicted Mr Jones. Mr Jones (pictured on the right) said the discovery of his lookalike was a 'needle in a haystack moment' Mr Jones said that he began to despair that he would ever be released from jail after repeated efforts to appeal against his 19-year conviction for a 1999 robbery. ""All my appeals had been denied. It has been a rough ride,"" he said. But in 2015 he told researchers from the Midwest Innocence Project - a group that aids wrongly convicted prisoners - about a man called Ricky he had heard about. Mr Jones had been told by fellow inmates that he looked identical to Ricky. ""When I saw the picture of my double it all made sense to me,"" he said. Mr Jones had been convicted based mostly on eyewitness evidence. Rape charge overturned after 24 years Why there could be many identical copies of you There was no physical, DNA or fingerprint evidence that linked him to the crime. Richard Anthony Jones celebrated with his family last week after being released from jail The researchers found that not only did the other man bear an uncanny resemblance to Mr Jones, he lived near the scene of the crime in Kansas City, Kansas, whereas Mr Jones lived across the state line in Kansas City, Missouri. Lawyers for Mr Jones also said he was with his girlfriend and her family at the time members of the public were robbed in a park. They argued that police identity procedures 17 years ago were deeply flawed. A lawyer working on his case said the team were ""floored by how much"" Mr Jones and his double looked alike. Mr Jones told the Kansas City Star that he was now adjusting to life outside of jail and was happy to be back with his children.

"Balloon syndrome is caused by gas collecting underneath the skin, often as the result of a traumatic event or infection A hedgehog ""blown up like a beach ball"" has been rescued and diagnosed with a severe case of balloon syndrome. The animal, which had inflated to twice its size, was spotted wandering around in circles by a member of the public in Toll Bar, Doncaster. RSPCA inspector Sandra Dransfield said it was clear the animal was suffering the rare condition, which is caused by gas collecting under the skin. The male hedgehog is being treated at an RSPCA centre in Cheshire. Ms Dransfield said: ""It's the worst case of balloon syndrome I've seen. ""This poor chap was almost twice its natural size, literally blown up like a beach ball with incredibly taut skin. ""I took the stricken animal straight to Peak Vets in Sheffield, where he was X-rayed and they released some of the air from under his skin. ""The vet then started him on a course of antibiotics and pain relief. We found him in the nick of time, and I really do hope he pulls through."" More news from across Yorkshire The hedgehog had inflated to twice its natural size An RSPCA spokesperson said balloon syndrome can be caused by a traumatic event, like an injury, or underlying infection, which releases gas into the cavity under the hedgehog's skin. Treatment requires the skin to be punctured and a course of medication. The large 1kg (2.2lb) hedgehog has been transferred to the RSPCA's Stapeley Grange Wildlife Centre in Nantwich, Cheshire, where he will be thoroughly examined under general anaesthetic and more air released. He will be cared for at the centre until he is ready to be returned to the wild.

"This video can not be played Passenger Richard Peters: ""They looked like regular guys"" Three British men who were detained in Germany after their conversations on board an Easyjet flight sparked alarm have been released without charge. Their flight from Slovenia to the UK was diverted to Cologne after the pilot was alerted to a ""suspicious conversation"" with ""terrorist content"". ""The criminal investigation against them has been halted. No evidence was found,"" police said. ""We now believe that there was never any real danger."" All 151 passengers were evacuated from the Airbus 319 aircraft using emergency slides, and nine received medical treatment. The men, aged 31, 38 and 48, were returning to Stansted, in Essex, from Ljubljana on 10 June when the disruption arose. They are said to have been on a business trip. According to prosecutors,the flight was diverted when fellow passengers reported the men were discussing ""terrorist matters""and carrying a book entitled ""Kill"" with a sniper rifle on the cover. They said the contents of the alleged conversation could not be verified. No explosives were found in the passengers' luggage or on the plane. A backpack belonging to the men was nonetheless blown up by police. This video can not be played Passengers exited down the emergency slides TheGerman tabloid newspaper Bild said,externalpassengers told airline staff they had heard the men using the words ""bomb"" and ""explosive"", and said one was carrying a suspicious rucksack. A spokesman for Cologne-Bonn airport said: ""The pilot had been informed about a suspicious conversation on board, after which he decided to make an unscheduled landing in Cologne-Bonn. ""After the safe landing... the 151 passengers left the [aircraft] via emergency slides and were taken to a transit gate."" The diverted plane landed in Stansted airport on Sunday. Cockpit threat suspect tackled by 'heroes' Australia plane evacuated over toilet note Passenger Daniel Noonan told the BBC that armed police entered the aircraft and escorted two men off. The third was led away on the tarmac after the passengers had exited via the slides. Passenger Richard Peters said he saw the two Asian men being handcuffed on the tarmac at Cologne-Bonn airport. He added that people on the flight were quarantined for about nine hours while police interviewed passengers about the men. He said: ""To be fair spirits were quite high considering what had happened. ""In the current climate you have to take everything seriously. My suspicion is it was, hopefully, nothing sinister. But you have to take everything seriously. ""The right thing was done."" Nine people received medical treatment after using the slides on the Airbus 319 Another passenger, Dave Hargreaves, said: ""In the flight I didn't see the suspects at all. But I noticed quite a bit of activity, with aircrew popping into the cockpit repeatedly. And a slower than normal serving of the food and drink service. ""Then at our cruising altitude I was surprised to see the air brakes go up on the wings and us start a rather speedy descent. It wasn't until perhaps 10 minutes later that we were told 'due to operational reasons' we would be diverting to Cologne airport."" Easyjet said the captain had taken the decision to land as a precaution to allow additional security checks to take place.

"Theresa May announces judge-led public inquiry into Grenfell Tower tragedy MPs now quizzing minister about response to the tragedy Queen's Speech to take place on Wednesday 21 June Tim Farron is to step down as Lib Dem leader MPs being sworn in to the House of Commons Deal between Tories and DUP delayed because of the tragedy Emma Griffiths Theresa May reshuffles her cabinet after the departures of Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon. What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda. Here's a round-up of the latest developments on this and other political stories today: The Lib Dems have warned the Conservatives they ""cannot go from weak and wobbly to business as usual"" after the government announced formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday. Lib Dem MP Alistair
Carmichael said: If the government cannot even secure a deal with the DUP, how on earth can they get a deal with the EU? Theresa May must immediately create a cross-party joint cabinet committee to negotiate Brexit. It is the only way to unite the country and strengthen our bargaining power with the EU.â  BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams says his party will oppose any pact between the UK government and the DUP ""that undermines the Good Friday Agreement"". He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said. Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay.

"The White House and Downing Street have denied US President Donald Trump wants to delay his state visit to the UK. It comes after the Guardian reported,externalMr Trump called Prime Minister Theresa May to say he did not want to visit until he had support from the British public. US administration officials have, however, told the BBC the president ""does not feel like"" visiting the UK any time soon. Mr Trump was invited for the state visit by the Queen. Downing Street says there has been ""no change"" to his planned trip. Mr Trump came in for criticism after attacking London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his response to the recent terror attacks. Mr Khan had told the public they should not be alarmed at the increased police presence on the streets after the attacks on London Bridge and at Borough Market. But Mr Trump then accused himvia Twitter,externalof making ""pathetic excuses"". A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We aren't going to comment on speculation about the contents of private phone conversations. ""The Queen extended an invitation to President Trump to visit the UK and there is no change to those plans."" The Guardian reported that, according to a Downing Street adviser who was in the room, Mr Trump made a call in recent weeks in which he stated his reservations about the visit. Mrs May is reported to have been surprised by Mr Trump's position. A senior official in the White House told the BBC that ""the president has tremendous respect for Prime Minister May"" and that the subject of the state visit ""never came up on the call"". Following the Guardian article, Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn posted a message on Twitter,,externalwelcoming the ""cancellation"" of the visit. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Trump was ""clearly terrified of the British public"". He added: ""He knows that the British people find his politics appalling and that they won't be scared to make their views known. ""Theresa May should be embarrassed that she was so quick to offer Trump a state visit. Now neither of them want to be seen with the other."" Mr Trump's own Twitter account,,externalthrough which he regularly makes announcements, has not made any recent mention of the UK state visit. The people v Trump: Do Brits back him?

"Boris Johnson was among those to leap to the prime minister's defence Senior cabinet ministers have pledged their support for the prime minister in the wake of Friday's election result. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Theresa May was the ""best placed person"" to lead the country through Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he had ""absolute faith"" in the PM. Earlier, former Chancellor George Osborne described Mrs May as ""a dead woman walking"" and said she would inevitably face a leadership challenge. Michael Gove, who has returned to the front bench as environment secretary, said it was ""vital the PM is given strong support for key Queen's Speech and Brexit talks."" Mr Osborne, now editor of the Evening Standard, said Tory MPs were ""furious"" that Mrs May had not acknowledged their losses in the general election. This video can not be played George Osborne says a leadership challenge is inevitable Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Osborne said a leadership challenge could come ""at the end of next week"". He said: ""It's just how long she is going to remain on death row."" He described Boris Johnson, who has been named as a possible challenger inthe Mail on Sunday,external, as in a ""permanent leadership campaign"". But Mr Johnson dismissed the reports, tweeting: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job."" Other Conservative MPs have predicted that the party is likely to choose a new leader after a transitional period. Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told ITV's Peston on Sunday the party needed to change leaders before the next election, saying a contest could take place over the summer. But she said: ""If we are going to have another leadership contest in the Conservative party, we cannot have another coronation like we did last summer."" Anna Soubry, former minister for small businesses, told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme she believed Mrs May would go before the end of the year. ""We don't want her to go now, we want a period of stability,"" she said. ""She is flawed, she is in a desperate situation. I think her position is untenable and I think she knows that."" But Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, told Sunday Politics that it was important for Mrs May to stay in office at a time when no other party could form a government. He said: ""It's her duty to make the best of that. It's her duty to try to offer government as resilient as it can be in quite difficult times."" And home secretary Amber Rudd said: ""I think she's an excellent leader and I hope she stays on."" Theresa May went to an early church service in Sonning with her husband Philip Turning to Brexit, the election had given more power to Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, and to Conservatives in Scotland, Mr Osborne said. He said this shift would change the debate, because the DUP were committed to avoiding a hard border with Ireland. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives,has called for a new approach to Brexit, prioritising free trade and the economy over restricting immigration. ""I don't think there is a majority now in the House of Commons for the kind of hard Brexit which is a route to political ruin for the Tory party, but more importantly is a real route to trouble for the country as a whole"", Mr Osborne said. Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Mr Osborne also revealed Mrs May's words to him when he was sacked last year. ""She said I needed to get to know my party better."" Also speaking on the Andrew Marr show,Sir Michael Fallon said Mrs May was right to call an election, and as the biggest party it was now their ""duty in the national interest"" to form a government. ""We have to get on and make the best of it. There is no other party that has any legitimacy or credibility in forming a government"", he said. The Conservatives ""fully understand what people are saying to us"" and the Prime Minister would take a more collaborative approach to government, he added. ""Clearly a minority government requires a different approach. You've already seen some changes in personnel at Number 10 Downing Street. I welcome that. ""You're going to see more collective decision-making in cabinet. I and other senior colleagues have made that clear to her,"" he said.

"Emmanuel Macron needs a strong majority to push through his reforms The centrist party of French President Emmanuel Macron looks on course to win a landslide victory following the first round of parliamentary elections. Projections show La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) and its MoDem ally set to win up to 445 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. The Socialists, France's former ruling party, are seen losing 200 seats. Traditional parties are urging voters to back Mr Macron's rivals in a run-off vote to avoid him monopolising power. Mr Macron's party was established just over a year ago and many candidates have little or no political experience. The final outcome will be decided in the second round of voting next Sunday. With all the ballots counted, Mr Macron's LREM and MoDem won 32.3% of the vote. The centre-right Republicans had 21.5%, while the far-right National Front (FN) had 13.2%, followed by the far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) on just over 11%. The Socialists, previously France's ruling party, and their allies won just 9.5%. But turnout was sharply down, at 48.7% compared with 57.2% in the first round in 2012, which analysts said reflected a sense of resignation among Mr Macron's opponents. Macron's meteoric rise What are Macron's new policies? Only four seats were settled in the first round. In the run-off vote, the other seats will be disputed by the two top-placed contenders and any other candidate who won the support of at least 12.5% of registered voters in the district. Among the LREM candidates who will compete in the second round are Marie Sara, HervÃ© Berville and CÃ©dric Villani Those include LREM candidates Marie Sara, a retired bullfighter who will compete against FN stalwart Gilbert Collard in Arles; a Rwandan refugee in Brittany, HervÃ© Berville, who will face the Republican Didier DÃ©ru; and CÃ©dric Villani, a ""mathematics evangelist"" known for his unique dress sense - including large spider brooches - who will fight against the Republican Laure Darcos. Manuel Valls, the unpopular Socialist ex-prime minister who was rejected as a candidate by both LREM and the Socialists, will face Farida Amrani, from the far-left France Unbowed, in Essonne. The election took place amid heightened security after a series of devastating terror attacks in recent years. Is Macron the anti-Trump? Can Macron's new party win majority he needs? There can be no disputing the extraordinary achievement of Emmanuel Macron. Yes, he has certainly had luck but he has also foreseen with uncanny clarity how - with the right moves at the right places at the right times - the map of French politics was waiting to be redrawn. If the projections from the first round are sustained, then the change that is about to happen to the National Assembly is as big as the one that occurred in 1958 when Charles de Gaulle brought in the Fifth Republic. Scores, hundreds, of new MPs will be arriving who have never set foot in a debating chamber of any kind, let alone the country's legislature. It is all liable to bring a rush of blood to the head, and the greatest danger right now for Macron and En Marche is hubris. The victory is no doubt spectacular but so far it has all been electoral. Phase two of the Macron master plan - actual reform - is the next challenge. And bigger. Mr Macron, 39, defeated Marine Le Pen in the presidential run-off last month. He needs a majority to push through the changes that he promised in his campaign, which include: Budget savings of â¬60bn (Â£51bn; $65bn) in the next five years Cutting the number of public servants by 120,000 Reforming the labour market and generous state pension schemes, bringing them into line with private schemes Turnout was low, despite claims that President Macron had re-energised the voting public He has already left an impression around the world, in particular for standing up to US President Donald Trump on issues like climate change. After the projections were announced, a government spokesman said voters had shown they wanted to move fast on major reforms. Macron's economic plans FranÃ§ois Baroin, head of the Republicans, said the low turnout testified to the ""deep divisions in French society"" and was ""extremely worrying"". FN leader Marine Le Pen blamed her party's poor performance on the low turnout, saying France's electoral system, which favours larger parties, needed to be reformed. FN leader Marine Le Pen said the electoral system led to low turnout ""This catastrophic abstention rate should raise the question of the voting rules which keep millions of our compatriots away from the polling stations,"" she said. Socialist leader Jean-Christophe CambadÃ©lis, who lost his seat in the first round, warned voters against giving LREM an absolute majority next Sunday. He said it would result in ""virtually no real opposition and we will have a National Assembly without any real counterbalance, without a democratic debate and not worthy of that name"". Elsewhere, German Chancellor Angela Merkel - who, like Mr Macron, has a pro-EU stance - congratulated him on the ""great success"" of his party. It was a ""vote for reforms"",tweeted,external(in German) her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. The first round saw some political heavyweights knocked out. Most of the big-name casualties were Socialists. Besides party leader CambadÃ©lis, eliminated in Paris, their ill-fated presidential candidate BenoÃ®t Hamon lost in Yvelines, just west of Paris. Other prominent Socialists knocked out included: Matthias Fekl (ex-interior minister), AurÃ©lie Filippetti (ex-culture minister) and Elisabeth Guigou (previously European affairs minister, justice minister, social affairs minister). Prominent first-round casualties (L-R): Jean-Christophe CambadÃ©lis, BenoÃ®t Hamon and Henri Guaino The ex-leader of the Greens, CÃ©cile Duflot, a former housing minister, was eliminated in Paris. Two prominent FN politicians - party campaign manager Nicolas Bay and Jean-Lin Lacapelle - were knocked out. And the big losers among the centre-right candidates were Senegalese-born Rama Yade and Henri Guaino, a former top aide to ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Guaino had fallen out with former Republican colleagues before the vote, and castigated voters in his central Paris constituency. ""The electorate... just makes me want to throw up,"" he said. He labelled them ""egotisticalbobos(bohemians)"" and conservative Catholic ""bourgeoisie"" like those who supported the Vichy French PÃ©tain regime in World War Two. What are Macron's policies?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn ""ready any time"" for another election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he can ""still be prime minister"" as he aims to thwart Theresa May's attempt to run a minority government. Hetold the Sunday Mirror,external: ""This is still on. Absolutely."" Labour will set out its own programme for government as an amendment to the Queen's Speech, focusing on austerity and a ""jobs-first Brexit,"" he says. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr he will call on MPs from all other parties to back his policies instead of Mrs May's. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told Sky News Labour are ""absolutely on our toes"" to set up an alternative minority government if Mrs May's government falls apart, accusing the Conservative PM of ""squatting in Downing Street"". Live: Corbyn among Sunday political interviewees Tories and DUP 'still in discussions' Queen's Speech test for May Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? Mrs May is seeking a loose ""confidence and supply"" arrangement with the DUP's 10 MPs that would allow her to press ahead with a minority government, after losing her Commons majority in Thursday's general election. The Conservatives could command a majority with the support of the DUP if they manage to to do a deal with the Northern Irish party. Labour gained 30 seats in Thursday's general election to take its total to 262 seats, but the Conservatives remain the largest party in Parliament with 318 seats. This is more than the total of Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party. The number needed for a majority is 326. This would give the Tories the numbers to pass a Queen's Speech on Monday 19 June, which will set out their legislative agenda. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he believes there is a majority in Parliament to maintain the winter fuel allowance and ""triple lock"" state pension guarantee, two policies the Conservatives proposed changing in their manifesto. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""I believe the DUP is in favour of scrapping the bedroom tax. There's a whole range of issues like that where we think there'll be a majority in Parliament."" Jeremy Corbyn said he did not think Mrs May had any credibility and it was ""unclear"" what kind of programme the Conservatives would be able to put forward. He said there was a ""possibility"" of voting down the Queen's Speech and Labour were going to ""push all the way"" to achieve that. Jeremy Corbyn picks up the post-election newspapers in his Islington constituency Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said Labour would put down a ""substantial amendment to the Queen's speech"" based on the main policies in its general election manifesto, with an emphasis on Brexit, young people, and austerity. He said the Brexit content of that amendment would be about negotiating as quickly as possible a ""jobs-first Brexit"". Mr Corbyn said his party was ""quite ready and able to put forward a serious programme of government"", which he said ""obviously has massive support in this country."" He also said he believed that the Great Repeal Bill - the Conservative plan to copy across all EU laws into UK law - would now become ""history"" - and that there would be ""something different"" in a few weeks' time. He told Andrew Marr he thought it was quite possible there could be an election later this year, or early next year, which he thought ""might be a good thing."" ""We can't go on with a period of great instability"" he said, adding that the Labour Party was ready to fight another election campaign. On Brexit, Mr Corbyn said he wanted ""tariff-free access to the European market"" and to maintain membership of key European agencies, as well as  European Convention on Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights but he confirmed he would press ahead with leaving the EU if he became prime minister. He also suggested he was ready to build bridges with some of the Labour MPs who have opposed his leadership. Asked if Yvette Cooper and Chuka Umunna - both of whom had been reported to be planning leadership bids if Labour lost seats in the general election - could come back to the front bench, Mr Corbyn said: ""I am the most generous person in the world."" Ms Cooper, who was defeated by Mr Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership contest, said the Parliamentary party had ""changed a lot"" since last year's EU referendum and was now fully behind Mr Corbyn. ""We all need to pull together to take on Theresa May and take on the Tories,"" she told Sky News. She did not rule out accepting a job in Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, but said she did not want to be ""presumptuous"". She said the Conservatives' planned deal with the DUP was ""dodgy"" and ""unsustainable"" - and Theresa May's position was ""not remotely tenable"" because she lacked the skills to hold together a minority government, which has to be more open and collegiate. She said Labour had to be ready for another election ""at any time"" and warned the party not to ""rest on its laurels,"" saying it had to work on how to win back more seats from the Conservatives. This video can not be played Chris Leslie told Today that Labour had been looking at ""an open goal"" In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Chris Leslie, Labour MP for Nottingham East, refused to say whether he thought Mr Corbyn was a credible prime minister. He said: ""We shouldn't pretend that this is a famous victory. It's good as far as it's gone, but it's not going to be good enough."" He said the party had missed an ""open goal"" in failing to win a majority. ""You've got to convince them of your credibility and that you can move from protesting about the government to being in government,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""[It's] a cabinet that reflects the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative Party"". A meeting of the Conservative Party's influential backbench 1922 committee - in effect all Conservative backbenchers - has been brought forward by 24 hours to 17:00 BST on Monday. This is not because of panic, but possibly as a way of suppressing it. As one MP put it: ""The wise heads will need to tell any hotheads to calm down."" The prime minister will meet her internal critics head on. Having phoned over the weekend candidates who were defeated in an election she didn't need to call, she will find that many of those who escaped that fate are cross. But widespread demands for her to go are not expected. May praises Tory 'talent' in reshuffle Six key lessons from a surprise result Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: ""It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably."" Another said: ""Party members have been too bruised by her."" ""She has bought herself some time"", said a senior backbencher, but added: ""How she behaves will determine how long she's there."" There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. ""There is zero appetite for another election,"" as one MP put it, and a feeling that, in an early poll, victory wouldn't be guaranteed. Some say Labour's digital campaign and mobilisation of young people was particularly impressive, and another election would give Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to do what he does best - campaign. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn ""ready any time"" for another election. Equally, a leadership election could be destabilising ahead of Brexit talks - though it's widely expected one will take place well before 2022. Some kind of arrangement with the DUP is seen as inevitable, but one MP cautioned ""the devil is in the detail"". One of the reasons the 1922 meeting has been moved forward is so any deal can be discussed before it is sealed. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that the most flexible of arrangements is likely to be put in place; one that would mean there would have to be negotiations with the DUP on an issue-by-issue basis. DUP deals and dialogue How will this minority government actually work? Theresa May is expected to hear strong criticisms of what one backbencher dubbed ""her miserable manifesto"". Of course, some individual policies, such as social care - ""It went down like a lead balloon"" - will be singled out, but the presentation of policy will also be attacked. MPs will say that an effective fourfold lifting of the floor on residential care costs wasn't widely understood. And a campaign which barely mentioned the economy will come under fire. ""We didn't dodge a bullet but were winged,"" said one. ""If Labour had a more credible leader we could have been in even bigger difficulties."" There has been speculation that there may now be a ""softer Brexit"", partly because of an influx of Scottish MPs who favour close trading relationships with the EU, but also because of the elevation of Damian Green to First Secretary of State. He is a friend of Mrs May's, a Remainer in the referendum campaign, and he has warned that concessions may have to be made in negotiations. But some senior Tories have told me that they will urge her to stick to her manifesto commitments on Brexit and, for them, controls on immigration and coming out of the single market are ""bottom lines"". This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon: ""Government view on Brexit unchanged"" Others will want to insist on the freedom to strike trade deals, so coming out of the customs union is seen as essential. ""We must hold our nerve on Brexit,"" said one. However, another senior backbencher recognised that it would now be inevitable that Parliament would have greater influence over the process. ""She will be walking a tightrope"", and, while MPs seem to see the necessity, in the words of one former minister, to ""shore her up in the short term"", if she stumbles, she can fall at any time.

"Guardiola addressed thousands of independence supporters at the rally Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has joined thousands of protesters in Barcelona to call for independence for the Spanish region of Catalonia. He made a strong plea for voters to take part in an independence referendum scheduled for 1 October. ""We will vote, even if the Spanish state doesn't want it,"" Guardiola told the crowd. ""There is no other way."" Surveys suggest Catalan voters would narrowly reject independence, though most favour holding a referendum. On Friday, Catalonia regional government leader Carles Puigdemont decided to hold the vote later this year, in defiance of the government and contravening a ruling by Spain's Constitutional Court. It is not clear if the referendum will go ahead. Catalonia is gearing up for an independence vote in October Guardiola - who is revered in Catalonia for his footballing achievements - also demanded international help against ""the abuses of an authoritarian state"" at the rally. Local authorities say that about 30,000 people attended, but a separatist source put the figure closer to 47,000. Catalonia plans October independence vote defying Spain Will Catalonia try to secede from Spain this year? The latest polls suggest that most Catalans support the holding of a referendum similar to the one held by Scotland in 2014  - the main difference being that the Scottish vote had the support of the British government. Guardiola told the crowd that nothing would stop Catalans from voting Polls indicate a tight race, with 48.5% of respondents opposing independence, and 44.3% in favour. In 2014, Catalonia held a non-binding vote in which peopleoverwhelmingly backed independence. But on that occasion only about 2.3 million out of an electorate of about 5.4 million took part. Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest areas and has its own distinctive language and customs. Guardiola has spent most of his career with Barcelona, winning the club's first European Cup in 1992, and four La Liga titles. He has been captain and manager of the team.

"Boris Johnson was among those to leap to the prime minister's defence Senior cabinet ministers have pledged their support for the prime minister in the wake of Friday's election result. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Theresa May was the ""best placed person"" to lead the country through Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he had ""absolute faith"" in the PM. Earlier, former Chancellor George Osborne described Mrs May as ""a dead woman walking"" and said she would inevitably face a leadership challenge. Michael Gove, who has returned to the front bench as environment secretary, said it was ""vital the PM is given strong support for key Queen's Speech and Brexit talks."" Mr Osborne, now editor of the Evening Standard, said Tory MPs were ""furious"" that Mrs May had not acknowledged their losses in the general election. This video can not be played George Osborne says a leadership challenge is inevitable Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Osborne said a leadership challenge could come ""at the end of next week"". He said: ""It's just how long she is going to remain on death row."" He described Boris Johnson, who has been named as a possible challenger inthe Mail on Sunday,external, as in a ""permanent leadership campaign"". But Mr Johnson dismissed the reports, tweeting: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa may. Let's get on with the job."" Other Conservative MPs have predicted that the party is likely to choose a new leader after a transitional period. Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told ITV's Peston on Sunday the party needed to change leaders before the next election, saying a contest could take place over the summer. But she said: ""If we are going to have another leadership contest in the Conservative party, we cannot have another coronation like we did last summer."" Anna Soubry, former minister for small businesses, told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme she believed Mrs May would go before the end of the year. ""We don't want her to go now, we want a period of stability,"" she said. ""She is flawed, she is in a desperate situation. I think her position is untenable and I think she knows that."" But Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, told Sunday Politics that it was important for Mrs May to stay in office at a time when no other party could form a government. He said: ""It's her duty to make the best of that. It's her duty to try to offer government as resilient as it can be in quite difficult times."" And home secretary Amber Rudd said: ""I think she's an excellent leader and I hope she stays on."" Theresa May went to an early church service in Sonning with her husband Philip Turning to Brexit, the election had given more power to Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, and to Conservatives in Scotland, Mr Osborne said. He said this shift would change the debate, because the DUP were committed to avoiding a hard border with Ireland. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives,has called for a new approach to Brexit, prioritising free trade and the economy over restricting immigration. ""I don't think there is a majority now in the House of Commons for the kind of hard Brexit which is a route to political ruin for the Tory party, but more importantly is a real route to trouble for the country as a whole"", Mr Osborne said. Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Mr Osborne also revealed Mrs May's words to him when he was sacked last year. ""She said I needed to get to know my party better."" Also speaking on the Andrew Marr show,Sir Michael Fallon said Mrs May was right to call an election, and as the biggest party it was now their ""duty in the national interest"" to form a government. ""We have to get on and make the best of it. There is no other party that has any legitimacy or credibility in forming a government"", he said. The Conservatives ""fully understand what people are saying to us"" and the Prime Minister would take a more collaborative approach to government, he added. ""Clearly a minority government requires a different approach. You've already seen some changes in personnel at Number 10 Downing Street. I welcome that. ""You're going to see more collective decision-making in cabinet. I and other senior colleagues have made that clear to her,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Putting together a Cabinet that reflects the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative party."" Theresa May said the government planned to focus on social issues and ""delivering a successful Brexit"", as she completed a Cabinet reshuffle. The PM said the new line-up brought in ""talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party"". Her comments came after Michael Gove, one of the driving forces behind Brexit, returned to the front bench as environment secretary. She said it was a ""government that's going to be governing for everyone"". Damian Green has been made first secretary of state in the reshuffle. The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of the PM, her second in command. When asked if she had brought back Mr Gove - seen by some as an adversary - after being left weakened by the snap election result, Mrs May said her reshuffle had ""seen people from across the party accepting the invitation to be in my cabinet"". ""Crucially I've brought in talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party. We want a country that works for everyone."" She said she had appointed ""a cabinet that will get on with the job of government"". ""That's about delivering a successful Brexit negotiations. And those negotiations start in a week's time."" Mrs May also said the government would be tackling issues such as the Brexit negotiations, and such issues as education, ""dealing for the need for more housing"" and a ""proper mental health legislation that is going to support people"". And when asked if she would continue in office, she replied: ""I said during the election campaign if re-elected, I would serve a full term."" Mr Gove told Sky News he was ""quite surprised"" to be asked to join the cabinet. ""Of course I knew that today was re-shuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa."" The previous Environment Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been appointed as the Leader of the House in the Commons. Most other ministers have kept their roles -  but Liz Truss is moved from justice to chief Treasury secretary. Commons Leader David Lidington takes over as justice secretary and lord chancellor. Chief Treasury Secretary David Gauke has been appointed work and pensions secretary. Michael Gove was not given a Cabinet position when Mrs May assumed the role of PM last year Mrs May had been expected to carry out a widespread reshuffle of her top team after Thursday's general election but her room for manoeuvre has been limited by her failure to win an overall majority. Most of the cabinet jobs remain unchanged: Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Secretary of State for the Home Department - Amber Rudd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs - Boris Johnson Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union - David Davis Secretary of State for Defence - Michael Fallon Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley International development - Priti Patel Transport - Chris Grayling Business - Greg Clark Damian Green, who was previously work and pensions secretary and was at university with Mrs May, has also become minister for the Cabinet Office, a position left vacant by Ben Gummer, who lost his seat in Thursday's general election. The first secretary of state is a role previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson and could see Mr Green standing in for Theresa May at prime minister's questions when she is not available. The role is periodically used by UK governments and did not exist in Mrs May's first cabinet, formed after she became prime minister in July last year. It does not come with a government department but does give its holder seniority over other cabinet ministers and is seen as being similar to the role of deputy prime minister. Andrea Leadsom takes over from David Lidington Boris Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades. ""I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."" According to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin, some green campaigners have reservations over Mr Gove's appointment. Tom Burke, from the think tank e3g, told the BBC: ""The environment is something young voters really care about. ""If the Tories really want to reconnect with the youth surge, this is about the worst option they could have chosen."" But a senior farming source said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had ""long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who's being put out to grass"". In the latest fallout from the general election result, which confounded pollsters and left the UK with ahung Parliament: An influential Conservative MP predicted Tory manifesto policies including on grammar schools would have to be ""slimmed down"" Mrs May was accused of putting her party interest above the Northern Ireland peace process with the planned DUP alliance Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be PMand would try to amend the Queen's Speech Former Tory Chancellor George Osbornedescribed Mrs Mayas a ""dead woman walking"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mrs May would have to adopt a more ""collective"" approach to making decisions Pro-EU Conservativespredictedthe outcome of the general election would change the government's approach to Brexit Liz Truss was criticised for not standing up for judges involved in a Brexit court case Liam Fox retains his position as international trade secretary - he told reporters he was ""delighted"" to be continuing in the role he has held since July last year. ""It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."" Liz Truss's change of position will be seen by some as a demotion - she was widely criticised by the judiciary following the High Court ruling regarding the government seeking Parliament's permission to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal start of the Brexit process. The judges involved were heavily criticised by some newspapers, and Mrs Truss was in turn criticised for failing to stand up for them. Justine Greening remains as education secretary - her opposition to Theresa May's policy of expanding grammar schools might be less of an issue now, if, as some expect, the government is forced to drop it from the Queen's Speech to prevent a backbench revolt.

"Emmanuel Macron needs a strong majority to push through his reforms The centrist party of French President Emmanuel Macron looks on course to win a landslide victory following the first round of parliamentary elections. Projections show La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move) and its MoDem ally set to win up to 445 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. The Socialists, France's former ruling party, are seen losing 200 seats. Traditional parties are urging voters to back Mr Macron's rivals in a run-off vote to avoid him monopolising power. Mr Macron's party was established just over a year ago and many candidates have little or no political experience. The final outcome will be decided in the second round of voting next Sunday. With all the ballots counted, Mr Macron's LREM and MoDem won 32.3% of the vote. The centre-right Republicans had 21.5%, while the far-right National Front (FN) had 13.2%, followed by the far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) on just over 11%. The Socialists, previously France's ruling party, and their allies won just 9.5%. But turnout was sharply down, at 48.7% compared with 57.2% in the first round in 2012, which analysts said reflected a sense of resignation among Mr Macron's opponents. Macron's meteoric rise What are Macron's new policies? Only four seats were settled in the first round. In the run-off vote, the other seats will be disputed by the two top-placed contenders and any other candidate who won the support of at least 12.5% of registered voters in the district. Among the LREM candidates who will compete in the second round are Marie Sara, HervÃ© Berville and CÃ©dric Villani Those include LREM candidates Marie Sara, a retired bullfighter who will compete against FN stalwart Gilbert Collard in Arles; a Rwandan refugee in Brittany, HervÃ© Berville, who will face the Republican Didier DÃ©ru; and CÃ©dric Villani, a ""mathematics evangelist"" known for his unique dress sense - including large spider brooches - who will fight against the Republican Laure Darcos. Manuel Valls, the unpopular Socialist ex-prime minister who was rejected as a candidate by both LREM and the Socialists, will face Farida Amrani, from the far-left France Unbowed, in Essonne. The election took place amid heightened security after a series of devastating terror attacks in recent years. Is Macron the anti-Trump? Can Macron's new party win majority he needs? There can be no disputing the extraordinary achievement of Emmanuel Macron. Yes, he has certainly had luck but he has also foreseen with uncanny clarity how - with the right moves at the right places at the right times - the map of French politics was waiting to be redrawn. If the projections from the first round are sustained, then the change that is about to happen to the National Assembly is as big as the one that occurred in 1958 when Charles de Gaulle brought in the Fifth Republic. Scores, hundreds, of new MPs will be arriving who have never set foot in a debating chamber of any kind, let alone the country's legislature. It is all liable to bring a rush of blood to the head, and the greatest danger right now for Macron and En Marche is hubris. The victory is no doubt spectacular but so far it has all been electoral. Phase two of the Macron master plan - actual reform - is the next challenge. And bigger. Mr Macron, 39, defeated Marine Le Pen in the presidential run-off last month. He needs a majority to push through the changes that he promised in his campaign, which include: Budget savings of â¬60bn (Â£51bn; $65bn) in the next five years Cutting the number of public servants by 120,000 Reforming the labour market and generous state pension schemes, bringing them into line with private schemes Turnout was low, despite claims that President Macron had re-energised the voting public He has already left an impression around the world, in particular for standing up to US President Donald Trump on issues like climate change. After the projections were announced, a government spokesman said voters had shown they wanted to move fast on major reforms. Macron's economic plans FranÃ§ois Baroin, head of the Republicans, said the low turnout testified to the ""deep divisions in French society"" and was ""extremely worrying"". FN leader Marine Le Pen blamed her party's poor performance on the low turnout, saying France's electoral system, which favours larger parties, needed to be reformed. FN leader Marine Le Pen said the electoral system led to low turnout ""This catastrophic abstention rate should raise the question of the voting rules which keep millions of our compatriots away from the polling stations,"" she said. Socialist leader Jean-Christophe CambadÃ©lis, who lost his seat in the first round, warned voters against giving LREM an absolute majority next Sunday. He said it would result in ""virtually no real opposition and we will have a National Assembly without any real counterbalance, without a democratic debate and not worthy of that name"". Elsewhere, German Chancellor Angela Merkel - who, like Mr Macron, has a pro-EU stance - congratulated him on the ""great success"" of his party. It was a ""vote for reforms"",tweeted,external(in German) her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. The first round saw some political heavyweights knocked out. Most of the big-name casualties were Socialists. Besides party leader CambadÃ©lis, eliminated in Paris, their ill-fated presidential candidate BenoÃ®t Hamon lost in Yvelines, just west of Paris. Other prominent Socialists knocked out included: Matthias Fekl (ex-interior minister), AurÃ©lie Filippetti (ex-culture minister) and Elisabeth Guigou (previously European affairs minister, justice minister, social affairs minister). Prominent first-round casualties (L-R): Jean-Christophe CambadÃ©lis, BenoÃ®t Hamon and Henri Guaino The ex-leader of the Greens, CÃ©cile Duflot, a former housing minister, was eliminated in Paris. Two prominent FN politicians - party campaign manager Nicolas Bay and Jean-Lin Lacapelle - were knocked out. And the big losers among the centre-right candidates were Senegalese-born Rama Yade and Henri Guaino, a former top aide to ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Guaino had fallen out with former Republican colleagues before the vote, and castigated voters in his central Paris constituency. ""The electorate... just makes me want to throw up,"" he said. He labelled them ""egotisticalbobos(bohemians)"" and conservative Catholic ""bourgeoisie"" like those who supported the Vichy French PÃ©tain regime in World War Two. What are Macron's policies?

"Enda Kenny sought assurances that ""nothing should happen to put the Good Friday Agreement at risk"" The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), Enda Kenny, has called Theresa May to express his concern over apossible deal between her party and the DUP. He sought assurances that ""nothing should happen to put the Good Friday Agreement at risk"". A spokesperson from Number 10 said both leaders spoke on the phone on Sunday. They said Mrs May and Mr Kenny had ""confirmed their joint commitment to restoring the Northern Ireland Executive as soon as possible"". ""The Prime Minister reiterated that the government's approach and objectives in the forthcoming talks to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive remained unchanged,"" they said. Who are the DUP Can a Conservative and DUP pact work? Warning DUP deal 'risks peace process' Read analysis from BBC News NI Political Editor Mark Devenport The DUP leader Arlene Foster said good progress had been made in talks with the Conservatives, but a deal is yet to be reached. Arlene Foster with Lord Morrow and her ten DUP MPs at a press conference on Friday Mrs Foster and her ten DUP MPs are due to meet with Theresa May on Tuesday. Earlier, some of Northern Ireland's other parties expressed concern that a deal between the Conservatives and the DUP could hamper power sharing at Stormont. Talks aimed at restoring the executive resume on Monday and all five main parties have said they will be there. The five main Northern Ireland parties have said they will resume talks on Monday The DUP has indicated its potential role at Westminster does not change its desire to restore power sharing. They say they remain ready to form an executive without preconditions. But the other Stormont parties have warned that any deal between the DUP and Conservatives could make restoring power sharing more difficult. Devolved government in Northern Ireland broke down in January. The late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness,stood down to protest the DUP's handling of an energy scandal, in a move that triggered a snap election. Sinn FÃ©in want a new chairperson for the talks at Stormont Former Sinn FÃ©in finance minister MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir said the government would now be ""dancing to the DUP's tune"". SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon also said Mr Brokenshire could not be considered ""an honest broker"". She said the situation had been difficult before, but had got even worse. ""How can you have a secretary of state sitting as an honest broker when they already have a deal with one of the parties sitting around the table?"" she asked. The Alliance Party's Stephen Farry said: ""There's now a massive problem, he cannot be an impartial broker. Stephen Farry has also called for a new chair for the talks ""The government will have one hand behind its back and if it tells the DUP to agree to something it doesn't want to then the DUP will pull the plug and the whole thing will come crashing down. ""We cannot stop them from making this deal, but the repercussions for Northern Ireland are potentially severe."" The UUP's Danny Kennedy said the other parties would have to ""wake up"" and accept the situation. ""The UUP will be at Stormont tomorrow,"" he said. Danny Kennedy said the UUP would be at the talks on Monday ""That's what people want. ""The secretary of state and indeed the prime minister have made no secret of their own unionist views. They support the union and we welcome that."" No one from the DUP was available to appear on the Sunday Politics programme.

"Theresa May announces judge-led public inquiry into Grenfell Tower tragedy MPs now quizzing minister about response to the tragedy Queen's Speech to take place on Wednesday 21 June Tim Farron is to step down as Lib Dem leader MPs being sworn in to the House of Commons Deal between Tories and DUP delayed because of the tragedy Emma Griffiths Theresa May reshuffles her cabinet after the departures of Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon. What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry.

Lib Dem MP Alistair
Carmichael said: If the government cannot even secure a deal with the DUP, how on earth can they get a deal with the EU? Theresa May must immediately create a cross-party joint cabinet committee to negotiate Brexit. It is the only way to unite the country and strengthen our bargaining power with the EU.â  BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams says his party will oppose any pact between the UK government and the DUP ""that undermines the Good Friday Agreement"". He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said. Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"Adam West, left, and Burt Ward drew a cult following for their tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the Dynamic Duo Actor Burt Ward, who played Robin alongside Adam West's Batman in the hit 1960s TV series, has paid tribute to his co-star who has died aged 88. Ward, 71, told the BBC that the two had enjoyed ""an amazing friendship"", describing the actor as ""a lot of fun"". He said they had played the Dynamic Duo ""on multiple levels"" to please the show's varied audience. West died in Los Angeles on Friday after a short battle with leukaemia, his family said. The TV series, with its kitsch costumes, comic book fight scenes and corny one-liners, drew a cult following. Tributes to West have flooded in from the acting world and also from thousands of fans. ""This is a wonderful man who I've spent 75% of the time on this earth working with, who has been a pleasure, just amazing talent, a great father, a great family man, a wonderful human being, just a lot of fun and I'm going to miss him incredibly. In fact it's very difficult to really believe that the end has come,"" Ward told BBC Radio 5 Live. Listen: Catwoman mourns death of Batman Listen: Burt Ward pays tribute to Adam West ""Adam and I have had the most amazing friendship, just for whatever reason we instantly got along. ""We share a similar type of humour, we had the best time on Batman and it really showed through."" Batman stars Burt Ward, Adam West, and Julie Newmar appeared together on stage in 2014 Ward said he and West knew the show was being enjoyed by all age groups. ""We were playing it on multiple levels, we were playing with our audience, we used to say that we put on our tights to 'put on' the world."" He added: ""For the kids it was serious hero worship, for the adults it's the nostalgia, the comic book, and for that very difficult audience at that time to capture - the teenagers and the college kids - it was the insinuations, the double entendres, all the things that nobody had ever done with an audience."" Fellow actor Julie Newmar, who played the Caped Crusader's arch enemy Catwoman, described West as ""stellar, exemplary, he was a king to the end"". ""He was bright, witty and fun to work with. And I'll miss him in the physical world and savour him always in the world of imagination and creativity,"" she told the BBC World Service. ""Adam West was the best Batman of all time. I don't think there'll be one to compare with him. He was, of course, the original, but still all in all the best, not only for that time but for all time."" Flowers were left on Adam's West's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame On Saturday, actor Val Kilmer, who played Batman in a later movie, tweeted: ""Ah dear Adam West. He was always so kind when we met. A real gent. Once when I was a kid we found ourselves in front the Batmobile. I got in."" After the TV series and a Batman movie in which he also starred, West struggled to find big acting roles. However, he won a new generation of fans in more recent times after joining the cast of the animated comedy series Family Guy. He voiced Quahog's eccentric Mayor Adam West, described by series creator Seth MacFarlane as an ""alternate universe"", satirised version of the actor.

"This video can not be played Passenger Richard Peters: ""They looked like regular guys"" A plane flying from Slovenia to the UK made an unplanned landing after the pilot was alerted to a ""suspicious conversation"" with ""terrorist content"". Three British men arrested after the Easyjet flight from Ljubljana to Stansted, in Essex, was diverted to Germany's Cologne-Bonn airport on Saturday are being questioned. All 151 passengers were evacuated and flights were suspended for three hours. A backpack belonging to the men was blown up by police. A spokesman for Cologne-Bonn airport said: ""The pilot had been informed about a suspicious conversation on board, after which he decided to make an unscheduled landing in Cologne-Bonn. ""After the safe landing... the 151 passengers left the [aircraft] via emergency slides and were taken to a transit gate."" Nine people received medical treatment after using the slides on the Airbus 319. A statement from Cologne police said other passengers had made the crew aware of a conversation by three men. It said the subject had been ""terrorist content"", without elaborating further. Easyjet said the captain had taken the decision to land as a precaution to allow additional security checks to take place. Nine people received medical treatment after using the slides on the Airbus 319 The diverted plane landed in London Stansted airport on Sunday. Passenger Daniel Noonan told the BBC that armed police entered the aircraft and escorted two men off. The third was led away on the tarmac after the passengers had exited via the slides. Passenger Richard Peters said he saw the two Asian men being handcuffed on the tarmac at Cologne-Bonn airport. He added that people on the flight were quarantined for about nine hours while police interviewed passengers about the men. He said: ""To be fair spirits were quite high considering what had happened. ""In the current climate you have to take everything seriously. My suspicion is it was, hopefully, nothing sinister. But you have to take everything seriously. ""The right thing was done."" Another passenger, Dave Hargreaves, said: ""In the flight I didn't see the suspects at all. But I noticed quite a bit of activity, with aircrew popping into the cockpit repeatedly. And a slower than normal serving of the food and drink service. ""Then at our cruising altitude I was surprised to see the air brakes go up on the wings and us start a rather speedy descent. It wasn't until perhaps 10 minutes later that we were told 'due to operational reasons' we would be diverting to Cologne airport."" A backpack belonging to the men was ""blown up in a controlled manner"", police said. No explosives were found in the passengers' luggage or on the plane. The men are aged 31, 38 and 48, a Cologne police spokesman said. It is unclear if charges will be brought. The Bild newspaper said the men worked for a London firm and were returning from a business trip. All the other passengers were given a hotel for the night, an Easyjet spokeswoman said, adding: ""We thank passengers for their understanding.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Putting together a Cabinet that reflects the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative party."" Theresa May said the government planned to focus on social issues and ""delivering a successful Brexit"", as she completed a Cabinet reshuffle. The PM said the new line-up brought in ""talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party"". Her comments came after Michael Gove, one of the driving forces behind Brexit, returned to the front bench as environment secretary. She said it was a ""government that's going to be governing for everyone"". Damian Green has been made first secretary of state in the reshuffle. The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of the PM, her second in command. When asked if she had brought back Mr Gove - seen by some as an adversary - after being left weakened by the snap election result, Mrs May said her reshuffle had ""seen people from across the party accepting the invitation to be in my cabinet"". ""Crucially I've brought in talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party. We want a country that works for everyone."" She said she had appointed ""a cabinet that will get on with the job of government"". ""That's about delivering a successful Brexit negotiations. And those negotiations start in a week's time."" Mrs May also said the government would be tackling issues such as the Brexit negotiations, and such issues as education, ""dealing for the need for more housing"" and a ""proper mental health legislation that is going to support people"". And when asked if she would continue in office, she replied: ""I said during the election campaign if re-elected, I would serve a full term."" Mr Gove told Sky News he was ""quite surprised"" to be asked to join the cabinet. ""Of course I knew that today was re-shuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa."" The previous Environment Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been appointed as the Leader of the House in the Commons. Most other ministers have kept their roles -  but Liz Truss is moved from justice to chief Treasury secretary. Commons Leader David Lidington takes over as justice secretary and lord chancellor. Chief Treasury Secretary David Gauke has been appointed work and pensions secretary. Michael Gove was not given a Cabinet position when Mrs May assumed the role of PM last year Mrs May had been expected to carry out a widespread reshuffle of her top team after Thursday's general election but her room for manoeuvre has been limited by her failure to win an overall majority. Most of the cabinet jobs remain unchanged: Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Secretary of State for the Home Department - Amber Rudd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs - Boris Johnson Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union - David Davis Secretary of State for Defence - Michael Fallon Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley International development - Priti Patel Transport - Chris Grayling Business - Greg Clark Damian Green, who was previously work and pensions secretary and was at university with Mrs May, has also become minister for the Cabinet Office, a position left vacant by Ben Gummer, who lost his seat in Thursday's general election. The first secretary of state is a role previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson and could see Mr Green standing in for Theresa May at prime minister's questions when she is not available. The role is periodically used by UK governments and did not exist in Mrs May's first cabinet, formed after she became prime minister in July last year. It does not come with a government department but does give its holder seniority over other cabinet ministers and is seen as being similar to the role of deputy prime minister. Andrea Leadsom takes over from David Lidington Boris Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades. ""I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."" According to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin, some green campaigners have reservations over Mr Gove's appointment. Tom Burke, from the think tank e3g, told the BBC: ""The environment is something young voters really care about. ""If the Tories really want to reconnect with the youth surge, this is about the worst option they could have chosen."" But a senior farming source said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had ""long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who's being put out to grass"". In the latest fallout from the general election result, which confounded pollsters and left the UK with ahung Parliament: An influential Conservative MP predicted Tory manifesto policies including on grammar schools would have to be ""slimmed down"" Mrs May was accused of putting her party interest above the Northern Ireland peace process with the planned DUP alliance Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be PMand would try to amend the Queen's Speech Former Tory Chancellor George Osbornedescribed Mrs Mayas a ""dead woman walking"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mrs May would have to adopt a more ""collective"" approach to making decisions Pro-EU Conservativespredictedthe outcome of the general election would change the government's approach to Brexit Liz Truss was criticised for not standing up for judges involved in a Brexit court case Liam Fox retains his position as international trade secretary - he told reporters he was ""delighted"" to be continuing in the role he has held since July last year. ""It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."" Liz Truss's change of position will be seen by some as a demotion - she was widely criticised by the judiciary following the High Court ruling regarding the government seeking Parliament's permission to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal start of the Brexit process. The judges involved were heavily criticised by some newspapers, and Mrs Truss was in turn criticised for failing to stand up for them. Justine Greening remains as education secretary - her opposition to Theresa May's policy of expanding grammar schools might be less of an issue now, if, as some expect, the government is forced to drop it from the Queen's Speech to prevent a backbench revolt.

"A supermarket in Doha, Qatar. Iran Air says deliveries will continue ""as long as there is demand"" Iran has sent five planeloads of food to Qatar, which is suffering shortages amid a regional blockade. A number of nations, including Iran's major rival Saudi Arabia, last week cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of funding terrorism, charges it denies. The land border with Saudi Arabia, through which 40% of Qatar's food comes, has been closed. Meanwhile, mediators Kuwait said that Qatar was ready to listen to the ""qualms"" of its neighbours. All you need to know about Qatar What's behind the row? A spokesman for Iran Air, Shahrokh Noushabadi, told the Agence France-Presse news agency on Sunday: ""So far five planes carrying perishable food items such as fruit and vegetables have been sent to Qatar, each carrying around 90 tonnes of cargo, while another plane will be sent today."" It is unclear whether the food is an aid delivery or a commercial transaction. Mr Noushabadi said deliveries would continue ""as long as there is demand"". AFP also quoted the Tasnim news agency as reporting that three ships with 350 tonnes of food were also set to leave for Qatar. The view from Doha Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis? Iran has also opened its airspace to Qatari flights, following airspace closures by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Analysts say Qatar's positive relations with Shia-led Iran - Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia's arch-rival for influence in the region - were one of the causes of the latest rift, and the latest shipments are unlikely to ease the tension. Kuwait has taken on the role of mediator, last week sending its emir to Saudi Arabia. On Sunday, Kuwait's Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah said Qatar was ready ""to understand the reality of the qualms and concerns of their brothers and to heed the noble endeavours to enhance security and stability"". UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted: ""Is this the beginning of wisdom and reasonable thinking? I hope so."" Qatar separately said it would not retaliate with similar measures after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE last week ordered all Qatari citizens to leave within 14 days. Some 11,000 people from the three nations are believed to be in Qatar. In other developments on Sunday: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE have set up hotlines to help families in their countries that have Qatari members.

"This video can not be played Sir Michael Fallon said the Tories did not have to agree with the DUP's views on social issues A Conservative deal with the Democratic Unionist Party would only apply to ""big issues"" like the economy and security, the defence secretary has said. Sir Michael Fallon said the parties were seeking an agreement - which would not be a formal coalition - to keep a minority Tory government in power. Speaking to Andrew Marr, Sir Michael also distanced himself from the DUP's conservative stance on social issues. ""It doesn't mean we now agree with all their views,"" he said. Live: Reaction to Sunday's political interviews DUP deal 'may hamper power-sharing talks' Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? 'May is a dead woman walking' DUP leader Arlene Foster is expected to hold talks in Downing Street on Tuesday with Prime Minister Theresa May. Mrs May is under pressure after losing the Tories' Commons majority in Thursday's general election. Theresa May and her husband attended church, as arguments over a deal with the DUP continue In the latest fallout from the result, which confounded pollsters and left the UK with ahung Parliament: An influential Conservative MP predicted Tory manifesto policies including on grammar schools would have to be ""slimmed down"" Mrs May was accused of putting her party interest above the Northern Ireland peace process with the planned DUP alliance Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be PMand would try to amend the Queen's Speech Former Tory Chancellor George Osbornedescribed Mrs Mayas a ""dead woman walking"" Mr Fallon said Mrs May would have to adopt a more ""collective"" approach to making decisions Pro-EU Conservativespredictedthe outcome of the general election would change the government's approach to Brexit Overnight there was confusion over the status of an agreement with the DUP, with Downing Street initially saying the principles had been agreed before issuing another statement saying negotiations continued. The DUP  were as ""surprised as anybody"" by Downing Street's original announcement, the BBC understands. ""It would be very, very surprising if something as important and complex as this was stitched together in a single day of talks in Belfast,"" Sir Michael said. Ms Foster told Sky News ""discussions continue"" about forming a ""national government"" to bring stability to the nation. This video can not be played George Osborne: ""Theresa May is a dead woman walking, it's just how long she's going to remain on death row"" She said the parties had made ""good progress"" so far. The arrangement being sought is known as ""confidence and supply"", under which the Tories could rely on DUP support in key votes like Budgets and no-confidence motions. Sir Michael did not reveal what the DUP had been offered in return, but said the ""outline proposal"" would be published once a deal had been agreed. The DUP,which has 10 MPs after the election, has garnered a reputation for its strong and controversial views on a number of social issues. It opposes same-sex marriage and is anti-abortion - with abortion remaining illegal in Northern Ireland, except in specific medical cases. Some Conservatives raised concerns about an alliance between the parties, with Scottish leaderRuth Davidson seeking assurances over LGBT rightsfrom Mrs May. ""Just because they're going to support us on the big economic issues, it doesn't mean we agree with all their views - we don't,"" Sir Michael said. He also said power-sharing talks between Sinn Fein and the DUP in Northern Ireland would be unaffected by the Conservatives' reliance on the unionist party at Westminster. ""We have already had a friendship with the DUP that goes back many years,"" he said. Political sources in Belfast say the DUP manifesto and a document they published in 2015 give a guide to what they will want from any deal. The2015 Northern Ireland Plan,externalwas specifically designed for a hung parliament situation. At that time the DUP hoped to be the kingmakers for either Labour or the Conservatives. At its heart is a financial package: real terms increases in health and education spending over five years, more money for infrastructure and help with transforming public services. Those could all come with hefty price tags. There are other more specific measures in the2017 manifesto,externalsuch as the abolition of air passenger duty (APD) in Northern Ireland. One senior source also put it to me, with some hyperbole, that the DUP could ""kill austerity"". By that they meant that  DUP manifesto opposes the ending of the ""triple lock"" on state pensions and the means testing of winter fuel allowance. Whether they want to see the roll-back of benefit cuts announced, but not yet implemented remains to be seen. On Brexit the DUP does not like the idea that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". Crashing out of the EU with no transitional arrangements could be hugely damaging to Northern Ireland's trade with the Republic of Ireland. The party also wants to kill off the idea of a 'special status' which would see Northern Ireland more closely aligned with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Analysis: DUP deals and dialogue Jeremy Corbyn is preparing an amendment to the Queen's Speech in which he will set out his own programme for government But Sinn Fein, which does not take its seats at Westminster, said the DUP had ""betrayed the interests of the people"" and the new arrangement would ""end in tears"". Labour's former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the planned deal was ""dodgy"" and ""unsustainable"" - and also ""irresponsible for the Northern Ireland peace process"". ""The idea that the British government could be taking sides, having been the guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent peace agreements is really troubling,"" she told Sky News. Why Queen's Speech is a big test for May The two ex-advisors under attack over election strategy John Curtice: Six key lessons from election result The new Parliamentary arithmetic means the Conservatives will need other parties' backing to get any new laws passed - and Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, predicted this would change their party's policy plans. ""There's no point in sailing ahead with items that were in our manifesto which we won't get through Parliament,"" he said. Mr Brady said there was ""no doubt"" the Queen's Speech - due on 19 June - would be ""slimmed down"", including plans for an expansion of grammar schools in England. These could be reduced to a ""modest pilot"" in certain areas, he predicted.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Putting together a Cabinet that reflects the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative party."" Theresa May said the government planned to focus on social issues and ""delivering a successful Brexit"", as she completed a Cabinet reshuffle. The PM said the new line-up brought in ""talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party"". Her comments came after Michael Gove, one of the driving forces behind Brexit, returned to the front bench as environment secretary. She said it was a ""government that's going to be governing for everyone"". Damian Green has been made first secretary of state in the reshuffle. The move effectively makes the former work and pensions secretary, a friend and ally of the PM, her second in command. When asked if she had brought back Mr Gove - seen by some as an adversary - after being left weakened by the snap election result, Mrs May said her reshuffle had ""seen people from across the party accepting the invitation to be in my cabinet"". ""Crucially I've brought in talent from across the whole of the Conservative Party. We want a country that works for everyone."" She said she had appointed ""a cabinet that will get on with the job of government"". ""That's about delivering a successful Brexit negotiations. And those negotiations start in a week's time."" Mrs May also said the government would be tackling issues such as the Brexit negotiations, and such issues as education, ""dealing for the need for more housing"" and a ""proper mental health legislation that is going to support people"". And when asked if she would continue in office, she replied: ""I said during the election campaign if re-elected, I would serve a full term."" Mr Gove told Sky News he was ""quite surprised"" to be asked to join the cabinet. ""Of course I knew that today was re-shuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa."" The previous Environment Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has been appointed as the Leader of the House in the Commons. Most other ministers have kept their roles -  but Liz Truss is moved from justice to chief Treasury secretary. Commons Leader David Lidington takes over as justice secretary and lord chancellor. Chief Treasury Secretary David Gauke has been appointed work and pensions secretary. Michael Gove was not given a Cabinet position when Mrs May assumed the role of PM last year Mrs May had been expected to carry out a widespread reshuffle of her top team after Thursday's general election but her room for manoeuvre has been limited by her failure to win an overall majority. Most of the cabinet jobs remain unchanged: Chancellor of the Exchequer - Philip Hammond Secretary of State for the Home Department - Amber Rudd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs - Boris Johnson Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union - David Davis Secretary of State for Defence - Michael Fallon Health Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Communities Secretary - Sajid Javid Culture Secretary - Karen Bradley International development - Priti Patel Transport - Chris Grayling Business - Greg Clark Damian Green, who was previously work and pensions secretary and was at university with Mrs May, has also become minister for the Cabinet Office, a position left vacant by Ben Gummer, who lost his seat in Thursday's general election. The first secretary of state is a role previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson and could see Mr Green standing in for Theresa May at prime minister's questions when she is not available. The role is periodically used by UK governments and did not exist in Mrs May's first cabinet, formed after she became prime minister in July last year. It does not come with a government department but does give its holder seniority over other cabinet ministers and is seen as being similar to the role of deputy prime minister. Andrea Leadsom takes over from David Lidington Boris Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades. ""I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well."" According to BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin, some green campaigners have reservations over Mr Gove's appointment. Tom Burke, from the think tank e3g, told the BBC: ""The environment is something young voters really care about. ""If the Tories really want to reconnect with the youth surge, this is about the worst option they could have chosen."" But a senior farming source said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had ""long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who's being put out to grass"". In the latest fallout from the general election result, which confounded pollsters and left the UK with ahung Parliament: An influential Conservative MP predicted Tory manifesto policies including on grammar schools would have to be ""slimmed down"" Mrs May was accused of putting her party interest above the Northern Ireland peace process with the planned DUP alliance Jeremy Corbyn said he could still be PMand would try to amend the Queen's Speech Former Tory Chancellor George Osbornedescribed Mrs Mayas a ""dead woman walking"" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mrs May would have to adopt a more ""collective"" approach to making decisions Pro-EU Conservativespredictedthe outcome of the general election would change the government's approach to Brexit Liz Truss was criticised for not standing up for judges involved in a Brexit court case Liam Fox retains his position as international trade secretary - he told reporters he was ""delighted"" to be continuing in the role he has held since July last year. ""It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest."" Liz Truss's change of position will be seen by some as a demotion - she was widely criticised by the judiciary following the High Court ruling regarding the government seeking Parliament's permission to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal start of the Brexit process. The judges involved were heavily criticised by some newspapers, and Mrs Truss was in turn criticised for failing to stand up for them. Justine Greening remains as education secretary - her opposition to Theresa May's policy of expanding grammar schools might be less of an issue now, if, as some expect, the government is forced to drop it from the Queen's Speech to prevent a backbench revolt.

"MPs Preet Gill, Marsha De Cordova and Justine Greening reflect the diversity of Parliament Asked to describe an average MP, many will imagine a privately-educated, straight, white man. But the make-up of the Commons is changing, with record-breaking strides being made in the 2017 general election. The vote delivered the most diverse House of Commons ever with a rise in the number of women, LGBT and ethnic minority MPs elected. There has also been an increase in MPs who went to state school as well as a boost for disabled representation. Here is how it breaks down: There are 45 MPs who openly define themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT),according to senior government equality advisor,externalJohn Peart. That is a 40% increase from the 2015 election -when there were 32,external- and includes 19 from Labour, 19 from the Tories and 7 from the SNP. Prominent LGBT MPs include Scottish Secretary David Mundell, Education Secretary Justine Greening,  and shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith. Ms Griffith publicly revealed her sexuality when she posed for a photo of 28 LGBT MPs and peersfor the Independent on Sunday,externalin 2016. Writing in Pink News,external, she said: ""Visibility matters, and it makes it easier for young people in particular to know that they can go just as far whether they are gay or straight."" Stonewall, an LGBT rights charity, says the rise in the number of LGBT candidates ""demonstrates how much progress Britain has made"". Bex Stinson, head of trans inclusion at the charity, added: ""Having LGBT people visible in public life also helps foster an inclusive society, and provides strong role models for those who don't yet feel able to be themselves and for young LGBT people."" However, she said more needs to be done to increase transgender representation after none of the nine transgender candidates who stood were elected. The general election of 1987 saw the first ever black MPs voted into the House of Commons. Fast forward 30 years and the 2017 result has seen 52 ethnic minority MPs elected,says think tank British Future,external. Of those, 32 are Labour, 19 Conservatives and one Lib Dem. It is an increase from 41 in 2015 and the highest number ever. They include Preet Gill,the first female Sikh MP, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, who became the first ever black female MP in 1987, and Manchester's first Muslim MP Afzal Khan. Operation Black Vote said many more ethnic minority candidates won in non-urban areas which showed the UK was ""comfortable with its multicultural society."" Director Simon Woolley said: ""More talented BME faces will help transform Parliament and inspire many more to believe that we all have a voice and a place in our society."" Steve Ballinger, director of communications for British Future, said: ""It's got to be good for politics that gradually Parliament is getting closer to looking a bit more like the electorate that it serves."" He said the majority of the MPs from ethnic minorities would be sitting on Labour benches, which was partly due to the Tories not choosing enough ethnic minority candidates. ""I know there are calls within the Conservative Party to do better in that respect."" There is more gender equality than ever before in Parliament after a record 208 women were elected in Thursday's vote. Nearly 100 years after the law was changed to allow women to become MPs,they now make up 32%of the Commons. The number of women MPs has increased by almost 9% since the 2015 election, when 191 were voted into Parliament. Labour has the most women with 119, while the Tories have 67, the SNP 12 and the Lib Dems 4. But with females making up more than 50% of the UK population, the Commons still has a way to go to truly represent the make-up of the country. The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for women's rights, says progress has stalled. Chief executive Sam Smethers said: ""The time has come for a legally enforceable target to achieve the radical and sustainable change we need."" While there are no definitive figures on the number of disabled MPs, it appears there has been an increase in the 2017 Parliament. Labour has two new MPs in the Commons who have disabilities. Marsha de Cordova, who represents Battersea, is registered blind andused her victory speech,externalto champion disabled rights. Jared O'Mara, who has cerebral palsy hemiparesis, took Sheffield Hallam from former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. He haspreviously written,externalabout the importance of political parties having a strong representation of disabled candidates. Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd,who is hard of hearing,external, returns to Parliament after losing his seat in the 2015 election. Conservative MP Robert Halfon,who was born with mild cerebral palsyand has since developed osteoarthritis, was re-elected. He is joined in Parliament by fellow Tory Paul Maynard,who also has cerebral palsy. Scope's chief executive Mark Atkinson said it was encouraging to see an increase in the number of disabled politicians elected. ""Whilst there is more work to do, this is a positive step forward in combating the under-representation of disabled people in public life."" David Cameron, Boris Johnson and George Osborne are just a few of the notable past and present MPs to have received a private education. But 2017 has seen a shift in educational background, with more than half of those elected having been to state schools. Analysis by the Sutton Trust,externalfound that 51% of MPs in the new Commons went to comprehensive schools, while 29% went to private school and 18% selective states. In 2015, the figures were 49%, 32% and 19% respectively. The analysis found 45% of all Conservative MPs elected in 2017 were privately educated, compared to 14% of Labour MPs and 6% of SNP MPs. The figures do not include MPs who were home schooled or educated abroad. Sutton Trust chairman and founder Sir Peter Lampl said the ""landscape of British politics has changed considerably"". But he said the number of MPs attending private school was still far higher than the general population which stands at 7%. He added: ""If parliament is to truly represent the nation as a whole, able people from all backgrounds should have the opportunity to become MPs.""

What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda.

He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"".

Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"Photographer Shirley Baker captured images of slum life at a time when substandard housing was being bulldozed Photographs taken at the time of Manchester and Salford's post-war inner-city clearance programmes have gone on show. Photographer Shirley Baker died in 2014 aged 82, leaving behind a body of work that had received little attention over her 55-year career. An exhibition of her images is now on show at Manchester Art Gallery. It focuses on what Baker saw as the needless destruction of working-class communities between the 1960s and 80s. The museum held an open day in the hope of tracking down people who featured in the photographs, some of whom have come forward. Children are pictured playing in the Hulme area of Manchester Baker's images often show families going about their daily lives, with gangs of children playing in the street. Broken urban landscapes of rubble, junk and abandoned shops also feature widely, at a time when dilapidated old houses were being bulldozed. Many hundreds of homes fell into disrepair in the post-war era - sometimes due to bomb damage - forcing some families to leave for new areas. Baker, who was born in Salford in 1932, once said: ""Whole streets were disappearing and I hoped to capture some trace of the everyday life of people who lived there. ""I wanted to photograph the mundane, even trivial aspects of life not being recorded by anyone else, rather than the organised and official activities."" This boy's attention appears to have been drawn to an abandoned blackboard Mary Sullivan, Sally Sheldon, Kate Withington and Bridget Cunniffe grew up in Honduras Street in Chorlton-on-Medlock, which features in some of the photographs. Ms Cunniffe said: ""We didn't have much room to play in our house, because it was just a two-up, two-down, and we had just a little back yard where all the washing used to be done. ""So we were always outside. Those demolished playgrounds were our playgrounds."" Shirley Baker's work often focused on the rubble and dereliction of clearance programmes Brothers Stephen, Derek and Peter Williamson, who lived as part of a 10-strong family in Gertrude Street in Ordsall, Salford, are pictured in the exhibition. ""It was known as tea leaf alley, because all the old ladies used to empty their teapots into the road,"" Derek said. ""I smile when I see [the photographs] now. I think they were good times. I appreciated everything we had."" Women and Children: and Loitering Men will be on show at Manchester Art Gallery until the end of July Many of the colour images were taken in the 1960s Children often feature in the photographs Baker's photographs were developed using different colour tones The photographer often preferred to work in black and white A gang of children appear happy as they play in a rubble-strewn street A father and his children are shown wearing clothes that now appear rather old-fashioned Manchester Art Gallery Police chief donates Â£10,000 to rape and sexual assault support centre Car park in Warrington closed due to number of dangerous driving incidents Bury Market makes top 10 shortlist to be named 'Britain's favourite market' again Living near an airport could quadruple heart attack risk, study suggests Tributes as Second World War 'Desert Rat' who spent whole life in Manchester dies aged 103 Family rescued by boat in flood fear it will happen again At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Celebrities such as Paris Hilton have been the subject of prank shows From shipwrecks to terror attacks to an air disaster involving Paris Hilton, it seems that almost nothing is off-limits for the prank shows that have become a staple of North African TV during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for ""atheism and espionage"". During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation ""God is Greatest"" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith. The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society. Algerian novelist Rachid Boudjedra (L) was pranked in Ennahar TV's show Rana Hakamnak (We Got You) TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening. Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far. Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios. Watching TV has become an important part of Ramadan for some In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark. In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead. In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants. The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests. Pranks sometimes replicate real life terror attacks This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas. Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to ""torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them"". And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank. Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case. Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor. Contestants in The Earthquake are convinced that a major tremor is under way In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake. The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared. Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was ""unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame"". Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden. The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month. Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue. But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals. Some describe The Shock as one of the best programmes aired during Ramadan The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat. It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations. As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: ""Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective.""

"Theresa May announces judge-led public inquiry into Grenfell Tower tragedy MPs now quizzing minister about response to the tragedy Queen's Speech to take place on Wednesday 21 June Tim Farron is to step down as Lib Dem leader MPs being sworn in to the House of Commons Deal between Tories and DUP delayed because of the tragedy Emma Griffiths Theresa May reshuffles her cabinet after the departures of Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon. What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"". Devolved government in Northern Ireland broke down in January. Former Labour deputy leader tweets ...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda. Here's a round-up of the latest developments on this and other political stories today: The Lib Dems have warned the Conservatives they ""cannot go from weak and wobbly to business as usual"" after the government announced formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday. Lib Dem MP Alistair
Carmichael said: If the government cannot even secure a deal with the DUP, how on earth can they get a deal with the EU? Theresa May must immediately create a cross-party joint cabinet committee to negotiate Brexit.

Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams says his party will oppose any pact between the UK government and the DUP ""that undermines the Good Friday Agreement"". He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said. Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"This video can not be played Insp Jim Cole rushed to the scene to give first aid One of the first police officers on the scene of the London Bridge attack has told how he helped 200 people hide from danger in a pub cellar. Inspector Jim Cole said he had been confronted by people wounded and in a ""state of panic"" in Borough Market. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people on 3 June, running over pedestrians on the bridge and stabbing people nearby. Insp Cole said the memories would ""stick with me for a long time"". Dozens of people were also injured in the attack, which began shortly before 22:00 BST. Police have revealed that the attackers hadtried to hire a 7.5 tonne lorry to carry out their assault, which included mowing down pedestrians. But the three men failed to provide payment details and the vehicle was not picked up, prompting them to use a smaller van from a DIY store instead. Attackers' fake bomb belts 'created fear' Victims of the London Bridge attack London attack: What we know so far The heroes who rushed to help Insp Cole, a 41-year-old father of three, described the scene at Peckham police station as the alarm was raised as ""like something out of a movie with police officers running everywhere"". He had been due to finish his shift, but instead found himself racing with others to Borough Market. Once there they were confronted by armed police and wounded people on the pavement, including a man who had been stabbed in the stomach. The unarmed officer helped get people into a pub cellar to hide as shots rang out in the market. The eight victims of the London Bridge terror attack. Top row left to right: Alexandre Pigeard, Christine Archibald, Ignacio Echevarria, Sara Zelenak. Bottom row left to right: James McMullan, Kirsty Boden, Xavier Thomas and Sebastien Belanger Insp Cole said: ""We had the situation of people coming running out of the market, they were in a state of panic - lots of screaming. ""So I literally just grabbed hold of as many as we could and directed them into the basement of the bar. ""I felt that was as reasonably safe a place as we had at the moment, rather than roaming the streets."" After getting the news that the attackers had been shot, Insp Cole went to tell those sheltering in the pub. ""I spoke with the 200 frightened people in the basement and told them that there were armed officers outside, we were safe and we would evacuate them as soon as we could. ""I got a big round of applause. That was a really nice, unexpected moment. It was a nice touch."" Insp Cole said he could hear his colleagues over the radio ""in quite a state of distress"" as they desperately called for ambulances. He added: ""I've dealt with a lot of death and I've been to some pretty horrific scenes in my career, but nothing has ever been on that scale. ""It was the most challenging, most intense situation I've dealt with. It's going to stick with me for a long time."" The business editor of the Sunday Express, who was stabbed during the attack,has written about his ordeal,externalfor his newspaper, whilst recovering in hospital. Geoff Ho was stabbed in the neck while trying to protect his friend and other members of the public from the three armed men at the Black & Blue restaurant in Southwark. He described how the attackers broke through the locked door of the restaurant, yelling at people to lie down on the ground. Geoff Ho was stabbed in the throat by the attackers ""I knew that if anyone did that, they'd be dead,"" wrote Mr Ho. ""I had to delay them, stall them any way I could. ""With my hands up, trying to look non-threatening, I stared back at them and said one word - No."" He was then struck in the throat. With the help of his friend, he managed to create makeshift bandages to stem the bleeding. Mr Ho heard the attackers shot by police and said it felt like ""running through a war zone"" as he went to get help from the emergency services. ""Me and my friends wouldn't be alive without the brave men and women of the Metropolitan Police, London Ambulance Service, the British Transport Police, who dived in with no thought for their own safety,"" he wrote.

"Theresa May's Conservatives are seeking a deal with Arlene Foster's DUP Downing Street and the Democratic Unionist Party say they are still in discussions over a possible deal to secure support for a minority Conservative government. On Saturday, Downing Street announced a deal had been agreed in principle - but both sides then issued statements saying talks were ongoing. The Tories need the support of the DUP's 10 MPs for a Commons majority. No 10 described it as a ""confidence and supply"" deal rather than a coalition. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure after Thursday's general election left her without a majority. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told theSunday Mirrorhe could still be prime minister. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, dismissed reports of a Tory party leadership bid as ""tripe"". Live: Corbyn among Sunday political interviewees Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? The agreement being discussed between the DUP and the Tories, who fell eight seats short of a majority in Thursday's election, is not a full coalition, but an agreement which sees the smaller party support the larger one in key votes such as on the Budget. Downing Street and the DUP issued separate statements overnight, emphasising that the deal between them had not yet been finalised. The tone of both was in contrast to Saturday evening's message from No 10, which said a deal had been agreed in principle. In a DUP statement released at midnight, the party said: ""The DUP held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge. ""The talks so far have been positive."" The DUP also retweeted a Sky News journalist's tweet claiming Downing Street's first statement had been issued in error. Within an hour, Downing Street said the details would be put forward by both parties ""as and when"" they were finalised. It added: ""We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond."" No explanation has been given for the change by Downing Street. In response to the earlier Downing Street statement, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on Mrs May to make public immediately the details of the deal ""stitched up behind closed doors"". Sinn FÃ©in's leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill said the DUP had ""betrayed the interests of the people"" and the new arrangement would ""end in tears"". Mr Corbyn said the government did not have any credibility to go forward and the Labour Party would do what it could to stop it, including by voting down the Queen's Speech. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? What does result mean for Brexit? Sinn FÃ©in has said the deal will ""end in tears"" The DUP are pro-union in UK terms, pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party's 2017 manifesto outlined calls for increases in the personal tax allowance, continued rises in the national living wage, renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent and revisiting terrorism laws - all similar to Conservative policy. But they differ in areas including abolishing air passenger duty, cutting VAT for tourism businesses and maintaining a triple lock on pensions. Why Queen's Speech is a big test for May What you want to know about the election result Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson met DUP chiefs in Belfast on Saturday. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said the DUP and Conservatives had been ""looking at the full range of possibilities"" during Mr Williamson's visit. The parties had discussed everything from just an informal undertaking to a full coalition agreement. He added: ""I am told that what the DUP are looking at is securing benefits. So keep the pension triple lock and preserve universal benefits such as the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. ""That would allow the DUP to say 'we are not just acting in the interests of Northern Ireland, we are true unionists, we are acting in the interest of the whole of the United Kingdom'."" Meanwhile,the Mail on Sunday,externalreported a ""close ally"" of Mr Johnson as saying it was ""go-go-go"" to get him to take over the party from Mrs May. But Mr Johnsontweeted,external: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa May. Let's get on with the job."" This deal would see the DUP promise to back the government in votes of no confidence and supply - or Budget - issues. In return, the government would support or fund some of the DUP's policies. These deals tend to be loose and a long way short of a formal coalition. Minority governments like this are not uncommon. John Major survived without a majority in the dying days of his Tory administration in the mid-1990s. Labour's Harold Wilson and James Callaghan governed with minorities for much of the 1970s. But these governments can be quite constrained in what they can do, passing as little legislation as possible to avoid defeat. They can also be unstable and short lived, if the deal between the parties breaks down and fresh elections have to be called.

"The three men were wearing these belts during the attack at London Bridge Police have released images of the fake explosives belts worn by the men who carried out the London Bridge attack. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba wore the belts as they stabbed people in Borough Market. The officer leading the investigation said use of the belts was a ""tactic"" he had not seen before in the UK and one that created ""maximum fear"". The belts were still on the attackers, who murdered eight people, when they were shot dead by police. Each belt had three disposable water bottles covered in adhesive tape attached to them. Commander Dean Haydon, of the Metropolitan Police, said anyone who had seen the belts on the night would have thought they were genuine. ""I have not seen this tactic in the UK before, where terrorists create maximum fear by strapping fake explosives to themselves,"" he said. ""It makes the bravery of those police officers and members of the public who tackled the terrorists even more remarkable."" Victims of the London Bridge attack London attackers 'planned to use lorry' London attack: What we know so far The heroes who rushed to help Commander Haydon said it was hard to speculate what the motive had been for wearing the belts, but said the three attackers may have had plans for a siege or might have seen them as possible protection from being shot themselves. The photos were released a day after police revealed that the attackers had tried to hire a 7.5 tonne lorry to run people over on London Bridge during the 3 June attack. The men failed to provide payment details and the vehicle was not picked up, prompting them to use a smaller van from a DIY store instead. All eight victims of the attackhave been named. They were 30-year-old Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, Australian Kirsty Boden, 28, Australian Sara Zelenak, 21, James McMullan, 32, from Hackney, London, Frenchmen Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Xavier Thomas, 45, and chef Sebastien Belanger, 36, and Spaniard Ignacio Echeverria, 39. Eight people were killed in the attack last Saturday. Since the attack, 20 people have been arrested, with 13 buildings searched. Seven people remain in custody. The police said they had questioned 262 witnesses from 19 countries - of which 78 are classed as ""significant"" - but they believe there are more people with information and have urged them to come forward.

The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people.

Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""

"As the Conservative Party loses its overall majority in the general election, the outcome has prompted many questions to be asked about the vote itself and what happens next. From a possible power block created between the Conservatives and the DUP, to fears of another election or even a bad Brexit deal, voters want to know what the future holds and what sort of government the UK will get in the end. Here, we tackle some of the questions being raised by BBC audiences. Theresa May has already started her cabinet reshuffleand the main ministers to stay in place include Brexit Secretary David Davis, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon. To win theDUP's support the prime minister will undoubtedly have to make some concessions but it remains to be seen if this will include cabinet appointments for any of its 10 members. It is mostly likely thatdeals will be around securing additional funding for Northern Irelandand extended powers for its Executive if it can be reconstituted. DUP leader Arlene Foster will negotiate a deal over her party's support for the Conservatives with Theresa May Theresa May hasvowed to form a successful governmentalthough there issome speculation that her tenure at No 10 might be limited. If she were to resign then it would be for theConservative Party to chose a new leader who would then become prime minister. This is what happened when David Cameron resigned after the EU Referendum last year. The Conservatives won the largest number of seats at the 2017 general election, but if its minority government proves ineffective and another poll is called Jeremy Corbyn could lead Labour to victory. There are 650 MPs elected to the House of Commons and for a party to turn its policies into law, it technically needs the support of 50% of them plus one seat, which is 326. If a party has 326 MPs or more it will be able to forma majority government,externaland secure sufficient backing to ensure it can pass legislation. If it has fewer than 326 MPs it will always need to rely on the support of others - either from other parties or Independents - in order to implement its decisions. So the party which forms the government must be able to guarantee that it can push its agenda forward and be effective in its leadership of the country. The political system in Switzerlandis very different to that in the UK and is unusual because it has a collective head of state - the seven-member Federal Council - which is also the country's cabinet. The council was set up by the constitution of 1848 which is still in force today. Members are elected for four-year terms by a joint session of both houses of parliament, although in practice changes in membership are rare, making the Federal Council one of the world's most stable governments. Each year a different member of the council fills the largely ceremonial post of federal president on a rotating basis. However, the office does not confer the status of head of state, which is held jointly by all the councillors. In the UK the House of Commons is the democratically-elected chamber and a government needs to have at least 326 MPs (which is just more than half the total number) in order to pass its legislation. To create a government like the one in Switzerland the UK would have to completely restructure its political systems. Even it it was acceptable to voters it would take years to put in place. Although people refer to the ""constitution"", in the UK it does not exist in the traditional form with a single document outlining a constitutional charter. However, most other modern states in the world do have one of these. Insteadthe UK's unwritten constitution has evolved over the centuries,externalfrom an amalgamation of Acts of Parliament, court rulings that lay down precedents for future decisions and accepted conventions. Two of its historic building blocks are the 1689 Bill of Rights which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown and Magna Carta of 1215. The prospect of creating a written constitution continues to be considered and in 2015 theParliamentary Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, which had consulted on the matter, concluded,external: ""While there was broad general support for a written constitution, we recognise that there are strong views expressed against codifying our existing constitution, or at least codifying it in its current form."" The committee publisheda draft summary of the UK's constitution along with together with some options for reform,externaland encouraged further work on the project. A facsimile copy of the 1215 document, Magna Carta, in the library at Salisbury Cathedral Numbers-wise, both parties could join to form a working majority that could vote legislation through. However, the biggest problem could be agreeing on policies in the first place. You can see from theirmanifesto pledgesthat there may be more issues that divide them rather than unite them. While both main parties have ruled out a second referendum on Brexit, Labour have not been explicit about many of their aims on the issue. The parties differ enormously on the future funding of the NHS, taxation and social care - to list only a few important areas where reaching a consensus could prove more of an issue than simply having a big enough cohort of MPs. It is possible to have another election but as Theresa May has learned, forcing the public into another round of voting is not always a good idea. Voter fatigue could set in as the electorate may feel it cannot face going through a fourth UK-wide vote (including the EU referendum) in three years. Another vote could backfire with a drop in turnout. However, the prime minister has said she will not resign and will find a way to form a minority government, indicating the Conservatives willseek the support of the Democratic Unionist Party(DUP). Under theFixed-term Parliaments Act 2011,,externalgeneral elections take place on the first Thursday in May every five years but there are some ways in which another election could be called. First, it could happen if two-thirds of MPs back a motion calling for an early election. It's two-thirds of all the seats in the House of Commons - not only those who vote - and it includes vacant seats. With 650 seats, that means 434 MPs must back an early election. This would be the quickest way. Alternatively, an election could come about if a motion of no confidence in the government is passed in the House of Commons and no motion expressing confidence in the government is subsequently passed within 14 days - the wording of these motions has to be precisely as set out by the Act. The single reason Mrs May said she called the election was to strengthen her position innegotiating a good Brexit deal.It is inevitable now that with a reduced majority she will have to compromise her aims in order to get support from the other parties. In particular the DUP - with whom Mrs May has said she will work - could be very influential here. Time is of the essence though, as negotiations with the remaining European Union (EU) countries is due to start on 19 June. The new government and its partners will have to work hard to agree a strategy, although the EU's budget commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, tweeted that the UK is nowa weaker negotiating partner,externalthan prior to the election and questioned whether the Brexit negotiations could start on schedule. The Queen's Speechis the address that the Queen reads out on the occasion of theState Opening of Parliament,externalin front of MPs and peers. It is written by the government and outlines the programme of legislation that it wants to pass in the forthcoming Parliamentary year. It is an event filled with pageantry dating back many centuries and generally happens at the start of each Parliamentary session - although in 2011 the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one. After the pomp and ceremony of the occasion, the Queen returns to Buckingham Palace and MPs move to the House of Commons to debate the speech. This can last a number of days. While the vote at the end is generally symbolic, it is possible that someone could take the opportunity to voice their opposition to its contents by voting against it. With a minority government therefore it is feasible that Mrs May's proposals could be rejected before they pass the first hurdle. Members of the House of Lords also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.

"Theresa May's Conservatives are seeking a deal with Arlene Foster's DUP Downing Street and the Democratic Unionist Party say they are still in discussions over a possible deal to secure support for a minority Conservative government. On Saturday, Downing Street announced a deal had been agreed in principle - but both sides then issued statements saying talks were ongoing. The Tories need the support of the DUP's 10 MPs for a Commons majority. No 10 described it as a ""confidence and supply"" deal rather than a coalition. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure after Thursday's general election left her without a majority. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told theSunday Mirrorhe could still be prime minister. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, dismissed reports of a Tory party leadership bid as ""tripe"". Live: Corbyn among Sunday political interviewees Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? The agreement being discussed between the DUP and the Tories, who fell eight seats short of a majority in Thursday's election, is not a full coalition, but an agreement which sees the smaller party support the larger one in key votes such as on the Budget. Downing Street and the DUP issued separate statements overnight, emphasising that the deal between them had not yet been finalised. The tone of both was in contrast to Saturday evening's message from No 10, which said a deal had been agreed in principle. In a DUP statement released at midnight, the party said: ""The DUP held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge. ""The talks so far have been positive."" The DUP also retweeted a Sky News journalist's tweet claiming Downing Street's first statement had been issued in error. Within an hour, Downing Street said the details would be put forward by both parties ""as and when"" they were finalised. It added: ""We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond."" No explanation has been given for the change by Downing Street. In response to the earlier Downing Street statement, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on Mrs May to make public immediately the details of the deal ""stitched up behind closed doors"". Sinn FÃ©in's leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill said the DUP had ""betrayed the interests of the people"" and the new arrangement would ""end in tears"". Mr Corbyn said the government did not have any credibility to go forward and the Labour Party would do what it could to stop it, including by voting down the Queen's Speech. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? What does result mean for Brexit? Sinn FÃ©in has said the deal will ""end in tears"" The DUP are pro-union in UK terms, pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party's 2017 manifesto outlined calls for increases in the personal tax allowance, continued rises in the national living wage, renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent and revisiting terrorism laws - all similar to Conservative policy. But they differ in areas including abolishing air passenger duty, cutting VAT for tourism businesses and maintaining a triple lock on pensions. Why Queen's Speech is a big test for May What you want to know about the election result Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson met DUP chiefs in Belfast on Saturday. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said the DUP and Conservatives had been ""looking at the full range of possibilities"" during Mr Williamson's visit. The parties had discussed everything from just an informal undertaking to a full coalition agreement. He added: ""I am told that what the DUP are looking at is securing benefits. So keep the pension triple lock and preserve universal benefits such as the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. ""That would allow the DUP to say 'we are not just acting in the interests of Northern Ireland, we are true unionists, we are acting in the interest of the whole of the United Kingdom'."" Meanwhile,the Mail on Sunday,externalreported a ""close ally"" of Mr Johnson as saying it was ""go-go-go"" to get him to take over the party from Mrs May. But Mr Johnsontweeted,external: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa May. Let's get on with the job."" This deal would see the DUP promise to back the government in votes of no confidence and supply - or Budget - issues. In return, the government would support or fund some of the DUP's policies. These deals tend to be loose and a long way short of a formal coalition. Minority governments like this are not uncommon. John Major survived without a majority in the dying days of his Tory administration in the mid-1990s. Labour's Harold Wilson and James Callaghan governed with minorities for much of the 1970s. But these governments can be quite constrained in what they can do, passing as little legislation as possible to avoid defeat. They can also be unstable and short lived, if the deal between the parties breaks down and fresh elections have to be called.

"Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (pictured in 2011) was sentenced to death by a court in Tripoli in 2015 Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, second son of the late deposed Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, has been freed from jail under an amnesty law. His father's preferred successor, he had been held by a militia in the town of Zintan for the past six years. The Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion said he had been released on Friday but he has not been seen in public. It is feared the move could fuel further instability in Libya. His lawyer, Khaled al-Zaidi, confirmed he had been released. He declined to say which city Saif al-Islam had travelled to for security reasons.

However, he has been sentenced to death in absentia by a court in Tripoli, in the west of the country, where control is in the hands of the rival, UN-backed Government of National Accord. Saif Gaddafi still commands some support in Libya Saif al-Islam is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity during his father's unsuccessful attempts to put down the rebellion against his rule. The Zintan Military Council - which had previously been involved in his detention - and Zintan's municipal council have condemned his release by the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion. The councils said in a statement that freeing Saif al-Islam was ""a form of collusion, a betrayal of the blood of the martyrs and stab in the back of the military body to which they [the brigade] claim to belong"". The release of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi will add another unpredictable element to Libya's unstable mix. He was detained in the desert in November 2011 trying to flee to Niger, and later appeared missing several fingers. The former playboy often appeared in the West as the public face of the Gaddafi regime and was his father's heir-apparent. While reviled by many - at home and abroad - he retains some support in Libya and could try to re-enter the political fray here. The 44-year-old Saif al-Islam - who was controversially granted a PhD by the London School of Economics in 2008 - was captured in November 2011 after three months on the run following the end of Muammar Gaddafi's decades-long rule. Saif al-Islam, pictured before his capture, was awarded a PhD from the London School of Economics He was previously known for playing a key role in building relations with the West after 2000, and had been considered the reformist face of his father's regime. But after the 2011 uprising, he found himself accused of incitement to violence and murdering protesters. Four years later, he wassentenced to death by firing squadfollowing a trial involving 30 of Gaddafi's close associates. Reaction on social media to Saif al-Islam's release has been mixed. One Twitter user said: ""When the world is upside down, the killer becomes innocent and the victim becomes a terrorist. The blood of the martyrs disappears and Saif al-Islam becomes a free man!"" By contrast, another Twitter user posted a video showing celebrations of Saif al-Islam's release in the north-western town of Asabea, in which people appeared be carrying the green flags associated with his father's rule. He was also described as a ""lifeline to the Libyan people"".

"Theresa May's Conservatives are seeking a deal with Arlene Foster's DUP Downing Street and the Democratic Unionist Party say they are still in discussions over a possible deal to secure support for a minority Conservative government. On Saturday, Downing Street announced a deal had been agreed in principle - but both sides then issued statements saying talks were ongoing. The Tories need the support of the DUP's 10 MPs for a Commons majority. No 10 described it as a ""confidence and supply"" deal rather than a coalition. Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure after Thursday's general election left her without a majority. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told theSunday Mirrorhe could still be prime minister. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, dismissed reports of a Tory party leadership bid as ""tripe"". Live: Corbyn among Sunday political interviewees Who are the DUP? Can a Conservative-DUP pact work? Q&A: What is a hung parliament? The agreement being discussed between the DUP and the Tories, who fell eight seats short of a majority in Thursday's election, is not a full coalition, but an agreement which sees the smaller party support the larger one in key votes such as on the Budget. Downing Street and the DUP issued separate statements overnight, emphasising that the deal between them had not yet been finalised. The tone of both was in contrast to Saturday evening's message from No 10, which said a deal had been agreed in principle. In a DUP statement released at midnight, the party said: ""The DUP held discussions with representatives of the Conservative Party in line with Arlene Foster's commitment to explore how we might bring stability to the nation at this time of great challenge. ""The talks so far have been positive."" The DUP also retweeted a Sky News journalist's tweet claiming Downing Street's first statement had been issued in error. Within an hour, Downing Street said the details would be put forward by both parties ""as and when"" they were finalised. It added: ""We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond."" No explanation has been given for the change by Downing Street. In response to the earlier Downing Street statement, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called on Mrs May to make public immediately the details of the deal ""stitched up behind closed doors"". Sinn FÃ©in's leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill said the DUP had ""betrayed the interests of the people"" and the new arrangement would ""end in tears"". Mr Corbyn said the government did not have any credibility to go forward and the Labour Party would do what it could to stop it, including by voting down the Queen's Speech. Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? What does result mean for Brexit? Sinn FÃ©in has said the deal will ""end in tears"" The DUP are pro-union in UK terms, pro-Brexit and socially conservative. The party's 2017 manifesto outlined calls for increases in the personal tax allowance, continued rises in the national living wage, renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent and revisiting terrorism laws - all similar to Conservative policy. But they differ in areas including abolishing air passenger duty, cutting VAT for tourism businesses and maintaining a triple lock on pensions. Why Queen's Speech is a big test for May What you want to know about the election result Tory chief whip Gavin Williamson met DUP chiefs in Belfast on Saturday. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said the DUP and Conservatives had been ""looking at the full range of possibilities"" during Mr Williamson's visit. The parties had discussed everything from just an informal undertaking to a full coalition agreement. He added: ""I am told that what the DUP are looking at is securing benefits. So keep the pension triple lock and preserve universal benefits such as the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. ""That would allow the DUP to say 'we are not just acting in the interests of Northern Ireland, we are true unionists, we are acting in the interest of the whole of the United Kingdom'."" Meanwhile,the Mail on Sunday,externalreported a ""close ally"" of Mr Johnson as saying it was ""go-go-go"" to get him to take over the party from Mrs May. But Mr Johnsontweeted,external: ""Mail on Sunday tripe - I am backing Theresa May. Let's get on with the job."" This deal would see the DUP promise to back the government in votes of no confidence and supply - or Budget - issues. In return, the government would support or fund some of the DUP's policies. These deals tend to be loose and a long way short of a formal coalition. Minority governments like this are not uncommon. John Major survived without a majority in the dying days of his Tory administration in the mid-1990s. Labour's Harold Wilson and James Callaghan governed with minorities for much of the 1970s. But these governments can be quite constrained in what they can do, passing as little legislation as possible to avoid defeat. They can also be unstable and short lived, if the deal between the parties breaks down and fresh elections have to be called.

"When Syria's civil war came to the city of Aleppo in 2012, Zahed Tajeddin was cut off from his 450-year-old home. He worried about it, but it survived - and he later discovered how it served as a life-saving medical centre for people living under constant bombardment. Zahed Tajeddin had always wanted to live in Aleppo's historic old town, in one of the city's ancient houses, with a front door opening into a corridor that leads to courtyard with a fountain and jasmine climbing up the walls. His father had been brought up in one, but Tajeddin himself had spent his childhood in a modern flat in a modern district of the city. As a teenager, he would explore the old houses just before they were demolished, scampering through courtyards and over crumbling rooftops. He finally managed to buy one for himself, after making a career as a sculptor and archaeologist, in 2004. Zahed's grandmother with his father Ghassan in the courtyard of their home He chose the neighbourhood of Judaydah, which means ""little new quarter"" in the local dialect. Although it started to take shape in the 15th Century, this was in fact ""new"" in a city with 6,000 years of continuous human habitation. ""For me that area was so special,"" Tajeddin says. Zahed dreamed of owning a historic house - and then he found one in Judaydah As well as the medieval mansions there were stone alleyways, squares, churches, mosques, coffeehouses - and the ever-present scent of flowers. ""You always have the smell of jasmine. It's typical of Aleppo streets,"" Zahed says. ""It's a magical atmosphere."" Arches decorated the streets of Judaydah (credit Yasser Tabbaa - Courtesy of the Aga Khan Documentation Center at MIT) Tajeddin was living in London with his wife and children when the Syrian conflict began. He watched from afar as war engulfed Aleppo in 2012 and Judaydah became a battleground between government soldiers and opposition fighters. Zahed Tajeddin and Abu Ahmed's stories form part of the Museum of Lost Objects on BBC World Service.Subscribe to the podcastorlisten on iplayer ""It was the most difficult thing being away and hearing the news. You try to chase what's going on,"" he says. He searched obsessively online for any information. ""One YouTube video shows a battle on my doorstep. So people fighting and screaming in my little street,"" he says. Even more distressing was when his fragile 84-year-old father, trying to reach the house from his own home in government-held territory, was caught in sniper fire. ""For two hours he had to stay flat on the floor at the corner of the street while bullets were flying over his head,"" Tajeddin says. ""After that he never went again."" The courtyard of a typical house in Judaydah during the war in 2013 Tajeddin's first return visit to the city, in autumn 2015, also nearly ended in disaster. ""You enter through ruins,"" he says. ""It's very emotional to see it that way."" He climbed one of Aleppo's highest towers to look down on the old town, now a grey, almost lunar landscape, with expanses of blasted masonry, buildings reduced to husks, and canyons of rubble. The sight was enough to make him cry. He then tried to walk into Judaydah, and got within 150m of his home, only to find sandbags blocking the road. Daringly he crossed the line, but had proceeded only a few steps before government soldiers intercepted him and turned him back. ""The officer, luckily, was a kind man,"" Tajeddin says. ""He said to me, 'You've been very lucky. We have strict orders just to shoot. This is a war zone.'"" A rebel cannon in the streets of Judaydah When fighting erupted in Aleppo, a pharmacist from a village to the south of the city felt that he could not just stand by and watch. Abu Ahmed left behind his wife and young family and moved close to the action. Then he went door-to-door giving first aid, applying dressings, bandages, and dispensing medicine. A few months later, he started looking for a house with cellars, where he could store medicines and treat patients in safety, and he found one in Judaydah - Tajeddin's house, though he didn't know it. ""I had looked for the owner, but because all the neighbours had now left no-one knew where the owner was,"" Abu Ahmed says. ""There was a lot of shelling in the area, but somehow I felt secure there. It also didn't have any medical centres, so I thought I could be useful."" He kept the upper floor locked but began work to convert the area downstairs. He turned the living room into a reception area, using the sofas and bringing in extra chairs. One of the rooms opening on to the courtyard became a treatment room with X-ray machines, another a recovery room.  He managed to squeeze nine hospital beds into the cellars. Sometimes patients waited in the courtyard Thanks to financial support from aid agencies, all medicine was distributed free. Abu Ahmed found himself working long hours every day of the week, playing the roles of doctor, ambulance driver and pharmacist all at once. ""Every day was stressful,"" he says. ""People had injuries from shrapnel, some had internal bleeding, even some amputations. Sometimes people were brought to me already dead with sniper wounds in their head. ""Sometimes I used to have panic attacks. When you see that things are getting worse and there's no solution ahead, you start wishing for death but fail to find it. I saw many cases where I couldn't do anything to help. What can I do except stem the blood, soothe the pain?"" Judaydah suffered frequent bombardment. ""One time it was late afternoon, there were maybe 10 patients with me,"" he says. ""I heard jets hovering above. I took my patients and we ran downstairs to the cellars. We barely got there before the strike hit. ""The whole house shook, there was dust, rubble, broken windows. We couldn't see anything. After about 15-20 minutes we started checking up on each other. Calling out our names to see if we were all still there. Thankfully everyone was okay."" The rocket had missed them by metres, but the house next door was completely flattened. The ruins of Tajeddin's neighbour's house On one occasion a children's party was held in the courtyard, with silver tinsel streaming from the medieval arches, and balloons filling the fountain. If only for an afternoon, Abu Ahmed and his salvaged house offered the young people living nearby - many of them orphans - a break from their daily ordeal. During the war, Abu Ahmed hosted a party for local children - many of them orphans The old house also helped Abu Ahmed to experience moments of calm in his own hectic life. ""The most peaceful moment was at about five or six in the morning, just after morning prayers,"" he says. ""I would sit in the courtyard next to the trees, near the fountain, and have a coffee. I'd smell the jasmine, the honeysuckle, and the morning dew. ""Sitting that way made me forget everything I'd seen the day before. I would forget my nightmares. I savoured those moments."" Abu Ahmed's family remained in Aleppo, but in a quieter area. It was difficult for them to meet and eventually the pharmacist married his second wife. One consequence was that in late 2016, when Aleppo was under intense siege, his new wife gave birth to a baby girl. It was a moment of intense happiness, Abu Ahmed says, but as both mother and baby were malnourished they were kept in hospital - and on their third day there it was bombed. Fortunately they were unhurt, but it was too close for comfort and Abu Ahmed took them back to his medical centre in Judaydah. Abu Ahmed had a stamp made for the medical point, the ""nokhte tibiyya"" in Arabic ""I cared for her myself,"" he says. ""When people ask me how I managed to have a baby girl under siege and keep her alive, well, I really don't know. God was looking out for us."" They remained there, in rebel-held Aleppo, right until the end of the siege in December 2016. ""It was winter, and cold and there was no food either,"" Abu Ahmed remembers. ""It got to a point where people would knock on the door at night asking for a piece of bread or a handful of flour. People stopped caring about the bombardment. They said, 'If I die, I will find peace.' ""Emotionally everyone was broken. Every second you lived was more difficult than the one before. The situation was desperate and we had to get out."" Abu Ahmed borrowed a car from a friend. He took his first family to safety and then returned for his second - his new wife and baby daughter, Leylas. ""That journey was hell. We left after sunset in the last convoy out of the city,"" he says. ""At one point a missile hit the road right in front of us. There was dust everywhere. I had Leylas in my arms. We were shaking, but we were alive. All we could do was brush off the dust and keep moving."" Once the government retook eastern Aleppo in December 2016, Zahed Tajeddin was finally able to return. He found deserted streets and smashed buildings, rubble and wreckage everywhere. Many familiar places - his tailor, his barber, a nearby school and mosque - had been destroyed. Homeless people sleep in the ruins Many of the beautiful arches have been destroyed People return to their homes to salvage what they can His house remained standing, but in the few days that separated Abu Ahmed's hurried departure and Tajeddin's return it had been ransacked and looted. Even the kitchen taps and an iron bed frame had been stripped away. Among the debris Tajeddin spotted family photos, old letters, childhood paintings. In places, piles of medicine also littered the floor. ""I went in and it was complete chaos. It was like doing my own archaeology,"" he says. ""It's very grim now, but the house - the walls, the courtyard, the plants, honeysuckles and one jasmine tree - it's still there."" Tajeddin has locked up the house now and is unsure if, or when, he'll go back. Abu Ahmed is still in Syria, living in another city with his two wives and five children. He is trying to set up another pharmacy there, but he misses the city of his birth. ""My everything is in Aleppo,"" he says. ""The best moments in my life I have spent in Aleppo. Bittersweet memories. But even in the darkest days, even under the bombs, I'd rather live in Aleppo than anywhere else."" As Tajeddin left the locked house in Judaydah on his last visit he passed the jasmine in the courtyard. ""It was winter so the jasmine was overgrown,"" he says. ""It was still green, and do you know funny enough before I left, I saw a flower blooming. I think there was the first flower.""

"There has always been a shared conceit at the heart of the special relationship between the United States and United Kingdom that global leadership is best expressed and exerted in English. More boastful than the Brits, successive US presidents have trumpeted the notion of American exceptionalism. Prime ministers, in a more understated manner, have also come to believe in British exceptionalism, the idea that Westminster is the mother parliament, and that the UK has a governing model and liberal values that set the global standard for others to follow, not least its former colonies. In the post-war Anglo-American order those ideas came together. In many ways, it was the product of Anglo-American exceptionalist thinking: the ""city upon a hill"" meets ""this sceptred isle"". Nato, the IMF, the World Bank and the Five Eyes intelligence community all stemmed from the Atlantic Charter signed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in August 1941. The liberalised free trade system that flourished after the war is often called the Anglo-Saxon model. The post-world global architecture, diplomatic, mercantile and financial, was largely an English-speaking construct. In recent weeks, however, the Anglo-American order has looked increasingly weak and wobbly. The unexpectedly messy result of the British election makes it look still more fragile, like a historic edifice left tottering in the wake of a major quake. There is uncertainty in Westminster, and something nearing chaos in Washington because of Russian probe at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Neither Britain nor America can boast strong and stable governments. Neither have the look of global exemplars. In the six weeks since Theresa May called her snap election, the global tectonic plates have shifted fast, leaving Britain and America increasingly adrift. Donald Trump, during his first international trip, refused to publicly endorse Article V of the Nato treaty and publicly scolded his allies over financial burden sharing. He found himself isolated at the G7 summit in Sicily. Then, on his return to Washington, came the announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, a decision of massive planetary and geopolitical import. Hung Parliament: What happens now? A simple guide to the UK election result How the world reacted Here, America First meant America alone, and Trump seemed to revel in his neo-isolationism - as he did when he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership early in his presidency. For Britain, the diplomatic impact of Brexit has also become clearer in recent weeks. EU leaders have bluntly outlined how they will set the terms of the divorce settlement, in what looks more and more like a diktat than an amicable separation. The 27 remaining members of the EU have also made it clear they intend to penalise the UK. When Jean-Claude Juncker met Theresa May at Downing Street shortly after she called the election, he was evidently dismayed by her approach. ""I'm leaving Downing Street 10 times more sceptical than I was before,"" the EU Commission president reportedly informed his host. As one senior EU diplomat put it to me: ""Britain has shot itself in one foot. We intend to shoot you in the other."" The British prime minister, by failing to win an election she didn't have to call, has weakened her bargaining position still further. Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt has already called the UK election: ""Yet another own goal."" In recent weeks it is not only the UK's relations with the EU that have become more strained. Its cherished trans-Atlantic alliance has also been subject to some unforeseen stress tests. I never expected to report that Britain would stop sharing sensitive intelligence with the United States, but that was the story we broke in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing. Then, following the London attack, came Donald Trump's Twitter assault on the London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Again, in the pre-Trump world it would have been unthinkable for a US President to mount such a vicious attack on a British mayor in the wake of a UK terror attack. Sir Christopher Meyer, Britain's former ambassador in Washington, seemed to capture the public mood when he noted: ""Trump makes me puke."" The prime minister steered clear of delivering a stiff public rebuke to the President over his attack on Mayor Khan, presumably out of fear of angering Donald Trump and jeopardising a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Perhaps this also explained why she didn't join with Germany, France and Italy in signing a joint declaration slamming Trump's Paris decision. This video can not be played Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test But again that emphasises Britain's weakness. The special relationship has always been an asymmetrical relationship but now it seems even more lop-sided. It speaks of the UK's post-Brexit diplomacy of desperation. The trans-Atlantic alliance will eventually have to deal with a longer-term problem that will outlast the Trump administration. One of Britain's great uses to Washington in recent decades has been as a bridge to the European Union. It's why Barack Obama lobbied so hard for a 'remain' vote ahead of last year's referendum. Under future US presidents, it is easy to imagine a German-American alliance supplanting the special relationship. Voids in global leadership are immediately filled, and we've seen that happen at warp speed over the past few weeks. Brexit has galvanised the European Union. The election of Emmanuel Macron has revitalised the Franco-German alliance, giving it a more youthful and dynamic look. Post-Paris, a green alliance has emerged between Beijing and Brussels. More broadly, China sees the chance to extend its sphere of influence, positioning itself on environmental issues as the international pace-setter. Even before Mr Trump took the oath of office, this looked more likely to be the Asian Century rather than a repeat of the American Century. Europe eyes an enhanced role for itself, too. ""We Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands,"" declared Angela Merkel during a speech in a Bavarian beer hall after the disastrous G7 summit. In a pointed dig at America and Britain, she also warned that the days when Germany could completely rely on others are ""over to a certain extent"". More and more, the German chancellor looks like the leader of the free world, something that would have required a massive leap of imagination in the years immediately after World War II, when the English-speaking liberal global order was taking shape. Winston Churchill, during the 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri, in which he coined the phrase ""special relationship"" (and also the ""iron curtain""), noted: ""It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose, and the grand simplicity of decision shall guide and rule the conduct of the English-speaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must, and I believe we shall, prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement."" Right now, both the United States and the United Kingdom seem to be failing that Churchillian test. These English-speaking nations no longer speak with such a clarion voice, and the rest of the world no longer takes such heed. A new world order seems to be emerging that is being articulated in other tongues.
