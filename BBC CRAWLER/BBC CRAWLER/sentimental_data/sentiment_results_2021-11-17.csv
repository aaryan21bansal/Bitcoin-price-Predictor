"Mamie Mitchell (left) and her lawyer Gloria Allred spoke to the media on Wednesday A lawsuit against Alec Baldwin alleges that a film script did not require him to fire a gun when he fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell - who called police after the shooting on the New Mexico film set - filed the suit. Her lawyer accused the actor of ""playing Russian roulette"" when he fired the gun without checking it. Mr Baldwin and the film's producers, who were also named in the lawsuit, have not yet commented. The Hollywood actor has previously shared commentsfrom a crew member rejecting suggestions that the film set was unsafe. Authorities are still investigating the 21 October shooting that took place on the set of the Western film Rust. No criminal charges have been brought against anyone. Ms Mitchell's lawsuit claims that the script called for three tight camera shots - one of Mr Baldwin's eyes, another of a bloodstain on his shoulder and a third of his torso ""as he reached his hand down to the holster and removed the gun"". ""There was nothing in the script about the gun being discharged by defendant Baldwin or by any other person,"" it says. EXPLAINER:What are the rules for guns on film sets? In a news conference on Wednesday, her lawyer Gloria Allred described the behaviour of Mr Baldwin and the film's producers as ""reckless"", as she accused them of failing to follow safety protocols. According to court records, Mr Baldwin was handed the weapon by the film's assistant director who did not know it contained live ammunition and indicated it was unloaded by shouting ""cold gun"". Ms Allred said Mr Baldwin ""chose to play Russian roulette when he fired a gun without checking it and without having the armourer do so in his presence"". She added that a range of safety failures meant that it was ""a case where injury or death was much more than just a possibility â it was a likely result"". Ms Mitchell was standing less than 4ft (1.2m) away from Mr Baldwin when the weapon was discharged, according to the lawsuit. ""I relive the shooting and the sound of the explosion from the gun over and over again,"" she told reporters. Her lawsuit is claiming assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and deliberate infliction of harm, and is requesting unspecified damages. It is the second to be filed over the incident, after the set's head electricianbegan legal action earlier this month. The film's armourer, who was responsible for the guns and ammunition on set, has said she does not know how a live round came to be in the weapon.

"MPs have backed government plans to prevent them taking on certain jobs in addition to their work in Parliament. Boris Johnson made a surprise announcement on the proposals on Tuesday amid sleaze allegations about Conservative MPs. Labour has been calling for a ban for sometime and tried to get MPs to back its plan which it said was tougher. But the government ordered its MPs to vote against the party's motion, defeating it by 51 votes. Under the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. This is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week as a reasonable limit. PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Johnson forced to act in sleaze row Which MPs have second jobs? In a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs. ""This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,"" it said. ""This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this."" But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had provided ""warm words"" instead of a ""plan of action"". His party wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants. And if the government did not then offer MPs a vote on these rules within 15 days, backbench MPs would gain the power to force one. Under the government's plan, the committee would come up with recommendations by the same date, but steps for implementing the recommendations are not set out. Labour ordered its MPs not to take part in the vote on the government's amendment, meaning it was passed by 297 to zero. On Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side. Or, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future... No 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day. And, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong. Will they get their way? Read more from Laura The vote comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson again admitted it had been a ""mistake"" to try and overhaul the standards system at the same time as potentially saving Owen Paterson from punishment for breaking the existing rules on second jobs. But the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by select committee chairs at the Commons Liaison Committee. However, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson told his MPs he had ""crashed the car"" in the way he had handled Mr Paterson's disciplinary case. Earlier, he was involved infurious exchanges with Sir Keir Starmerat Prime Minister's Questions, with the Labour leader branding him a ""coward"" over his stance on second jobs. In the debate on second job rules, called by Labour, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was important for MPs to ""maintain connections to the world beyond so that we may draw on the insight and expertise that this experience offers"". But he added that MPs ""should not be for sale"", saying: ""We are elected to Parliament on a promise to work for the greater good, not ourselves."" Labour MPs dismissed the argument that MPs need to be allowed to do extra work for real world experience, arguing that being an MP is a full time job. The party's shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said: ""There should be no MP taking money to be a political strategist, an assistant or some sort of corporate adviser. That should not happen."" Owen Paterson, who has resigned as an MP, denies breaking Commons lobbying rules Arguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Mr Paterson's case. The Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him. The government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed. But it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP. Appearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was ""extraordinary"" that some of his colleagues ""behave in these ways"". There's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do. The rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their Â£81,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster. So, MPs can continue to work in professions like the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy. But they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients. MPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer/client is involved, they have to declare an interest. Any breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons.

"The financial help poorer people get to cover their care will not count towards a new cap on costs, the government has said. It was announced in September that from 2023 no one in England would pay more than Â£86,000 in care fees during their lifetime. Now it has been confirmed that support payments from local councils will not count towards this personal limit. Labour said it makes the cap ""an even bigger con than we initially thought"". Critics also argue it will make the cap harder to reach than under a previous version suggested by an official commission a decade ago. But Boris Johnson has defended the government's plan, calling it a ""massive improvement"" on the current funding situation. MPs will vote on whether to support the plans next week. Will the cap really fix the social care system? Social care changes at-a-glance The cap on personal care costs is a central element of the government's plans to change how adult social care in England is funded. From October 2023, the idea is that no one will pay more than Â£86,000 over their lifetime for personal care, such as washing, dressing and eating. Once people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities. Money spent on living costs - such as food, energy bills and accommodation - would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will also be made more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The government did not specify in September whether people receiving these payments would be able to put them towards reaching the cap. But on Wednesday, itpublished guidance,externalconfirming that only payments people make out of their own pocket will count. Funding social care in England has been a long-running political issue This contrasts with a previous blueprint for how the cap should work, made by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in an official report in 2011. This was put into law in the 2014 Care Act under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron. Under Sir Andrew's recommendations, payments from local authorities would be used to reach the cap. He argued this was important to ensure poorer people receiving support for a long time did not just end up taking longer to reach the limit, rather than contributing less overall. Giving evidence to MPs on Thursday, Sir Andrew said he was ""very disappointed"" with the government plans announced on Wednesday. He told them that it will mean poorer people will only hit the cap ""significantly later"" and won't end up benefiting as much. ""It will tend to hit people in regions of the country with lower house prices harder than it does those in regions with higher house prices,"" he added. ""So there is a sort of North-South axis to this, that people living in northern and other less high house price areas are likely to be hit harder by this on average."" Chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, Torsten Bell, also criticised the move, saying the new version of the cap ""will now offer little protection to poorer households' assets, while doing much more for those with significant assets - especially in the south of England."" Director of policy at charity The Kings Fund, Sally Warren, also called the change ""disappointing"". She said those with low to moderate levels of wealth with be the worst affected, adding: ""They may well wonder why the prime minister's promise that no one need to sell their house to pay for care will benefit wealthier people but doesn't seem to apply to them."" Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow social care minister, said it showed ""Boris Johnson's so-called cap on care costs is an even bigger con than we initially thought."" ""It has now been revealed that the poorest pensioners will have to pay even more,"" she added. ""This Tory government has failed to be straight with those who've given so much to our country is a total disgrace, but utterly unsurprising. Our elderly people deserve better."" Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the government's plans would be a ""massive improvement for everybody in the whole country"". ""What we're saying is for the first time in history we're stopping people having to pay unlimited quantities for their care,"" he added.

"Amazon will stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK from 19 January, the online retail giant has said. It said the move was due to high credit card transaction fees but said Visa debit cards would still be accepted. Visa said it was ""very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future"". Amazon said: ""The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers."" The online retailer said costs should be going down over time due to advances in technology, ""but instead they continue to stay high or even rise"". An Amazon spokesperson said the dispute was to do with ""pretty egregious"" price rises from Visa over a number of years with no additional value to its service. Amazon is offering Â£20 for Prime customers to switch from using Visa to an alternative payment method, and Â£10 for other customers, if they have a Visa cards as their default or only payment method on their account. Visa said in a statement it was ""very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins."" It said it had ""a long-standing relationship with Amazon"" and that it was trying to resolve the situation so customers would be able to use Visa credit cards with Amazon UK. Amazon declined to say how much Visa charges the retailer to process transactions made on credit cards. Visa also declined to comment though it claimed that on average it takes less than 0.1% of the value of a purchase. Amazon and Visa said any changes in fees had nothing to do with Brexit. Both Visa and its rivalMastercard have raised the so-called interchange feeon cross-border transactions between businesses in the UK and the European Union following Brexit. The dispute between Amazon and Visa is to do with the fees the credit card company charges Amazon for its services in the UK. Amazon is also considering dropping Visa as a partner for its US co-branded credit card. It is in talks with payment networks, including Mastercard, American Express and Visa - as part of what it calls a standard process, the BBC has learnt. This row between two corporate titans is now being played out in full view of their customers. Amazon says Visa's fees are excessive, and an obstacle to low prices for consumers. Visa says its fees are competitive, has minimal effect on prices, and that nobody wins when choice is restricted. Whether or not this row is about fees, or whether that is just a smokescreen is largely irrelevant to consumers using these services. They just know they may have to change the way they pay on Amazon. Yet, the timing is significant. These messages to customers hit home harder when people are regularly using Amazon for Christmas shopping. But it also means there is still time before January 19 for a compromise to be reached. James Andrews, senior personal finance editor at comparison website Money.co.uk, said the move ""will come as a blow to the millions of Britons"" who use Visa credit cards, including Barclaycard and HSBC customers. ""With American Express also rejected by many UK retailers, that means people looking for rewards on their spending or trying to split the cost of shopping with a 0% purchase card on Amazon will be effectively forced to choose a Mastercard,"" he said. He added that a rewards card that is offered by Amazon is ""powered by Mastercard"". Mastercard's executive vice chairman Ann Cairns, said: ""It's very important that customers have choice, and have the widest variety of ability to pay, whether that's through cards or from their bank accounts or cash, and remember that it is never the consumer that pays fees."" ""We talk to Amazon all the time because obviously we are two big global businesses and Amazon is one of our top customers around the world."" Retail analyst Steve Dressersaid in a tweet,externalthat Amazon could be aiming to bring Visa fees down with its move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said credit card fees ""charged by the handful of card providers which dominate the cashless payment space have soared in recent years"". ""Small businesses are almost always charged more for card terminals than big corporates - so when online giants start throwing down the gauntlet, you know the situation is becoming critical,"" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Businesses have had ongoing concerns about credit card fees from the major providers. Last October, Visa and Mastercard wereaccused by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) of charging excessive fees. The trade body said they had doubled in two years. At the time, the BRC warned that retailers would be forced to pass on costs to consumers, with credit card bills rising by up to Â£40. The Payment Systems Regulator said there were ""real questions about how well the cards market is working"". ""We will look into how well this market is working, including the issue of increasing card fees,"" a spokesman for the regulator said. ""If necessary we will intervene to address any issues we identify."" He said a final strategy would be published in the new year. Visa shares ended Wednesday's New York trading day down by 4.7%.

"This video can not be played A survey found many students in Wales were living in substandard housing Students have recounted crying in front of landlords for help after living in houses filled with mould, damp, broken appliances and rats. One reported sitting an exam with a rat ""rustling"" about, and another said her mouldy ceiling had crumbled away. The National Union of Students has demanded urgent changes, saying landlords must be held to account. The Welsh government said sub-standard housing should be reported to the local authority. A survey of 300 students, carried out by NUS Wales and Shelter Cymru, found more than half reported living with damp or mould, with 24% reporting problems with rats and vermin. Almost two-thirds said poor living standards were affecting their mental health. The charities warned the issues had been exacerbated by having to spend more time in their homes and rooms during lockdown. One student said landlords ""seem to think students deserve to live in a damp house with broken appliances"", another that ""students are expected to live in awful conditions just because it's the 'student way of living"". Ms Staroscik said her friends were crying in front of letting agents but felt ""they didn't care"" When photojournalism student Dominika Staroscik picked up the keys to her house share in Cardiff, in July 2020, she was looking forward to living with friends. But when she got there, the house, which they had not been able to view because of lockdown, looked different from the photos. ""I just looked around and I just burst into tears,"" said Ms Staroscik, who graduated this year from the University of South Wales. ""I was just so shocked how dirty everything was. You could tell it hadn't been cleaned, this was years of dust building up."" The 21-year-old said there was mould in the bedrooms, including her own. There was a hole in the ceiling which started crumbling after days of rain.

""I woke up one morning and I literally had paint from the ceiling over my face,"" Ms Staroscik said. She claimed the maintenance manager told her it was not a safe place to live, and they would have to find somewhere else to stay. ""We just both broke down,"" she said. The group complained for months about the Â£900 a month property. Ms Staroscik said fire alarms were not working, there was a mouldy sofa and appliances were covered in rust. Ms Staroscik counted down the days to her departure. ""I just wanted to feel comfortable, I felt the complete opposite,"" she said. Edward Drake had to keep his clothes in his car due to damp in his shared house Edward Drake, a second year student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said he had to keep his clothes in his car due to the amount of damp in his house share. ""The closet in the room is on the wall, and that's damp, so I can't keep my clothes in there,"" he said. He said trying to deal with damp had been ""disruptive."" The landlord tried to fix it but it came back. Laura Chapman said there was rust and damp everywhere in her home Laura Chapman, from Bath, is studying a visual journalism masters, and lives with four women in Cardiff. The 21-year-old found her property online where it looked nice. Unable to view it because of Covid she took a chance. It looked ""nothing"" like expected. And on her sofa there was mould Nothing had been cleaned, she said, there was rust and damp everywhere, no flush on the toilet, and windows that didn't close. Ms Chapman said: ""We told them on the first day what the problems were, but they had no urgency to fix it."" After three months living with damp she was worried about their health. ""It's not a nice atmosphere to do work or live in,"" she said. NUS Wales President Becky Ricketts want to bust the myth should have to put up with bad housing Student accommodation has always been associated with ""low quality, high costs and dodgy landlords"" NUS Wales President, Becky Ricketts said. ""We have to bust the myth that students should have to put up with housing horror stories as a rite of passage,"" she said. ""Our asks are basic: for all students to be protected equally, for all students to be able to hold their landlords to account, and for all students to be able to afford to live in safe and decent housing."" Shelter Cymru's Rob Simkins said poor housing could dent future life chances Shelter Cymru campaigns manager, Rob Simkins, said living in poor housing as a student could dent future life chances. ""Until we address that culture, until we figure out where these issues are and how we solve them, we're still going to see these impacts and that's only going to widen inequalities in our society,"" he said. A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""We remain committed to implementing the measures outlined in the Renting Homes Act (2016) - which last year was amended to improve security of tenure - by the summer of next year. ""No-one should have to live in poor housing, and any tenants affected should report sub-standard accommodation to their local authority. ""If any students are concerned about their living conditions, they are strongly advised to speak to their accommodation officer or raise concerns with their landlords.""

The National Union of Students has demanded urgent changes, saying landlords must be held to account. The Welsh government said sub-standard housing should be reported to the local authority. A survey of 300 students, carried out by NUS Wales and Shelter Cymru, found more than half reported living with damp or mould, with 24% reporting problems with rats and vermin. Almost two-thirds said poor living standards were affecting their mental health. The charities warned the issues had been exacerbated by having to spend more time in their homes and rooms during lockdown. One student said landlords ""seem to think students deserve to live in a damp house with broken appliances"", another that ""students are expected to live in awful conditions just because it's the 'student way of living"". Ms Staroscik said her friends were crying in front of letting agents but felt ""they didn't care"" When photojournalism student Dominika Staroscik picked up the keys to her house share in Cardiff, in July 2020, she was looking forward to living with friends. But when she got there, the house, which they had not been able to view because of lockdown, looked different from the photos. ""I just looked around and I just burst into tears,"" said Ms Staroscik, who graduated this year from the University of South Wales. ""I was just so shocked how dirty everything was. You could tell it hadn't been cleaned, this was years of dust building up."" The 21-year-old said there was mould in the bedrooms, including her own. There was a hole in the ceiling which started crumbling after days of rain. University offers less likely for more diverse students Teaching delays 'another blow' for uni students Covid: Â£40m for Wales' university students amid rent outcry The NUS said students were living in properties with serious mould and damage Water leaked into her room. ""I woke up one morning and I literally had paint from the ceiling over my face,"" Ms Staroscik said. She claimed the maintenance manager told her it was not a safe place to live, and they would have to find somewhere else to stay. ""We just both broke down,"" she said. The group complained for months about the Â£900 a month property. Ms Staroscik said fire alarms were not working, there was a mouldy sofa and appliances were covered in rust. Ms Staroscik counted down the days to her departure. ""I just wanted to feel comfortable, I felt the complete opposite,"" she said. Edward Drake had to keep his clothes in his car due to damp in his shared house Edward Drake, a second year student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said he had to keep his clothes in his car due to the amount of damp in his house share. ""The closet in the room is on the wall, and that's damp, so I can't keep my clothes in there,"" he said. He said trying to deal with damp had been ""disruptive."" The landlord tried to fix it but it came back. Laura Chapman said there was rust and damp everywhere in her home Laura Chapman, from Bath, is studying a visual journalism masters, and lives with four women in Cardiff. The 21-year-old found her property online where it looked nice. Unable to view it because of Covid she took a chance. It looked ""nothing"" like expected. And on her sofa there was mould Nothing had been cleaned, she said, there was rust and damp everywhere, no flush on the toilet, and windows that didn't close. Ms Chapman said: ""We told them on the first day what the problems were, but they had no urgency to fix it."" After three months living with damp she was worried about their health. ""It's not a nice atmosphere to do work or live in,"" she said. NUS Wales President Becky Ricketts want to bust the myth should have to put up with bad housing Student accommodation has always been associated with ""low quality, high costs and dodgy landlords"" NUS Wales President, Becky Ricketts said. ""We have to bust the myth that students should have to put up with housing horror stories as a rite of passage,"" she said. ""Our asks are basic: for all students to be protected equally, for all students to be able to hold their landlords to account, and for all students to be able to afford to live in safe and decent housing."" Shelter Cymru's Rob Simkins said poor housing could dent future life chances Shelter Cymru campaigns manager, Rob Simkins, said living in poor housing as a student could dent future life chances. ""Until we address that culture, until we figure out where these issues are and how we solve them, we're still going to see these impacts and that's only going to widen inequalities in our society,"" he said. A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""We remain committed to implementing the measures outlined in the Renting Homes Act (2016) - which last year was amended to improve security of tenure - by the summer of next year. ""No-one should have to live in poor housing, and any tenants affected should report sub-standard accommodation to their local authority. ""If any students are concerned about their living conditions, they are strongly advised to speak to their accommodation officer or raise concerns with their landlords."" Rent Smart Wales, a national scheme for driving up standards in the private rented sector, said students with concerns about their landlord should get in touch with them.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised for saying a ""significant cloud"" hung over the name of the late bishop of Chichester. In 1995, a woman alleged the Rt Rev George Bell, who died in 1958, had sexually abused her when she was a girl. The police were called in only after she wrote to the archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in 2013. The Church settled with her out of court, in 2015, and issued an apology. However, a review of the case, in 2017, said the Church had ""rushed to judgement"" in assuming Bishop Bell's guilt. On Wednesday, Archbishop Welby released a personal statement, saying he did not ""consider there to be a 'significant cloud' over Bishop George Bell's name"". While insisting allegations of abuse ""must be taken seriously"", he added, ""we also owe a duty of care to those who are accused"". Bishop Bell was bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death, in 1958, and was praised for his criticism of the RAF bombing of German civilians in World War Two. He also played a part in organising the Kindertransport rescue, of Jewish children from the Nazis. He was later honoured with an official Anglican holy day dedicated to his life. In 1995, a woman alleged Bishop Bell had abused her when she was a little girl - but that claim was not initially investigated. In 2013, the complainant, known only as Carol, wrote to Archbishop Welby and the matter was referred to the police. The Rt Rev George Bell was bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death, in 1958 In 2015, the Church of England paid Â£16,800 in an out-of-court settlement and apologised. However a review, in 2017, by Lord Carlile QC, criticised the Church for a ""rush to judgement"" in assuming Bishop Bell's guilt and said it had not been fair to both sides. The bishop had been ""hung out to dry"" and the ""truth of what Carol was saying was implicitly accepted without serious investigation or inquiry"", Lord Carlile said. However, in the aftermath of Lord Carlile's report, Archbishop Welby refused to exonerate Bishop Bell and said, in January 2018, a ""significant cloud is left over his name"". ""Bishop Bell was in many ways a hero. He is also accused of great wickedness. No human being is entirely good or bad,"" Archbishop Welby said at the time. Later in 2018, the Church said publicly it had referred ""fresh information"" to Sussex Police. A subsequent review said there was no evidence behind these latest claims. In Wednesday's personal statement, Archbishop Welby said the ""Church is on a journey of thoroughgoing repentance"" for previously ignoring claims of abuse. ""This is why the posthumous allegations made against Bishop George Bell were taken seriously and investigated fully,"" he said. ""What I say today that is new and should have been said sooner is this, 'I do not consider there to be a 'significant cloud' over Bishop George Bell's name.' ""Previously, I refused to retract that statement and I was wrong to do so. I took that view because of the importance we rightly place on listening to those who come forward with allegations of abuse and the duty of care we owe to them. ""But we also owe a duty of care to those who are accused. I apologise for the hurt that my refusal to retract that statement has caused to Bishop Bell's surviving relatives, colleagues and longstanding supporters. ""They have all raised this issue, often powerfully, and I have recognised my error as a result of their advocacy."" Archbishop Welby praised Bishop Bell as ""one of the most courageous, distinguished Anglican bishops of the past century"". ""The debt owed to him extends far beyond the Church that he served and is one that we share as a society,"" he said.

"MPs have voted in favour of new rules to curb what extra work they are allowed to do, amid the row about second jobs Johnson announced plans on Tuesday to stop MPs working as political consultants The Commons rejected a Labour motion on how to bring in the new rules, instead backing the government's plan Earlier, Boris Johnson was quizzed about second jobs at PMQs and by senior MPs on the Liaison Committee The PM admitted the government made a mistake by conflating the Owen Paterson row with his plan to overhaul the disciplinary process Labour's Keir Starmer accused the PM of being a ""coward"" for not apologising for his role in the Paterson row Edited by Francesca Gillett Thanks for following our live updates today. Today's live coverage was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, Francesca Gillett, Adam Durbin, Joseph Lee, Justin Parkinson, Paul Seddon and Kate Whannel. This is where we end our coverage of the goings-on in Parliament. Here is a round-up of the day's events:  This video can not be played Earlier today at the Liaison Committee, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt asked the prime minister if Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe could be home by Christmas. She is currently detained in Iran after being arrested five years ago, accused of plotting to overthrow the government, which she denies. The prime minister said it was a difficult case and it ""breaks my heart"" that he could not guarantee when Nazanin would be home with her husband and daughter. You can watch their exchange above. The government's alternative proposal has been backed by MPs, with 297 voting in favour and none against. Labour's motion has
been defeated. MPs are now voting on the government's alternative proposal. Like Labourâs
motion, the government amendment wants the standards committee to come up with
recommendations by the end of January which would prevent MPs from accepting paid work as a consultant. The government plan also asks the committee to produce proposals stating that ""any outside activity
undertaken by a MP should be within
reasonable limits and should not prevent them from fully carrying out their
range of duties."" However, unlike Labour's motion, it does not
specify what would happen once the committee produces its recommendations. MPs have rejected the second jobs motion from Labour. 231 MPs voted for the motion and 282 voted against. The debate on MPs' second jobs has come to an end and the voting is beginning. MPs will first vote on Labour's proposal. Their motion would order the standards committee to design rules by 31 January aimed at banning MPs from working as political consultants. Their motion also ensures MPs would get a vote on bringing in these rules, shortly after the committee publishes its recommendations. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor After PMQs and the Liaison Committee, the PM then went to face his own MPs at the 1922 committee - one texts to say, he ""looked weak and sounded weak"" and ""authority is evaporating"". Other MPs leaving the meeting of Tories where the PM was speaking: ""He needs a lemsip"", ""excellent"", ""muted"" and ""fair to say it's been a rough couple of weeks"". The House of Commons is currently debating Labour and Conservative plans to change the system of rules on MPs' second jobs. And they're both fairly complex. Labour's motion would order Parliament's standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January, designed to bring in a ban on MPs working as political consultants. The motion also says that, if the government doesn't grant MPs a vote on these new rules within 15 days of that date, backbench MPs would get the power to force one. But the government has proposed an alternative plan. Its amendment to the motion would still see the committee coming up with recommendations by the same date - 31 January - but what happens next is left unclear. The votes are expected soon. Labour MP Zarah Sultana talks about her surprise on becoming an MP in 2019, and seeing the gifts and dinners that companies lavish on parliamentarians to influence them. One of them was Heathrow Airport, which sent a food hamper to encourage MPs to vote for a third runway, she says. ""I was surprised to walk down corridor where big businesses host
dinners for MPs. Over a glass of fine wine and a big meal, they extend their influence,"" she says. Quoting a quip by former Bolsover MP Dennis Skinner, she says fact-finding missions paid for by business are always to destinations like the Bahamas in winter - not Greenland. MPs are already in the UK's top 5% of earners, but for some that is not enough, Sultana says. With both of the UK's largest political parties debating their plans to reform to the rules around what second roles MPs can hold, it might be a good time to remind ourselves what the existing system allows. Currently MPs are allowed to take on a second role, as long as they are not a government minister. They must publicly declare any additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%. Those who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving. They are banned from lobbying the government for two years as well. In addition, all MPs are ""strictly forbidden"" from being paid for ""advocating a particular matter"" in Parliament. Read more here. Conservative MP Danny Kruger says former colleague Owen Paterson - who has quit Parliament after being found to have broken rules on lobbying - is his friend. He adds that Paterson has done ""good service to the state"" - but does not defend his actions on behalf of two companies that prompted the current row over second jobs. Reality Check At PMQs earlier, Boris Johnson repeatedly
referred to Sir Keir Starmerâs earnings as a lawyer and, in particular, money
heâd been paid by law firm Mishcon de Reya since he was elected to Parliament
in 2015. Starmer's entries in the MPs' register of interests show he
was paid Â£7,060 by Mishcon de Reya for legal advice in December 2015, and Â£4,500 per month between June and September in 2016 for legal advice to
the Mishcon de Reya Academy, which provides training. In total, Sir Keir has earned over Â£100,000 from his legal
work since becoming an MP, although none since he became Labour leader last year. Some of the payments he has received have come from
sources that are not named in the register. Starmer says the sources of
those payments werenât named to protect client confidentiality. The Labour leader says he gave up his practising
certificate nearly two years ago, so he is no longer able to give legal advice. After PMQs and a marathon questioning by senior MPs, Boris Johnson might have been hoping the day's parliamentary wrangling was over. But debate over a Labour party motion on second jobs has been well under way for a couple of hours now. The opposition day motion on standards in public life was called after Labour unveiled its plans to ban extra jobs for MPs - unless they are public service roles - on Tuesday. But as the party announced the proposals, the prime minister revealed his own, echoing Labour's call - but one which the opposition described as merely a ""watered down"" version of their plan from the government. Following the debate MPs will vote on the two plans, expected at around 19:00. Read more about what is happening in Westminster tonight here. Meanwhile, back in the Commons, MPs continue to debate proposed changes to rules surrounding their ability to work second jobs. Tory MP Mark Fletcher says recent headlines about MPs' second jobs ""simply reinforce"" what the public feels about politicians. But he argues this is unfair and urges Labour and other opposition parties to ""dial down the mud-slinging"" against Conservatives. You can read more on the current rules for MPs' second jobshere. This video can not be played Chris Bryant challenges Johnson over MPs' standards That was lengthy session of the Liaison Committee. Here are some of the highlights: The questioning of Boris Johnson has now ended, with chair Bernard Jenkin thanking the prime minister for his time and generosity in attending the Liaison Committee for the third and final time this year. Johnson indignantly points out this is in fact the fourth time he has been grilled by the committee chairs, after a session was delayed from last year. The PM adds he will see them in 2022 - a prospect he is no doubt relishing! Thanks for sticking with us, we'll have a summary of the afternoon's events with you shortly. Jeremy Hunt, who is also a former health secretary, then asks about efforts to fill a vacancies in the NHS, which he says now stands at 93,000. He asks whether the government will back a proposal to introduce independent estimates every year for the number of doctors that need to be recruited. Boris Johnson says he is ""happy to study"" the idea, but the government has its own targets. He admits there are shortages in ""many key areas"". Richard Ratcliffe, husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, recently spent 21 days on a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office Last but not least is Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee. The former foreign secretary asks about thecase of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He says Iran has linked her release to the UK's repayment of a historic debt - and asks whether only the UK will decide on this. Boris Johnson says in an ""ideal world"" the UK would be able to resolve the issue by repaying the debt, but things are more ""complicated"" than that. He adds that he continues to be ""horrified"" by how she has been treated and the government is working ""as hard as we can"" to secure her release. He adds that it ""breaks his heart"" that he cannot guarantee, however, she will be home for Christmas. ""Are you responsible for empty shelves in Supermarkets,"" asks MacNeil. The PM says he is responsible for ""trying to help improve supply chains"". He says the problem is caused by global factors such as a shortage of HGV drivers. Has Brexit made it worse, asks the SNP MP. ""It is a pan-European problem,"" the PM replies adding that working conditions for HGV drivers should be improved. Committee chair Bernard Jenkin jokes that he could renew his HGV licence if it would help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"MPs have backed government plans to prevent them taking on certain jobs in addition to their work in Parliament. Boris Johnson made a surprise announcement on the proposals on Tuesday amid sleaze allegations about Conservative MPs. Labour has been calling for a ban for sometime and tried to get MPs to back its plan which it said was tougher. But the government ordered its MPs to vote against the party's motion, defeating it by 51 votes. Under the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. This is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week as a reasonable limit. PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Johnson forced to act in sleaze row Which MPs have second jobs? In a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs. ""This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,"" it said. ""This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this."" But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had provided ""warm words"" instead of a ""plan of action"". His party wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants. And if the government did not then offer MPs a vote on these rules within 15 days, backbench MPs would gain the power to force one. Under the government's plan, the committee would come up with recommendations by the same date, but steps for implementing the recommendations are not set out. Labour ordered its MPs not to take part in the vote on the government's amendment, meaning it was passed by 297 to zero. On Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side. Or, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future... No 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day. And, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong. Will they get their way? Read more from Laura The vote comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson again admitted it had been a ""mistake"" to try and overhaul the standards system at the same time as potentially saving Owen Paterson from punishment for breaking the existing rules on second jobs. But the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by select committee chairs at the Commons Liaison Committee. However, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson told his MPs he had ""crashed the car"" in the way he had handled Mr Paterson's disciplinary case. Earlier, he was involved infurious exchanges with Sir Keir Starmerat Prime Minister's Questions, with the Labour leader branding him a ""coward"" over his stance on second jobs. In the debate on second job rules, called by Labour, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was important for MPs to ""maintain connections to the world beyond so that we may draw on the insight and expertise that this experience offers"". But he added that MPs ""should not be for sale"", saying: ""We are elected to Parliament on a promise to work for the greater good, not ourselves."" Labour MPs dismissed the argument that MPs need to be allowed to do extra work for real world experience, arguing that being an MP is a full time job. The party's shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said: ""There should be no MP taking money to be a political strategist, an assistant or some sort of corporate adviser. That should not happen."" Owen Paterson, who has resigned as an MP, denies breaking Commons lobbying rules Arguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Mr Paterson's case. The Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him. The government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed. But it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP. Appearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was ""extraordinary"" that some of his colleagues ""behave in these ways"". There's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do. The rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their Â£81,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster. So, MPs can continue to work in professions like the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy. But they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients. MPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer/client is involved, they have to declare an interest. Any breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised for saying a ""significant cloud"" hung over the name of the late bishop of Chichester. In 1995, a woman alleged the Rt Rev George Bell, who died in 1958, had sexually abused her when she was a girl. The police were called in only after she wrote to the archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in 2013. The Church settled with her out of court, in 2015, and issued an apology. However, a review of the case, in 2017, said the Church had ""rushed to judgement"" in assuming Bishop Bell's guilt. On Wednesday, Archbishop Welby released a personal statement, saying he did not ""consider there to be a 'significant cloud' over Bishop George Bell's name"". While insisting allegations of abuse ""must be taken seriously"", he added, ""we also owe a duty of care to those who are accused"". Bishop Bell was bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death, in 1958, and was praised for his criticism of the RAF bombing of German civilians in World War Two. He also played a part in organising the Kindertransport rescue, of Jewish children from the Nazis. He was later honoured with an official Anglican holy day dedicated to his life. In 1995, a woman alleged Bishop Bell had abused her when she was a little girl - but that claim was not initially investigated. In 2013, the complainant, known only as Carol, wrote to Archbishop Welby and the matter was referred to the police. The Rt Rev George Bell was bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death, in 1958 In 2015, the Church of England paid Â£16,800 in an out-of-court settlement and apologised. However a review, in 2017, by Lord Carlile QC, criticised the Church for a ""rush to judgement"" in assuming Bishop Bell's guilt and said it had not been fair to both sides. The bishop had been ""hung out to dry"" and the ""truth of what Carol was saying was implicitly accepted without serious investigation or inquiry"", Lord Carlile said. However, in the aftermath of Lord Carlile's report, Archbishop Welby refused to exonerate Bishop Bell and said, in January 2018, a ""significant cloud is left over his name"". ""Bishop Bell was in many ways a hero. He is also accused of great wickedness. No human being is entirely good or bad,"" Archbishop Welby said at the time. Later in 2018, the Church said publicly it had referred ""fresh information"" to Sussex Police. A subsequent review said there was no evidence behind these latest claims. In Wednesday's personal statement, Archbishop Welby said the ""Church is on a journey of thoroughgoing repentance"" for previously ignoring claims of abuse. ""This is why the posthumous allegations made against Bishop George Bell were taken seriously and investigated fully,"" he said. ""What I say today that is new and should have been said sooner is this, 'I do not consider there to be a 'significant cloud' over Bishop George Bell's name.' ""Previously, I refused to retract that statement and I was wrong to do so. I took that view because of the importance we rightly place on listening to those who come forward with allegations of abuse and the duty of care we owe to them. ""But we also owe a duty of care to those who are accused. I apologise for the hurt that my refusal to retract that statement has caused to Bishop Bell's surviving relatives, colleagues and longstanding supporters. ""They have all raised this issue, often powerfully, and I have recognised my error as a result of their advocacy."" Archbishop Welby praised Bishop Bell as ""one of the most courageous, distinguished Anglican bishops of the past century"". ""The debt owed to him extends far beyond the Church that he served and is one that we share as a society,"" he said. ""I am delighted that the statue to him that was planned will be erected on the west front of Canterbury Cathedral.""

"Israel has ordered 50 F-35s The US-made F-35 stealth fighter has seen its first ever combat action, flying in an operation for the Israeli air force. The air force chief showed an image of jets over Beirut, Lebanon, and said the planes had ""already attacked twice on two different fronts"". Israel recently carried out scores of air strikes in Syria. The F-35,external, from the world's priciest military programme, has been criticised both for cost and combat effectiveness. Last year,Defence Secretary James Mattishad to defend the programme after then President-elect Donald Trump tweeted criticising its huge price, said to be close to $100m (Â£74m) per plane. Maj Gen Amikam Norkin told heads of 20 foreign air forces meeting in Israel: ""We are flying the F-35 all over the Middle East and have already attacked twice on two different fronts."" He did not specify the targets. ""You know that we just won the Eurovision with the song 'Toy.' Well, the F-35 is not a toy,"" he said. Israel, the first country outside the US to acquire the single-seat fighter, has received nine of the 50 F-35s it has so far ordered, and could take up to 75. In Israel it is referred to by its Hebrew name ""Adir"" (Mighty). The jets are believed to be the F-35A variant - conventional takeoff and landing. The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says Israel's claim to have used it in an operational strike even before the Americans may be designed as a further show of military strength, as it believes elite Iranian forces are trying to entrench themselves in Syria to threaten Israel. This video can not be played Syrian state TV footage shows Israeli missiles over Damascus Israel saidits recent air strikes inside Syria targeted Iranian military infrastructure, in response to rocket fire aimed at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights. Iran has hundreds of personnel in Syria, who it says serve as military advisers to the Syrian army. It has also sent thousands of volunteer fighters in support of the Syrian government. The US has given Israel more military aid than any other country in the world - currently around $4bn a year - and its laws on arms sales require that Israel always maintains military superiority in the Middle East. Developed by Lockheed Martin and first flown in 2006, the main reason for the fighter is its versatility, projected to serve the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy in one design Three variants: conventional takeoff (A); short takeoff and vertical landing (B) and carrier-based catapult (C) Stealth is clearly a key factor, its airframe and design materials allow pilots to penetrate areas without being detected by radar This gives it a small radar cross-section, which is said to allow it to engage enemy aircraft before they see it. A helmet-mounted display system means the jet does not have to be pointing at its target to fire weapons But it's the sensors, communications and avionics that it trumpets the most - data is shared immediately with operational commanders, and pilots can track the enemy, jam radars and thwart attacks Israel has praised the Lockheed Martin F-35 as a ""game-changer"". This may not even be its first use by Israel. Its military is often quiet about its operations and there were reports that the stealth fighter had been used operationally as early as January last year. The US has certainly put a lot of faith in a programme that is expected to run through to 2070 and is projected to cost $1.5tn by then. However, it has also come in for heavy criticism and not just over the price. An influential military blog in 2015 reported that the F-35 lacked manoeuvrability and was unable to beat an F-16 in a dogfight. It was also reported to have cockpit visibility issues. Analysts say the emphasis on stealth capabilities may have compromised air-to-air effectiveness. Israel hits Iranian targets in Syria.

"MPs have voted in favour of new rules to curb what extra work they are allowed to do, amid the row about second jobs Johnson announced plans on Tuesday to stop MPs working as political consultants The Commons rejected a Labour motion on how to bring in the new rules, instead backing the government's plan Earlier, Boris Johnson was quizzed about second jobs at PMQs and by senior MPs on the Liaison Committee The PM admitted the government made a mistake by conflating the Owen Paterson row with his plan to overhaul the disciplinary process Labour's Keir Starmer accused the PM of being a ""coward"" for not apologising for his role in the Paterson row Edited by Francesca Gillett Thanks for following our live updates today. Today's live coverage was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, Francesca Gillett, Adam Durbin, Joseph Lee, Justin Parkinson, Paul Seddon and Kate Whannel. This is where we end our coverage of the goings-on in Parliament. Here is a round-up of the day's events:  This video can not be played Earlier today at the Liaison Committee, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt asked the prime minister if Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe could be home by Christmas. She is currently detained in Iran after being arrested five years ago, accused of plotting to overthrow the government, which she denies. The prime minister said it was a difficult case and it ""breaks my heart"" that he could not guarantee when Nazanin would be home with her husband and daughter. You can watch their exchange above. The government's alternative proposal has been backed by MPs, with 297 voting in favour and none against. Labour's motion has
been defeated. MPs are now voting on the government's alternative proposal. Like Labourâs
motion, the government amendment wants the standards committee to come up with
recommendations by the end of January which would prevent MPs from accepting paid work as a consultant. The government plan also asks the committee to produce proposals stating that ""any outside activity
undertaken by a MP should be within
reasonable limits and should not prevent them from fully carrying out their
range of duties."" However, unlike Labour's motion, it does not
specify what would happen once the committee produces its recommendations. MPs have rejected the second jobs motion from Labour. 231 MPs voted for the motion and 282 voted against. The debate on MPs' second jobs has come to an end and the voting is beginning. MPs will first vote on Labour's proposal. Their motion would order the standards committee to design rules by 31 January aimed at banning MPs from working as political consultants. Their motion also ensures MPs would get a vote on bringing in these rules, shortly after the committee publishes its recommendations. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor After PMQs and the Liaison Committee, the PM then went to face his own MPs at the 1922 committee - one texts to say, he ""looked weak and sounded weak"" and ""authority is evaporating"". Other MPs leaving the meeting of Tories where the PM was speaking: ""He needs a lemsip"", ""excellent"", ""muted"" and ""fair to say it's been a rough couple of weeks"". The House of Commons is currently debating Labour and Conservative plans to change the system of rules on MPs' second jobs. And they're both fairly complex. Labour's motion would order Parliament's standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January, designed to bring in a ban on MPs working as political consultants. The motion also says that, if the government doesn't grant MPs a vote on these new rules within 15 days of that date, backbench MPs would get the power to force one. But the government has proposed an alternative plan. Its amendment to the motion would still see the committee coming up with recommendations by the same date - 31 January - but what happens next is left unclear. The votes are expected soon. Labour MP Zarah Sultana talks about her surprise on becoming an MP in 2019, and seeing the gifts and dinners that companies lavish on parliamentarians to influence them. One of them was Heathrow Airport, which sent a food hamper to encourage MPs to vote for a third runway, she says. ""I was surprised to walk down corridor where big businesses host
dinners for MPs. Over a glass of fine wine and a big meal, they extend their influence,"" she says. Quoting a quip by former Bolsover MP Dennis Skinner, she says fact-finding missions paid for by business are always to destinations like the Bahamas in winter - not Greenland. MPs are already in the UK's top 5% of earners, but for some that is not enough, Sultana says. With both of the UK's largest political parties debating their plans to reform to the rules around what second roles MPs can hold, it might be a good time to remind ourselves what the existing system allows. Currently MPs are allowed to take on a second role, as long as they are not a government minister. They must publicly declare any additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%. Those who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving. They are banned from lobbying the government for two years as well. In addition, all MPs are ""strictly forbidden"" from being paid for ""advocating a particular matter"" in Parliament. Read more here. Conservative MP Danny Kruger says former colleague Owen Paterson - who has quit Parliament after being found to have broken rules on lobbying - is his friend. He adds that Paterson has done ""good service to the state"" - but does not defend his actions on behalf of two companies that prompted the current row over second jobs. Reality Check At PMQs earlier, Boris Johnson repeatedly
referred to Sir Keir Starmerâs earnings as a lawyer and, in particular, money
heâd been paid by law firm Mishcon de Reya since he was elected to Parliament
in 2015. Starmer's entries in the MPs' register of interests show he
was paid Â£7,060 by Mishcon de Reya for legal advice in December 2015, and Â£4,500 per month between June and September in 2016 for legal advice to
the Mishcon de Reya Academy, which provides training. In total, Sir Keir has earned over Â£100,000 from his legal
work since becoming an MP, although none since he became Labour leader last year. Some of the payments he has received have come from
sources that are not named in the register. Starmer says the sources of
those payments werenât named to protect client confidentiality. The Labour leader says he gave up his practising
certificate nearly two years ago, so he is no longer able to give legal advice. After PMQs and a marathon questioning by senior MPs, Boris Johnson might have been hoping the day's parliamentary wrangling was over. But debate over a Labour party motion on second jobs has been well under way for a couple of hours now. The opposition day motion on standards in public life was called after Labour unveiled its plans to ban extra jobs for MPs - unless they are public service roles - on Tuesday. But as the party announced the proposals, the prime minister revealed his own, echoing Labour's call - but one which the opposition described as merely a ""watered down"" version of their plan from the government. Following the debate MPs will vote on the two plans, expected at around 19:00. Read more about what is happening in Westminster tonight here. Meanwhile, back in the Commons, MPs continue to debate proposed changes to rules surrounding their ability to work second jobs. Tory MP Mark Fletcher says recent headlines about MPs' second jobs ""simply reinforce"" what the public feels about politicians. But he argues this is unfair and urges Labour and other opposition parties to ""dial down the mud-slinging"" against Conservatives. You can read more on the current rules for MPs' second jobshere. This video can not be played Chris Bryant challenges Johnson over MPs' standards That was lengthy session of the Liaison Committee. Here are some of the highlights: The questioning of Boris Johnson has now ended, with chair Bernard Jenkin thanking the prime minister for his time and generosity in attending the Liaison Committee for the third and final time this year. Johnson indignantly points out this is in fact the fourth time he has been grilled by the committee chairs, after a session was delayed from last year. The PM adds he will see them in 2022 - a prospect he is no doubt relishing! Thanks for sticking with us, we'll have a summary of the afternoon's events with you shortly. Jeremy Hunt, who is also a former health secretary, then asks about efforts to fill a vacancies in the NHS, which he says now stands at 93,000. He asks whether the government will back a proposal to introduce independent estimates every year for the number of doctors that need to be recruited. Boris Johnson says he is ""happy to study"" the idea, but the government has its own targets. He admits there are shortages in ""many key areas"". Richard Ratcliffe, husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, recently spent 21 days on a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office Last but not least is Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee. The former foreign secretary asks about thecase of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He says Iran has linked her release to the UK's repayment of a historic debt - and asks whether only the UK will decide on this. Boris Johnson says in an ""ideal world"" the UK would be able to resolve the issue by repaying the debt, but things are more ""complicated"" than that. He adds that he continues to be ""horrified"" by how she has been treated and the government is working ""as hard as we can"" to secure her release. He adds that it ""breaks his heart"" that he cannot guarantee, however, she will be home for Christmas. ""Are you responsible for empty shelves in Supermarkets,"" asks MacNeil. The PM says he is responsible for ""trying to help improve supply chains"". He says the problem is caused by global factors such as a shortage of HGV drivers. Has Brexit made it worse, asks the SNP MP. ""It is a pan-European problem,"" the PM replies adding that working conditions for HGV drivers should be improved. Committee chair Bernard Jenkin jokes that he could renew his HGV licence if it would help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A Covid vaccine passport QR code for domestic use in Northern Ireland can be downloaded through the COVIDCert NI app Northern Ireland ministers have voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports to be introduced from next month. Under the measure, people have to provide a passport or proof of a Covid test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants. DUP ministers voted against the proposal but Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP, Alliance and UUP ministers backed it. Speaking after the vote, Health Minister Robin Swann said ministers ""have to act"". He said that the a Covid passport was not the only option for people wanting to enter hospitality premises under the scheme - people could also use a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days. Robin Swann's proposal was backed by Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance Mr Swann's plan would mean the regulations would take effect from 29 November but won't be legally enforced until 13 December, as there would be a 14-day grace period before fixed penalty notices could be issued. It is understood the measure would apply for access to: nightclubs hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with 500 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated events where more than 10,000 people will be present regardless of whether they are seated Mr Swann said: ""There's the three options there - it's not solely vaccination."" He added: ""Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. ""We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Paul Givan says DUP ministers voted against Covid passports But DUP First Minister Paul Givan said that this regulation should be put to a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it takes effect. He added: ""Whenever we ask questions around the economic impact assessment, none has been carried out. ""No equality impact assessment; no assessment in terms of human rights legislation and yet, other executive ministers felt they could support a policy that had flaws within that paper, even on the scientific evidence."" Reaction to Stormont vote for Covid passports DUP members have been outspoken in their opposition to the proposals. The party's Paul Frew tweeted his vehement opposition to the mandatory Covid status plan. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said it was a ""bad decision"" made in haste, which would cost the hospitality industry money it could not afford. However, SDLP minister Nichola Mallon challenged the DUP's decision to vote against the proposal, saying that ""the last thing people want is another Christmas apart from each other"". ""We need to use every tool in our toolboxâ¦ serious questions need to be asked of the DUP as to why they voted against it,"" she said.

Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the executive's decision, and the lack of financial support, sent a signal that the hospitality industry is ""of no value or concern"". ""Evidence shows that this will negatively impact footfall and increase costs in the most important part of the year,"" he said. ""As the worst impacted industry, and the one singled out repeatedly for restrictions, we are facing an unknown future. Our industry will have to fight to retain staff and save businesses."" People who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland can obtain certification by downloading the COVIDCert NI app. It was released in July for use by people travelling abroad but was recently updated to allow users to hold a separate certificate for domestic use. People who have already downloaded their certification for international travel will be given an option to activate their domestic certificate. That domestic certificate - in the form of a QR code - will scanned by venue staff using the separate COVIDCert Check NI app. If the QR code is verified, the display will show a green screen containing a tick. If the QR code is not verified, the display will show a red screen containing a cross. Both apps can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The health department had warned that tougher Covid-19 restrictions could be required before Christmas even if proof of Covid status comes into force in Northern Ireland. In its briefing paper for ministers, the department says evidence suggests that adherence to guidelines by the public is declining and that ""Covid certification on a voluntary basis by the hospitality sector"" has had low uptake. It adds: ""We strongly advise that further immediate measures are required to increase adherence to continued mitigations, including use of face coverings, work from home, outdoor meetings, ventilation and limiting contacts."" ""It is unlikely that this will be sufficient to reduce the R number (Rt) to less than 1 unless there is also widespread use of Covid certification across higher risk settings."" The paper says that in the past week the number of new positive cases has risen by 23% in Northern Ireland, hospital admissions have risen 19%, hospital occupancy is up 10% and the percentage of positive tests has also increased. It added that although intensive care units occupancy and deaths have declined, those are described as ""lagging indicators in the context of increasing community transmission"". The SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon proposed the use of mandatory passports in September High-level discussions about introducing mandatory Covid passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland have been taking place since late summer. At that stage, few of the political parties supported the idea. In September, the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Ms Mallon proposed the move to other executive colleagues. It was voted down at that stage, with ministers instead opting toput in advice around vaccine certification mitigationsbut this was not legally enforceable. Ms Mallon and the Alliance Party's Justice Minister Naomi Long both said they wanted to see compulsory vaccine passports being introduced ahead of the nightclub sector reopening in Northern Ireland on 31 October, when social distancing rules were also scrapped in hospitality venues. In mid-October, Stormont ministers published a contingency plan which referred tothe ""potential"" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in ""higher risk settings""but said it would require agreement from the executive. On 1 November, the Department of Healthreleased the COVIDCert Check NI app to allow businesses to scan vaccine certificates ""voluntary use"" of vaccine checksin hospitality and entertainment venues.

""It is unlikely that this will be sufficient to reduce the R number (Rt) to less than 1 unless there is also widespread use of Covid certification across higher risk settings."" The paper says that in the past week the number of new positive cases has risen by 23% in Northern Ireland, hospital admissions have risen 19%, hospital occupancy is up 10% and the percentage of positive tests has also increased. It added that although intensive care units occupancy and deaths have declined, those are described as ""lagging indicators in the context of increasing community transmission"". The SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon proposed the use of mandatory passports in September High-level discussions about introducing mandatory Covid passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland have been taking place since late summer. At that stage, few of the political parties supported the idea. In September, the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Ms Mallon proposed the move to other executive colleagues. It was voted down at that stage, with ministers instead opting toput in advice around vaccine certification mitigationsbut this was not legally enforceable. Ms Mallon and the Alliance Party's Justice Minister Naomi Long both said they wanted to see compulsory vaccine passports being introduced ahead of the nightclub sector reopening in Northern Ireland on 31 October, when social distancing rules were also scrapped in hospitality venues. In mid-October, Stormont ministers published a contingency plan which referred tothe ""potential"" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in ""higher risk settings""but said it would require agreement from the executive. On 1 November, the Department of Healthreleased the COVIDCert Check NI app to allow businesses to scan vaccine certificates ""voluntary use"" of vaccine checksin hospitality and entertainment venues.

"As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel describes the situation as ""dramatic"" Some 22,479 Covid cases were recorded in the Czech Republic yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began It comes as cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36,626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week Covid restrictions had a ""catastrophic effect"" on the arts, culture and heritage sectors, a University of Sheffield report says Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks last year UK health officials warn of a ""hidden pandemic"" of antibiotic-resistant infections if people fail to act responsibly after Covid Spectators will be allowed to go to New Year's Eve celebrations in New York's Times Square, after it was cancelled last year Edited by Emma Harrison Today's reporting was brought to you by Joseph Lee, Jen Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, George Wright, Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin, Suzanne Leigh and Tiffany Wertheimer We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly. The Airport Operators Association said while European airports were working at 60% or 70% of capacity over summer, in the UK they ""struggled to get above the low double digit percentages"". If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main headlines so far today: As we've been hearing, much of Europe is facing a surge in cases and this has been blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. So what is the vaccination rate across Europe? Well, this varies. The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections. Daily infectionsrose to 14,416on Wednesday, official data
showed, the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. It comes three days into a controversial lockdown
for those not fully vaccinated aimed at halting the surge. About two million
people are not fully vaccinated and can now only leave their homes for a
limited number of reasons including going to work, shopping for essentials and
""stretching your legs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.08658823
"The cost of living has surged at its fastest pace in almost 10 years, hitting 4.2% in the year to October. It is mainly due to higher fuel and energy prices but the cost of second-hand cars and eating out also rose,the Office for National Statistics said,external. Inflation is up sharply since Covid restrictions ended this year and the economy reopened. The Bank of England says it may have to raise interest rates in the ""coming months"" to tackle rising prices. October's reading is far higher than the 3.1% rise recorded in the year to September and more than double the Bank's target of 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car cleaned. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money - sometimes referred to as the cost of living. Household energy bills were the biggest driver of inflation after Ofgem, the energy regulator, lifted the price cap on domestic gas and electricity last month. It meant that gas bills rose by 28.1% in the year to October, while electricity climbed by 18.8%. Petrol prices also rose by 25.4p to 138.6p per litre amid a surge in global oil prices. That's the highest price since September 2012. Fuel prices have surged recently Used car prices also rose by 27.4% since April this year, due to a global microchip shortage which has slowed the production of new vehicles. Hotel stays, transport, clothing, household goods and raw materials also became more expensive. There are a number of reasons: Demand for oil and gas is pushing up energy prices worldwide. This means higher bills for householders and for businesses, many of whom will pass on some or all of the extra energy costs to their customers Shortages of many goods, including building materials and computer chips, are causing supply problems and pushing up prices Government support to businesses during the pandemic - like reduced VAT for hospitality - has ended Businesses are struggling to recruit lorry drivers and hospitality staff, and so are having to put up wages (costs that get passed on to consumers). This is partly due to the pandemic, but is also compounded by Brexit,according to international policy forum the OECD. Read more here Paula Sharp and Sarah Allan Paula Sharp and Sarah Allan, nursery workers from Halifax in Yorkshire, have increased the hours they work because of their rising household costs. ""I'm getting more money in, but I'm paying it out on fuel, food, clothes,"" said Paula. Both women have seen a steep rise in their gas and electricity bills, and say they have to spend time shopping around to find the best deals on goods. ""We are tending to go for offers in the supermarket. The kids can't just put what they want in the trolley,"" says Sarah, who has 12 year-old twins. ""Everything has gone up. It might only be 50p or 60p here or there, but it does add up."" Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Andrew Baileyapologised for the rising pricesand warned inflation could climb as high as 5%, before falling back again.

""The Bank and other forecasters expect it to rise right the way through to April, and then to stay well above target for the rest of the year,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""So this isn't really a blip, this is quite a marked trend."" Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Many countries are experiencing higher inflation as we recover from Covid, and we know people are facing pressures with the cost of living."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak says many countries face high inflation But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said households would be more than Â£1,000 worse off a year due to the price rises. ""Instead of taking action, the government are looking the other way, blaming 'global problems' while they trap us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" she said. Yes, many are facing similar problems as their economies reopen, such as surging energy prices and supply chain issues. US consumer pricesrose by 6.2% in the year to October,the fastest rate for three decades. Inflation across the Eurozone was 4.1% in October, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. And Canada's inflation rate hit the same level in September, marking an 18-year high. Most analysts now expect the Bank of England to increase interest rates from their current historic lows at its next meeting in December. A low interest rate means it is cheaper for people and businesses to borrow money, which they then spend or invest which in turn fuels economic growth. While growth is encouraged  - especially following the various lockdowns - surging inflation could spell trouble for households. If the Bank of England lifts the interest rate, High Street banks may put up the borrowing costs they charge individuals and businesses. Higher interest rates mean people receive a better return on their savings, which should encourage them to save rather than spend. The theory is that if more people to save, this should slow the increase in prices of everyday goods by tempering demand. However, some analysts say a rate rise may not be effective in this case, because many of the factors driving UK inflation are global, such as higher oil prices. Read more For any member of a household paying an energy bill, it's obvious why the sharply rising prices are concerning. And of course, for poor households, especially pensioners, it will hit them hard financially. But at least from an environmental point of view, there may be an upside. Cheaper bills can carry hidden costs because they do too little to discourage us from wastefully emitting greenhouse gases. The effects of that may not be visible to us but they're not invisible if, for example, you live in a Pacific island nation. Where we don't need to burn energy and do so, for example, because we prefer the house to be at 21C rather than a perfectly habitable 16C, higher energy costs will make us think twice. That could do more to encourage us to invest in insulation, curb unnecessary emissions and to mindful of what we are doing to the planet than any resolution at last week's COP26 conference in Glasgow.

"The flat was in Old Fishmarket Close, near to Edinburgh city centre Students in Edinburgh have lost thousands of pounds falling for a scam which preys on the huge demand for rented accommodation in the city. During our investigation we met Tony who helped carry out the scam and did not even know he was doing it. He had just moved to Scotland with his pregnant wife and child and was looking for work. Trawling through job adverts online, the 40-year-old found one for a viewing agent in Edinburgh's frantic rental market. Within days, Tony was on a trial shift for a boss he had never met, showing potential tenants around an immaculate but affordable flat next to the Royal Mile. However, what he didn't know was that his new boss didn't exist, the property was owned by someone else and he was playing an unwitting role in a scam fleecing students out of thousands. BBC Scotland is giving full details of the scam so people can avoid falling prey to similar cons. Hamish Drain had been looking for a flat in the city for months On Saturday 2 October, Hamish Drain and his friend Erik were invited to a 21:00 viewing at a flat in Old Fishmarket Close. Hamish, a mechanical engineering student at Heriot-Watt University, had been looking for a flat in the city since August. The 21-year-old toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat his friend had spotted this property on Facebook Marketplace, where flats for rent in the city are advertised. The advert told them they would pay Â£950 per month for rent and bills. It was an attractive price in a city where average rent alone for two-bedroom flats is Â£1,041. Hamish had arranged the viewing with the flat's apparent landlord, who called himself ""William Wilson"". ""He sent us a landlord registration number, a limited company - all the things that made us think it was a legitimate property,"" Hamish said. After being shown around the flat by Tony, Hamish and his friend paid Â£2,300 to Wilson by bank transfer to secure it. But when the landlord stopped replying to his emails, he realised he'd been duped. ""It did seem too good to be true,"" Hamish said. ""We were really quite angry about it because it was a lot of money for us. A fair chunk of our savings each, so it was quite upsetting."" The fake passport used by William Wilson (redactions by BBC) The fraudster was able to take advantage of Edinburgh's abundance of short-term lets made available via online booking platforms. In 2019, one in eight homes in the city centre were listed on Airbnb, according to the Scottish government. The flat used in this scam is owned by a private company providing accommodation for tourists. Photos of the furnished property are used in online advertising. It was these photos that the scammer calling himself Wilson harvested before reposting them with his own advert on Facebook Marketplace. He lured potential tenants with low prices and promises of a home ""at the heart of the Royal Mile within a short walk from all local amenities"". To make it more convincing, he sent those rushing to secure the property a list of documents, including Registers of Scotland paperwork and a fake passport for a William Wilson. But the ownership papers and bank statements didn't match. His landlord number was linked to a different business in Orkney. The passport was also suspect - its unique number wasn't visible and it had what looked like an electronic signature. However, those who fell for his trick didn't notice until it was too late. In some variations of this scam, a fraudster may ask for money upfront before a viewing. Some unsuspecting customers may send money only to find out later they had been scammed. However, in this case, Wilson played it differently. He gained access to the property on 2 and 3 October - BBC Scotland could not confirm whether he legitimately booked the property - before casting his net for someone looking for quick work. Photos of the furnished property are used in online advertising After responding to the job ad, Tony was to meet Wilson's assistant ""Abigail"" at the flat to pick up the keys and start his trial shift. He told BBC Scotland there was a lot of ""back and forth"" by text. He said: ""We didn't speak on the phone which was quite unusual, but I thought maybe this is just how things are now with the gig economy - you turn up, you do the job. ""There was no reason to think anything was dodgy at that point."" Before he arrived, however, Tony received a text from Wilson telling him Abigail wasn't going to make it. Instead, he was left with a code for a lock box where he found the keys to the flat. He said: ""I texted all the people who were going to come and view the place. I started doing the viewings and it was all pretty straightforward, showing them round this nice two-bedroom flat near the Royal Mile. It was a very easy sell. ""A lot of the people who were viewing were very keen on the property. I would say over 50% were students. They were all very interested because it was just a nice flat and it was a very good price as well."" After 11 viewings on the Saturday, Tony was paid Â£75 and invited back for a second shift on Sunday. Ten more people turned up. He added: ""I was quite enjoying the job, meeting these people and showing them around."" The two-bedroom flat was just of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile Mary - who asked to use a pseudonym - is from the United States and is a recent business graduate at Heriot-Watt University. She viewed the flat on the Sunday afternoon in the hope of moving in with her undergraduate friend, who is currently studying at the same university remotely from England. ""Everything looked really nice,"" the 22-year-old said. ""It was in great shape and very modern as well. And for the price it was being offered for, for us, we thought it was quite a steal."" She quickly paid Wilson the Â£2,300 to secure the property and signed a tenancy agreement but admitted skimming over the finer details in the documents. ""Back then, we had no right to believe it was remotely a scam, or anything that could resemble one, because we saw the flat, we were in contact with the person who showed us the flat,"" she said. ""Everything looked legit, until all of a sudden it wasn't."" Wilson went quiet for days after receiving the cash and stopped responding to emails. Mary and her friend soon discovered the inconsistencies in the paperwork and understood they had been scammed. She said: ""I don't have the most amount of money in my account. And the money that I did have, I got from working really hard as a waitress over the summer before my graduate job started. ""For me, it felt like a bit of an attack on my progress so far, and also my choice to be in this country. ""I've spent so much time and energy to try and stay here and it kind of felt like someone was telling me not to stay here for whatever reason."" Tony received thanks for helping people secure the flat In the days after his shifts, Tony received a message of thanks from someone who thought they'd secured the property. ""The person who contacted me was staying in a hotel because they had nowhere to live basically,"" he said. ""So I was quite pleased they got the place."" Then a few days later he got a text from someone else who'd viewed the property saying they had also been offered a contract for the place. ""I thought that was a bit strange but that maybe the other one fell through,"" Tony said. ""And then, a few days after that, someone else called me and said they had some questions and said that things didn't quite add up. ""That was when the alarm bells started to ring."" After failing to reach Wilson, Tony realised that he'd been an unwitting participant in a fraud. He was in a tricky situation. He said: ""On one side, this criminal has my information, and then on the other side, all these people who viewed would think I'm potentially a criminal as well. ""I felt sick for a while. I had basically shown all these people around and I'd been complicit in a scam without realising it. ""I'd build rapport with these people and I was all very friendly and nice with them and some of them lost thousands. It was over two grand for the deposit and the month's rent. ""I felt like I'd sleepwalked into this. I just saw the advert, he'd lured me in with the promise of more work and I helped him rip off all these people."" Hamish, Tony and Mary have all reported the incident to the police. BBC Scotland has attempted to contact the real owners of the short-term let in Old Fishmarket Close for comment. We were unable to reach the owner of the landlord registration number. There is no suggestion either had any involvement in Wilson's scheme. Edinburgh has experienced a growth in short term lets but also has shortage of affordable housing Edinburgh has a set of conditions that allowed a scam like Wilson's to work so effectively. While it has experienced a growth in short-term lets, it also has a shortage of affordable housing. Rents have risen faster there than in any other part of Scotland - a one-bedroom flat in the city now averages at Â£799 a month. The City of Edinburgh Council is gathering evidence to introduce a rent pressure zone in the city centre. It is also consulting on new planning rules for short-term lets but Scotland-wide legislation has been delayed. Campaigners say the high rental prices mean students looking to live in the city while studying are ""vulnerable to scams, profiteering landlords and unsafe accommodation"". Matt Crilly, president of NUS Scotland, called on the Scottish government to introduce a new strategy for student housing. He said: ""The current housing crisis in parts of Scotland has left many students homeless with students pushed to look on unregulated websites for accommodation and others staying in hostels and sofa-surfing just to access their education. ""With new students due to arrive at many universities in January, there is a risk the crisis will be exacerbated. We urgently need the Scottish government to deliver on their promise of a student housing strategy for Scotland and ensure every student has access to safe, affordable housing."" Thomas managed to spot Wilson's scheme before he handed over any money While Hamish managed to get his money back from his bank, Mary is so far still out of pocket. Meanwhile, law student Thomas Rofe managed to spot Wilson's scheme before he handed over any money. But just a week later, he was scammed out of Â£450 after a fake landlord asked for money upfront to view another property. His mum sent the money but no viewing was ever arranged. The 23-year-old is now renting a small two-bedroom tenement flat in Marchmont, where the kitchen is in the living room. It costs Thomas and his flatmate Â£1,350 a month. ""The more and more you look into, the more you hear of people falling victim to these things recently,"" he said. ""It does seem that people have noticed there is a real struggle for property, not just in Edinburgh but all over Scotland, and there are people who are willing to take advantage of that to gain as much money as they can."" Meta, the company that runs Facebook, said it was sorry to hear that Hamish was misled and that it encouraged people to report sophisticated scams to the police. A spokeswoman said: ""We've dedicated significant resources to tackle the industry-wide issue of online scams by working to detect and remove scam ads and fraudulent behaviour. ""We continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people, and have donated Â£3m to Citizens Advice to deliver a UK Scam Action Programme which raises awareness of online scams and helps victims."" A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed that an investigation was under way after officers received reports of potentially fraudulent activity involving flats on Old Fishmarket Close and elsewhere in Edinburgh. He said: ""Police Scotland is acutely aware that criminals will take any opportunity to exploit any situation for their own gain. We would ask the public to continue to be mindful and to call 101 if they have any concerns that you may be the victim of a scam."" The spokesman said advice was available on its website,external.

"A Covid vaccine passport QR code for domestic use in Northern Ireland can be downloaded through the COVIDCert NI app Northern Ireland ministers have voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports to be introduced from next month. Under the measure, people have to provide a passport or proof of a Covid test result to access nightclubs, pubs or restaurants. DUP ministers voted against the proposal but Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP, Alliance and UUP ministers backed it. Speaking after the vote, Health Minister Robin Swann said ministers ""have to act"". He said that the a Covid passport was not the only option for people wanting to enter hospitality premises under the scheme - people could also use a negative lateral flow test taken in the previous 48 hours or proof of a positive PCR test taken in the previous 30 to 180 days. Robin Swann's proposal was backed by Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance Mr Swann's plan would mean the regulations would take effect from 29 November but won't be legally enforced until 13 December, as there would be a 14-day grace period before fixed penalty notices could be issued. It is understood the measure would apply for access to: nightclubs hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with 500 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated events where more than 10,000 people will be present regardless of whether they are seated Mr Swann said: ""There's the three options there - it's not solely vaccination."" He added: ""Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. ""We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter."" This video can not be played Covid-19: Paul Givan says DUP ministers voted against Covid passports But DUP First Minister Paul Givan said that this regulation should be put to a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly before it takes effect. He added: ""Whenever we ask questions around the economic impact assessment, none has been carried out. ""No equality impact assessment; no assessment in terms of human rights legislation and yet, other executive ministers felt they could support a policy that had flaws within that paper, even on the scientific evidence."" Reaction to Stormont vote for Covid passports DUP members have been outspoken in their opposition to the proposals. The party's Paul Frew tweeted his vehement opposition to the mandatory Covid status plan. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said it was a ""bad decision"" made in haste, which would cost the hospitality industry money it could not afford. However, SDLP minister Nichola Mallon challenged the DUP's decision to vote against the proposal, saying that ""the last thing people want is another Christmas apart from each other"". ""We need to use every tool in our toolboxâ¦ serious questions need to be asked of the DUP as to why they voted against it,"" she said. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Virus transmission is going in the wrong direction' Sinn FÃ©in Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the Department of Health would now work on drafting a second paper that would look at other measures that can be introduced to manage the spread of Covid-19. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the executive's decision, and the lack of financial support, sent a signal that the hospitality industry is ""of no value or concern"". ""Evidence shows that this will negatively impact footfall and increase costs in the most important part of the year,"" he said. ""As the worst impacted industry, and the one singled out repeatedly for restrictions, we are facing an unknown future. Our industry will have to fight to retain staff and save businesses."" People who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland can obtain certification by downloading the COVIDCert NI app. It was released in July for use by people travelling abroad but was recently updated to allow users to hold a separate certificate for domestic use. People who have already downloaded their certification for international travel will be given an option to activate their domestic certificate. That domestic certificate - in the form of a QR code - will scanned by venue staff using the separate COVIDCert Check NI app. If the QR code is verified, the display will show a green screen containing a tick. If the QR code is not verified, the display will show a red screen containing a cross. Both apps can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The health department had warned that tougher Covid-19 restrictions could be required before Christmas even if proof of Covid status comes into force in Northern Ireland. In its briefing paper for ministers, the department says evidence suggests that adherence to guidelines by the public is declining and that ""Covid certification on a voluntary basis by the hospitality sector"" has had low uptake. It adds: ""We strongly advise that further immediate measures are required to increase adherence to continued mitigations, including use of face coverings, work from home, outdoor meetings, ventilation and limiting contacts."" ""It is unlikely that this will be sufficient to reduce the R number (Rt) to less than 1 unless there is also widespread use of Covid certification across higher risk settings."" The paper says that in the past week the number of new positive cases has risen by 23% in Northern Ireland, hospital admissions have risen 19%, hospital occupancy is up 10% and the percentage of positive tests has also increased. It added that although intensive care units occupancy and deaths have declined, those are described as ""lagging indicators in the context of increasing community transmission"". The SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon proposed the use of mandatory passports in September High-level discussions about introducing mandatory Covid passports for domestic use in Northern Ireland have been taking place since late summer. At that stage, few of the political parties supported the idea. In September, the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Ms Mallon proposed the move to other executive colleagues. It was voted down at that stage, with ministers instead opting toput in advice around vaccine certification mitigationsbut this was not legally enforceable. Ms Mallon and the Alliance Party's Justice Minister Naomi Long both said they wanted to see compulsory vaccine passports being introduced ahead of the nightclub sector reopening in Northern Ireland on 31 October, when social distancing rules were also scrapped in hospitality venues. In mid-October, Stormont ministers published a contingency plan which referred tothe ""potential"" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in ""higher risk settings""but said it would require agreement from the executive. On 1 November, the Department of Healthreleased the COVIDCert Check NI app to allow businesses to scan vaccine certificates ""voluntary use"" of vaccine checksin hospitality and entertainment venues.

"The cost of living has surged at its fastest pace in almost 10 years, hitting 4.2% in the year to October. It is mainly due to higher fuel and energy prices but the cost of second-hand cars and eating out also rose,the Office for National Statistics said,external. Inflation is up sharply since Covid restrictions ended this year and the economy reopened. The Bank of England says it may have to raise interest rates in the ""coming months"" to tackle rising prices. October's reading is far higher than the 3.1% rise recorded in the year to September and more than double the Bank's target of 2%. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car cleaned. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money - sometimes referred to as the cost of living. Household energy bills were the biggest driver of inflation after Ofgem, the energy regulator, lifted the price cap on domestic gas and electricity last month. It meant that gas bills rose by 28.1% in the year to October, while electricity climbed by 18.8%. Petrol prices also rose by 25.4p to 138.6p per litre amid a surge in global oil prices. That's the highest price since September 2012. Fuel prices have surged recently Used car prices also rose by 27.4% since April this year, due to a global microchip shortage which has slowed the production of new vehicles. Hotel stays, transport, clothing, household goods and raw materials also became more expensive. There are a number of reasons: Demand for oil and gas is pushing up energy prices worldwide. This means higher bills for householders and for businesses, many of whom will pass on some or all of the extra energy costs to their customers Shortages of many goods, including building materials and computer chips, are causing supply problems and pushing up prices Government support to businesses during the pandemic - like reduced VAT for hospitality - has ended Businesses are struggling to recruit lorry drivers and hospitality staff, and so are having to put up wages (costs that get passed on to consumers). This is partly due to the pandemic, but is also compounded by Brexit,according to international policy forum the OECD. Read more here Paula Sharp and Sarah Allan Paula Sharp and Sarah Allan, nursery workers from Halifax in Yorkshire, have increased the hours they work because of their rising household costs. ""I'm getting more money in, but I'm paying it out on fuel, food, clothes,"" said Paula. Both women have seen a steep rise in their gas and electricity bills, and say they have to spend time shopping around to find the best deals on goods. ""We are tending to go for offers in the supermarket. The kids can't just put what they want in the trolley,"" says Sarah, who has 12 year-old twins. ""Everything has gone up. It might only be 50p or 60p here or there, but it does add up."" Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Andrew Baileyapologised for the rising pricesand warned inflation could climb as high as 5%, before falling back again. How have you adapted to rising prices? Are you shopping or living your life differently as a result? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Sir John Gieve, a former member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates, said that October's high inflation figures were not ""a one-off"". ""The Bank and other forecasters expect it to rise right the way through to April, and then to stay well above target for the rest of the year,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""So this isn't really a blip, this is quite a marked trend."" Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Many countries are experiencing higher inflation as we recover from Covid, and we know people are facing pressures with the cost of living."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak says many countries face high inflation But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said households would be more than Â£1,000 worse off a year due to the price rises. ""Instead of taking action, the government are looking the other way, blaming 'global problems' while they trap us in a high tax, low growth cycle,"" she said. Yes, many are facing similar problems as their economies reopen, such as surging energy prices and supply chain issues. US consumer pricesrose by 6.2% in the year to October,the fastest rate for three decades. Inflation across the Eurozone was 4.1% in October, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. And Canada's inflation rate hit the same level in September, marking an 18-year high. Most analysts now expect the Bank of England to increase interest rates from their current historic lows at its next meeting in December. A low interest rate means it is cheaper for people and businesses to borrow money, which they then spend or invest which in turn fuels economic growth. While growth is encouraged  - especially following the various lockdowns - surging inflation could spell trouble for households. If the Bank of England lifts the interest rate, High Street banks may put up the borrowing costs they charge individuals and businesses. Higher interest rates mean people receive a better return on their savings, which should encourage them to save rather than spend. The theory is that if more people to save, this should slow the increase in prices of everyday goods by tempering demand. However, some analysts say a rate rise may not be effective in this case, because many of the factors driving UK inflation are global, such as higher oil prices. Read more For any member of a household paying an energy bill, it's obvious why the sharply rising prices are concerning. And of course, for poor households, especially pensioners, it will hit them hard financially. But at least from an environmental point of view, there may be an upside. Cheaper bills can carry hidden costs because they do too little to discourage us from wastefully emitting greenhouse gases. The effects of that may not be visible to us but they're not invisible if, for example, you live in a Pacific island nation. Where we don't need to burn energy and do so, for example, because we prefer the house to be at 21C rather than a perfectly habitable 16C, higher energy costs will make us think twice. That could do more to encourage us to invest in insulation, curb unnecessary emissions and to mindful of what we are doing to the planet than any resolution at last week's COP26 conference in Glasgow.

"The flat was in Old Fishmarket Close, near to Edinburgh city centre Students in Edinburgh have lost thousands of pounds falling for a scam which preys on the huge demand for rented accommodation in the city. During our investigation we met Tony who helped carry out the scam and did not even know he was doing it. He had just moved to Scotland with his pregnant wife and child and was looking for work. Trawling through job adverts online, the 40-year-old found one for a viewing agent in Edinburgh's frantic rental market. Within days, Tony was on a trial shift for a boss he had never met, showing potential tenants around an immaculate but affordable flat next to the Royal Mile. However, what he didn't know was that his new boss didn't exist, the property was owned by someone else and he was playing an unwitting role in a scam fleecing students out of thousands. BBC Scotland is giving full details of the scam so people can avoid falling prey to similar cons. Hamish Drain had been looking for a flat in the city for months On Saturday 2 October, Hamish Drain and his friend Erik were invited to a 21:00 viewing at a flat in Old Fishmarket Close. Hamish, a mechanical engineering student at Heriot-Watt University, had been looking for a flat in the city since August. The 21-year-old toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat his friend had spotted this property on Facebook Marketplace, where flats for rent in the city are advertised. The advert told them they would pay Â£950 per month for rent and bills. It was an attractive price in a city where average rent alone for two-bedroom flats is Â£1,041. Hamish had arranged the viewing with the flat's apparent landlord, who called himself ""William Wilson"". ""He sent us a landlord registration number, a limited company - all the things that made us think it was a legitimate property,"" Hamish said. After being shown around the flat by Tony, Hamish and his friend paid Â£2,300 to Wilson by bank transfer to secure it. But when the landlord stopped replying to his emails, he realised he'd been duped. ""It did seem too good to be true,"" Hamish said. ""We were really quite angry about it because it was a lot of money for us. A fair chunk of our savings each, so it was quite upsetting."" The fake passport used by William Wilson (redactions by BBC) The fraudster was able to take advantage of Edinburgh's abundance of short-term lets made available via online booking platforms. In 2019, one in eight homes in the city centre were listed on Airbnb, according to the Scottish government. The flat used in this scam is owned by a private company providing accommodation for tourists. Photos of the furnished property are used in online advertising. It was these photos that the scammer calling himself Wilson harvested before reposting them with his own advert on Facebook Marketplace. He lured potential tenants with low prices and promises of a home ""at the heart of the Royal Mile within a short walk from all local amenities"". To make it more convincing, he sent those rushing to secure the property a list of documents, including Registers of Scotland paperwork and a fake passport for a William Wilson. But the ownership papers and bank statements didn't match. His landlord number was linked to a different business in Orkney. The passport was also suspect - its unique number wasn't visible and it had what looked like an electronic signature. However, those who fell for his trick didn't notice until it was too late. In some variations of this scam, a fraudster may ask for money upfront before a viewing. Some unsuspecting customers may send money only to find out later they had been scammed. However, in this case, Wilson played it differently. He gained access to the property on 2 and 3 October - BBC Scotland could not confirm whether he legitimately booked the property - before casting his net for someone looking for quick work. Photos of the furnished property are used in online advertising After responding to the job ad, Tony was to meet Wilson's assistant ""Abigail"" at the flat to pick up the keys and start his trial shift. He told BBC Scotland there was a lot of ""back and forth"" by text. He said: ""We didn't speak on the phone which was quite unusual, but I thought maybe this is just how things are now with the gig economy - you turn up, you do the job. ""There was no reason to think anything was dodgy at that point."" Before he arrived, however, Tony received a text from Wilson telling him Abigail wasn't going to make it. Instead, he was left with a code for a lock box where he found the keys to the flat. He said: ""I texted all the people who were going to come and view the place. I started doing the viewings and it was all pretty straightforward, showing them round this nice two-bedroom flat near the Royal Mile. It was a very easy sell. ""A lot of the people who were viewing were very keen on the property. I would say over 50% were students. They were all very interested because it was just a nice flat and it was a very good price as well."" After 11 viewings on the Saturday, Tony was paid Â£75 and invited back for a second shift on Sunday. Ten more people turned up. He added: ""I was quite enjoying the job, meeting these people and showing them around."" The two-bedroom flat was just of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile Mary - who asked to use a pseudonym - is from the United States and is a recent business graduate at Heriot-Watt University. She viewed the flat on the Sunday afternoon in the hope of moving in with her undergraduate friend, who is currently studying at the same university remotely from England. ""Everything looked really nice,"" the 22-year-old said. ""It was in great shape and very modern as well. And for the price it was being offered for, for us, we thought it was quite a steal."" She quickly paid Wilson the Â£2,300 to secure the property and signed a tenancy agreement but admitted skimming over the finer details in the documents. ""Back then, we had no right to believe it was remotely a scam, or anything that could resemble one, because we saw the flat, we were in contact with the person who showed us the flat,"" she said. ""Everything looked legit, until all of a sudden it wasn't."" Wilson went quiet for days after receiving the cash and stopped responding to emails. Mary and her friend soon discovered the inconsistencies in the paperwork and understood they had been scammed. She said: ""I don't have the most amount of money in my account. And the money that I did have, I got from working really hard as a waitress over the summer before my graduate job started. ""For me, it felt like a bit of an attack on my progress so far, and also my choice to be in this country. ""I've spent so much time and energy to try and stay here and it kind of felt like someone was telling me not to stay here for whatever reason."" Tony received thanks for helping people secure the flat In the days after his shifts, Tony received a message of thanks from someone who thought they'd secured the property. ""The person who contacted me was staying in a hotel because they had nowhere to live basically,"" he said. ""So I was quite pleased they got the place."" Then a few days later he got a text from someone else who'd viewed the property saying they had also been offered a contract for the place. ""I thought that was a bit strange but that maybe the other one fell through,"" Tony said. ""And then, a few days after that, someone else called me and said they had some questions and said that things didn't quite add up. ""That was when the alarm bells started to ring."" After failing to reach Wilson, Tony realised that he'd been an unwitting participant in a fraud. He was in a tricky situation. He said: ""On one side, this criminal has my information, and then on the other side, all these people who viewed would think I'm potentially a criminal as well. ""I felt sick for a while. I had basically shown all these people around and I'd been complicit in a scam without realising it. ""I'd build rapport with these people and I was all very friendly and nice with them and some of them lost thousands. It was over two grand for the deposit and the month's rent. ""I felt like I'd sleepwalked into this. I just saw the advert, he'd lured me in with the promise of more work and I helped him rip off all these people."" Hamish, Tony and Mary have all reported the incident to the police. BBC Scotland has attempted to contact the real owners of the short-term let in Old Fishmarket Close for comment. We were unable to reach the owner of the landlord registration number. There is no suggestion either had any involvement in Wilson's scheme. Edinburgh has experienced a growth in short term lets but also has shortage of affordable housing Edinburgh has a set of conditions that allowed a scam like Wilson's to work so effectively. While it has experienced a growth in short-term lets, it also has a shortage of affordable housing. Rents have risen faster there than in any other part of Scotland - a one-bedroom flat in the city now averages at Â£799 a month. The City of Edinburgh Council is gathering evidence to introduce a rent pressure zone in the city centre. It is also consulting on new planning rules for short-term lets but Scotland-wide legislation has been delayed. Campaigners say the high rental prices mean students looking to live in the city while studying are ""vulnerable to scams, profiteering landlords and unsafe accommodation"". Matt Crilly, president of NUS Scotland, called on the Scottish government to introduce a new strategy for student housing. He said: ""The current housing crisis in parts of Scotland has left many students homeless with students pushed to look on unregulated websites for accommodation and others staying in hostels and sofa-surfing just to access their education. ""With new students due to arrive at many universities in January, there is a risk the crisis will be exacerbated. We urgently need the Scottish government to deliver on their promise of a student housing strategy for Scotland and ensure every student has access to safe, affordable housing."" Thomas managed to spot Wilson's scheme before he handed over any money While Hamish managed to get his money back from his bank, Mary is so far still out of pocket. Meanwhile, law student Thomas Rofe managed to spot Wilson's scheme before he handed over any money. But just a week later, he was scammed out of Â£450 after a fake landlord asked for money upfront to view another property. His mum sent the money but no viewing was ever arranged. The 23-year-old is now renting a small two-bedroom tenement flat in Marchmont, where the kitchen is in the living room. It costs Thomas and his flatmate Â£1,350 a month. ""The more and more you look into, the more you hear of people falling victim to these things recently,"" he said. ""It does seem that people have noticed there is a real struggle for property, not just in Edinburgh but all over Scotland, and there are people who are willing to take advantage of that to gain as much money as they can."" Meta, the company that runs Facebook, said it was sorry to hear that Hamish was misled and that it encouraged people to report sophisticated scams to the police. A spokeswoman said: ""We've dedicated significant resources to tackle the industry-wide issue of online scams by working to detect and remove scam ads and fraudulent behaviour. ""We continue to invest in new technologies and methods to protect people, and have donated Â£3m to Citizens Advice to deliver a UK Scam Action Programme which raises awareness of online scams and helps victims."" A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed that an investigation was under way after officers received reports of potentially fraudulent activity involving flats on Old Fishmarket Close and elsewhere in Edinburgh. He said: ""Police Scotland is acutely aware that criminals will take any opportunity to exploit any situation for their own gain. We would ask the public to continue to be mindful and to call 101 if they have any concerns that you may be the victim of a scam."" The spokesman said advice was available on its website,external.

Al Swealmeen, who died in the attack on Sunday, was a failed asylum seeker who had been refused permission to stay in the UK. It comes after newspaper reports suggested changing religion could be a way to ""game the asylum system"". The Home Office declined to comment. Al Swealmeen, 32, who was born in Iraq, died in the explosion outside Liverpool Women's Hospital. Police believehe had been planning an attackfor months. He hadmade a legal attemptto gain permission to stay in the UK but it was rejected without being considered in court. Liverpool bomber had been planning attack since April Bomber was refused permission for asylum appeal Suspect seemed a genuine Christian, says church worker It is not clear if the Home Office told Al Swealmeen he would be removed from the country or if it took any steps towards doing so. And it is not yet known where he was seeking asylum from. In a statement, the Church of England said ""it is not the role of clergy"" to establish whether an asylum claim was legitimate. And the Church's home affairs advisersaid baptism was taken ""extremely seriously"",externaland not carried out just because it was asked for - ""and never as a means to dodge the law"". There is no evidence being a member of the Church would fast-track an asylum claim, said Benedict Ryan, who also pointed out there were ""many genuine Christian converts"" who sought asylum. Liverpool Cathedral, where Al Swealmeen's conversion ceremony took place, said it had ""developed robust processes"" to work out if someone seeking religious conversion was genuine. If someone can prove they would be persecuted in their home country as a result of their religious belief, that can form the basis of an asylum claim. In countries such as Iran, religious minorities - and particularly Christians - face intensive oppression. The charity Open Doors ranks Iran as the eighth worst country in the world for Christian persecution and Iranians are the most common nationality claiming asylum in the UK, according to Home Office figures. Many churches around the UK have large asylum seeker populations and some see high numbers converting from other faiths such as Islam to Christianity. Church groups say this is because many asylum seekers find support through Christian projects. But assessing whether someone's religious conversion is real or not is nearly impossible. Previous Home Office initiatives such as asking claimants to recite the Ten Commandmentshave been criticisedfor lacking religious literacy. A spokesperson for the Church of England said while it welcomed all who ""choose to make a commitment to Christ"", there was ""also a need for discernment"". Clergy ""must be confident that those seeking baptism fully understand what it signifies"", they added. ""However it is not the role of clergy to establish the legitimacy of asylum claims and to assess security implications,"" said the spokesperson. ""We are not aware of any evidence to suggest a widespread correlation between conversion to Christianity, or any other faith, and abuse of the asylum system."" A Liverpool Cathedral spokesperson said: ""Liverpool Cathedral has developed robust processes for discerning whether someone might be expressing a genuine commitment to faith. ""These include requirements for regular attendance alongside taking part in a recognised Christian basics course. We would expect someone to be closely connected with the community for at least two years before we would consider supporting an application."" Al Swealmeen had been baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 but the cathedral lost contact with him the following year. The cathedral spokesman also said ""welcoming people into a worshipping community"" was one way it engaged with asylum seekers. A church worker in Liverpool who once housed Al Swealmeen saidhe believed he was a ""genuine Christian"". Malcolm Hitchcott had befriended him through a Christianity course run for asylum seekers. Members of the congregation at Emmanuel Church in Fazakerley, Liverpool, which Al Swealmeen attended from 2017 to 2019, said he had been ""a committed Christian"" who baked for church cake sales. The Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen - known to parishioners as Enzo - ""made no secret"" of the fact he had mental health problems and was ""a really kind guy"".

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised for saying a ""significant cloud"" hung over the name of the late bishop of Chichester. In 1995, a woman alleged the Rt Rev George Bell, who died in 1958, had sexually abused her when she was a girl. The police were called in only after she wrote to the archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in 2013. The Church settled with her out of court, in 2015, and issued an apology. However, a review of the case, in 2017, said the Church had ""rushed to judgement"" in assuming Bishop Bell's guilt. On Wednesday, Archbishop Welby released a personal statement, saying he did not ""consider there to be a 'significant cloud' over Bishop George Bell's name"". While insisting allegations of abuse ""must be taken seriously"", he added, ""we also owe a duty of care to those who are accused"". Bishop Bell was bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death, in 1958, and was praised for his criticism of the RAF bombing of German civilians in World War Two. He also played a part in organising the Kindertransport rescue, of Jewish children from the Nazis. He was later honoured with an official Anglican holy day dedicated to his life. In 1995, a woman alleged Bishop Bell had abused her when she was a little girl - but that claim was not initially investigated. In 2013, the complainant, known only as Carol, wrote to Archbishop Welby and the matter was referred to the police. The Rt Rev George Bell was bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death, in 1958 In 2015, the Church of England paid Â£16,800 in an out-of-court settlement and apologised. However a review, in 2017, by Lord Carlile QC, criticised the Church for a ""rush to judgement"" in assuming Bishop Bell's guilt and said it had not been fair to both sides. The bishop had been ""hung out to dry"" and the ""truth of what Carol was saying was implicitly accepted without serious investigation or inquiry"", Lord Carlile said. However, in the aftermath of Lord Carlile's report, Archbishop Welby refused to exonerate Bishop Bell and said, in January 2018, a ""significant cloud is left over his name"". ""Bishop Bell was in many ways a hero. He is also accused of great wickedness. No human being is entirely good or bad,"" Archbishop Welby said at the time. Later in 2018, the Church said publicly it had referred ""fresh information"" to Sussex Police. A subsequent review said there was no evidence behind these latest claims. In Wednesday's personal statement, Archbishop Welby said the ""Church is on a journey of thoroughgoing repentance"" for previously ignoring claims of abuse. ""This is why the posthumous allegations made against Bishop George Bell were taken seriously and investigated fully,"" he said. ""What I say today that is new and should have been said sooner is this, 'I do not consider there to be a 'significant cloud' over Bishop George Bell's name.' ""Previously, I refused to retract that statement and I was wrong to do so. I took that view because of the importance we rightly place on listening to those who come forward with allegations of abuse and the duty of care we owe to them. ""But we also owe a duty of care to those who are accused. I apologise for the hurt that my refusal to retract that statement has caused to Bishop Bell's surviving relatives, colleagues and longstanding supporters. ""They have all raised this issue, often powerfully, and I have recognised my error as a result of their advocacy."" Archbishop Welby praised Bishop Bell as ""one of the most courageous, distinguished Anglican bishops of the past century"". ""The debt owed to him extends far beyond the Church that he served and is one that we share as a society,"" he said. ""I am delighted that the statue to him that was planned will be erected on the west front of Canterbury Cathedral.""

"A new Westminster lobbying scandal could be sparked by the actions of MPs sitting on informal committees, a standards watchdog has warned. Labour's Chris Bryant fears some All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) - as they are known - are being used as a ""backdoor"" for commercial interests. An estimated Â£30m has been poured into APPGs over the past five years, according to a BBC investigation. It comes as the government plans to ban MPs from having certain second jobs. Mr Bryant - who chairs the Commons standards committee - has welcomed the proposed ban, which is meant to prevent MPs from being paid to influence government policy. But his committee has also launched an investigation into how APPGs are run and regulated. PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Call for greater transparency around lobbying What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Bryant - who chairs APPGs on Russia and Acquired Brain Injury - says these kind of groups can play a vital role drawing Parliament's attention to overlooked issues. He does not want to see APPGs banned, but he says he wants to make it easier to find out who is funding them and why. Under the current system, most of the groups do not produce, or make readily available, a detailed breakdown of their funding and spending. This video can not be played Chris Bryant MP says he supports a ban on some second jobs Mr Bryant told BBC News many APPGs ""now seem to have become the parliamentary arm of lobbying and PR companies"", and there were real concerns about their ""transparency and propriety"". He warned the way some groups are being run ""has the potential to become another lobbying scandal"", adding: ""These groups cannot be a back door for peddling influence or gaining access to MPs. ""The Parliamentary logo is not for sale."" APPGs are informal committees set up by MPs and peers with a shared interest, ranging from leisure pursuits such as jazz, beer or campsites to serious policy areas like coronavirus, cancer and migration. They can set up meetings with ministers, publish reports and hold evidence sessions - but they should not be confused with select committees. Unlike select committees, they have no official status and are not funded by taxpayers. The number of APPGs has dramatically increased in recent years - there are currently 744 of them,according to the official register,external, more than three times the number of select committees - and so has the amount of money going in to them. Most APPGs do not receive any funding, but a growing number are sponsored by companies, campaign groups or charities to cover running costs and foreign trips. The money does not go to individual MPs or peers. According to BBC research, an estimated Â£30.7m - as published on the APPG register - has been funnelled into the groups since 2017. Of that total, an estimated Â£6.4m was donated by companies registered as lobbyists. But some critics say this could be the tip of the iceberg, as some lobbyists are not registered. The donations largely come through what is known as ""benefits in kind"". This is where a funding company's staff act as the secretariat for the group and, in some cases, pay for reports to be published and organise events at which government ministers are present. APPGs attracting the most funding include those dedicated to artificial intelligence, Christians in Parliament, the internet and technology - with Google donating at least Â£30,000 since 2018 - ""left behind"" neighbourhoods, international development and reproductive health. MPs Matt Hancock (second from right) and Damian Green (far right) at the launch of the Longevity APPG The Longevity APPG, which focuses on ageing and the promotion of longer, healthier lives, has recently come under scrutiny from the standards committee. The group is chaired by Conservative MP Damian Green and says it aims ""to turn the 'problem' of ageing into one of the most promising opportunities of the 21st century"". It has received more than Â£150,000 worth of funding, including some cash from healthcare companies, since 2019 - and was backed by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock,who spoke at the launch of a report,external. In September, thestandards committee raised questions,externalover the group offering platinum, gold and bronze levels of membership for sponsors, with a fee of up to Â£100,000 for access to meetings. Some MPs on the committee were taken aback by this revelation, with Mr Bryant saying: ""That's quite high up there on the badness register, isn't it?"" The APPG on Longevity told us it had dropped the scheme, adding: ""No sponsor was ever involved in the tiered membership described in the early version of the sponsorship proposal. ""The amount of funding is not linked in any way with access to the APPG's events/programmes."" The standards committee is also concerned about APPGs being funded by foreign governments. Only a very small number out of the 133 groups dedicated to countries have been found to have financial links to foreign governments, but those that have are controversial. Robert Halfon says there are ""no strings"" attached to the sponsorship A regime accused of corruption and thesilencing of journalists,externalhas spent thousands of pounds on trips and events for politicians on the APPG for the Kurdistan Region in Iraq since 2014. The group says it aims ""to promote friendship and understanding"" between the UK and the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. The trips included meeting senior politicians and officials. The funding was either paid for directly by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) or by companies that have been linked to the authority. Since 2016, the all-party group has received more than Â£200,000 from the KAR group, an Iraqi-Kurdish engineering company linked in leaked US State Department cables to the KRG. The group, which is chaired by Conservative MP Robert Halfon, with fellow Conservative Jack Lopresti as vice-chairman, insists there are ""no strings attached"" to its funding. ""The sponsorship supports the secretary in carrying out the wishes of the members,"" it said in a statement, adding: ""We do not and will not lobby for the sponsor, which has never asked us to do so."" The group said ""the KAR Group is an entirely privately run and owned company"". Steve Goodrich, of campaign group Transparency International UK, said: ""The laxness of the rules governing these groups not only provides an open door to foreign interference, it also allows some parliamentarians to blur the lines between their public and private roles in a way that should not be tolerated."" Sir Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative member of the standards committee, has expressed concerns that APPG reports are being mistaken by the public for select committee reports - often because they are both reported by the media as being by ""a cross-party committee of MPs"". The MP, who chairs the powerful liaison committee of select committee chairs - which is due to grill Boris Johnson on Wednesday - has suggested reports should be clearly labelled with their sponsors' name. ""Transparency is all,"" he told BBC News. ""The public should have the confidence that no-one is getting privileged access to, or influence over, MPs and ministers"". The PR industry argues that it is helping MPs educate themselves about important issues at no cost to taxpayers by sponsoring APPGs - and that none have been found to have broken Commons rules. But these rules could be tightened up next year, when the standards committee produces its report. Additional reporting: Ed Lowther and Will Dahlgreen Correction and update 1st December: This article originally reported that the Committee on Standards evidence session took place in October. In fact it was in September and so this line has been amended and we have also included some more details in response from the APPG on Longevity.

"As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel describes the situation as ""dramatic"" Some 22,479 Covid cases were recorded in the Czech Republic yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began It comes as cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36,626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week Covid restrictions had a ""catastrophic effect"" on the arts, culture and heritage sectors, a University of Sheffield report says Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks last year UK health officials warn of a ""hidden pandemic"" of antibiotic-resistant infections if people fail to act responsibly after Covid Spectators will be allowed to go to New Year's Eve celebrations in New York's Times Square, after it was cancelled last year Edited by Emma Harrison Today's reporting was brought to you by Joseph Lee, Jen Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, George Wright, Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin, Suzanne Leigh and Tiffany Wertheimer We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly. The Airport Operators Association said while European airports were working at 60% or 70% of capacity over summer, in the UK they ""struggled to get above the low double digit percentages"". If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main headlines so far today: As we've been hearing, much of Europe is facing a surge in cases and this has been blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. So what is the vaccination rate across Europe? Well, this varies. The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections. Daily infectionsrose to 14,416on Wednesday, official data
showed, the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. It comes three days into a controversial lockdown
for those not fully vaccinated aimed at halting the surge. About two million
people are not fully vaccinated and can now only leave their homes for a
limited number of reasons including going to work, shopping for essentials and
""stretching your legs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.00077030604
"As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel describes the situation as ""dramatic"" Some 22,479 Covid cases were recorded in the Czech Republic yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began It comes as cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36,626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week Covid restrictions had a ""catastrophic effect"" on the arts, culture and heritage sectors, a University of Sheffield report says Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks last year UK health officials warn of a ""hidden pandemic"" of antibiotic-resistant infections if people fail to act responsibly after Covid Spectators will be allowed to go to New Year's Eve celebrations in New York's Times Square, after it was cancelled last year Edited by Emma Harrison Today's reporting was brought to you by Joseph Lee, Jen Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, George Wright, Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin, Suzanne Leigh and Tiffany Wertheimer We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics.

If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main headlines so far today: As we've been hearing, much of Europe is facing a surge in cases and this has been blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. So what is the vaccination rate across Europe? Well, this varies. The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections. Daily infectionsrose to 14,416on Wednesday, official data
showed, the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. It comes three days into a controversial lockdown
for those not fully vaccinated aimed at halting the surge. About two million
people are not fully vaccinated and can now only leave their homes for a
limited number of reasons including going to work, shopping for essentials and

"Lidl has announced pay rises from March next year, which it says will make it the UK's highest-paying supermarket. It will increase its minimum pay for employees outside London to Â£10.10 an hour, with rates of up to Â£11.40 for more experienced workers. Higher rates will apply in the capital, the supermarket said. It added that the increase recognised ""the hard work and dedication of frontline colleagues during the last 18 months of the pandemic"". Earlier this year, Morrisons becamethe first UK supermarket to pay at least Â£10 an hour. ""Entry-level wages will increase from Â£9.50 to Â£10.10 an hour outside of London and Â£10.85 to Â£11.30 within the M25 from March 2022, with colleagues earning up to Â£11.40 and Â£12.25 respectively, depending on length of service,"" Lidl said. It comes afterofficial figures on Tuesdaysuggested that employers are continuing to struggle to fill roles, affecting the hospitality and retail sectors in particular. Job vacancies hit a fresh record high of 1.17 million in October - almost 400,000 higher than before the pandemic. With so many parts of the economy facing labour shortages, many employers are having to improve pay and conditions to fill vacancies and keep hold of the staff they have. Where are all the job vacancies? Lidl is still expanding. It currently has more than 850 stores in Great Britain and says it's still on track to increase that to 1,000 by the end of 2023. It clearly wants to have a competitive edge on hourly pay. And that will put pressure on its bigger rivals, who have far larger wage bills to pay for. Lidl said the move represented a pay rise of more than 6% for some. More than 21,000 Lidl employees, about 80% of its staff, would benefit, it added. By comparison,the UK's minimum wagefor workers over 23 is set to rise from its current level of Â£8.91 an hour to Â£9.50 from April 2022. And earlier this week,the Real Living Wage, paid by almost 9,000 employers throughout the country, went up from Â£9.50 to Â£9.90 an hour. How much is the minimum wage? Why is the cost of living going up? As for Lidl's rivals, the latest available data suggests Tesco and Aldi currently pay Â£9.55 an hour, while Sainsbury's, Waitrose and the Co-op pay Â£9.50 and Asda pays Â£9.18. Lidl said its latest pay rise would cost it Â£18m and described it as part of its UK investment plan. Nan Gibson, Lidl's chief HR officer, told the BBC: ""We do not expect to pass that on to customers in the form of price rises."" This video can not be played Lidl's HR boss Nan Gibson says it's ""very difficult"" to recruit staff at the moment She said it was currently ""very difficult"" to recruit staff, adding: ""We are competing for talent with all the other retailers and, indeed, other industries."" Ms Gibson said Lidl's pay rise was intended to retain existing staff ""as far as possible"", but also to attract new workers. The supermarket also reiterated its existing intention to have 1,000 stores in the UK by the end of 2023. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, chief executive at Lidl GB, said: ""We have ambitious plans to grow our business across Great Britain, and to do that, we need to ensure we attract and look after the best talent at every level of our business.""

"As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel describes the situation as ""dramatic"" Some 22,479 Covid cases were recorded in the Czech Republic yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began It comes as cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36,626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week Covid restrictions had a ""catastrophic effect"" on the arts, culture and heritage sectors, a University of Sheffield report says Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks last year UK health officials warn of a ""hidden pandemic"" of antibiotic-resistant infections if people fail to act responsibly after Covid Spectators will be allowed to go to New Year's Eve celebrations in New York's Times Square, after it was cancelled last year Edited by Emma Harrison Today's reporting was brought to you by Joseph Lee, Jen Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, George Wright, Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin, Suzanne Leigh and Tiffany Wertheimer We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly.

The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections. Daily infectionsrose to 14,416on Wednesday, official data
showed, the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. It comes three days into a controversial lockdown
for those not fully vaccinated aimed at halting the surge. About two million
people are not fully vaccinated and can now only leave their homes for a

Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly. The Airport Operators Association said while European airports were working at 60% or 70% of capacity over summer, in the UK they ""struggled to get above the low double digit percentages"".

persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly. The Airport Operators Association said while European airports were working at 60% or 70% of capacity over summer, in the UK they ""struggled to get above the low double digit percentages"". If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main headlines so far today: As we've been hearing, much of Europe is facing a surge in cases and this has been blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. So what is the vaccination rate across Europe? Well, this varies. The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections. Daily infectionsrose to 14,416on Wednesday, official data
showed, the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. It comes three days into a controversial lockdown
for those not fully vaccinated aimed at halting the surge. About two million
people are not fully vaccinated and can now only leave their homes for a
limited number of reasons including going to work, shopping for essentials and
""stretching your legs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.98880786
"MPs have voted in favour of new rules to curb what extra work they are allowed to do, amid the row about second jobs Johnson announced plans on Tuesday to stop MPs working as political consultants The Commons rejected a Labour motion on how to bring in the new rules, instead backing the government's plan Earlier, Boris Johnson was quizzed about second jobs at PMQs and by senior MPs on the Liaison Committee The PM admitted the government made a mistake by conflating the Owen Paterson row with his plan to overhaul the disciplinary process Labour's Keir Starmer accused the PM of being a ""coward"" for not apologising for his role in the Paterson row Edited by Francesca Gillett Thanks for following our live updates today. Today's live coverage was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, Francesca Gillett, Adam Durbin, Joseph Lee, Justin Parkinson, Paul Seddon and Kate Whannel. This is where we end our coverage of the goings-on in Parliament. Here is a round-up of the day's events:  This video can not be played Earlier today at the Liaison Committee, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt asked the prime minister if Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe could be home by Christmas. She is currently detained in Iran after being arrested five years ago, accused of plotting to overthrow the government, which she denies. The prime minister said it was a difficult case and it ""breaks my heart"" that he could not guarantee when Nazanin would be home with her husband and daughter. You can watch their exchange above. The government's alternative proposal has been backed by MPs, with 297 voting in favour and none against. Labour's motion has
been defeated. MPs are now voting on the government's alternative proposal. Like Labourâs
motion, the government amendment wants the standards committee to come up with
recommendations by the end of January which would prevent MPs from accepting paid work as a consultant. The government plan also asks the committee to produce proposals stating that ""any outside activity
undertaken by a MP should be within
reasonable limits and should not prevent them from fully carrying out their
range of duties."" However, unlike Labour's motion, it does not
specify what would happen once the committee produces its recommendations. MPs have rejected the second jobs motion from Labour. 231 MPs voted for the motion and 282 voted against. The debate on MPs' second jobs has come to an end and the voting is beginning. MPs will first vote on Labour's proposal. Their motion would order the standards committee to design rules by 31 January aimed at banning MPs from working as political consultants. Their motion also ensures MPs would get a vote on bringing in these rules, shortly after the committee publishes its recommendations. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor After PMQs and the Liaison Committee, the PM then went to face his own MPs at the 1922 committee - one texts to say, he ""looked weak and sounded weak"" and ""authority is evaporating"". Other MPs leaving the meeting of Tories where the PM was speaking: ""He needs a lemsip"", ""excellent"", ""muted"" and ""fair to say it's been a rough couple of weeks"". The House of Commons is currently debating Labour and Conservative plans to change the system of rules on MPs' second jobs. And they're both fairly complex. Labour's motion would order Parliament's standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January, designed to bring in a ban on MPs working as political consultants. The motion also says that, if the government doesn't grant MPs a vote on these new rules within 15 days of that date, backbench MPs would get the power to force one. But the government has proposed an alternative plan. Its amendment to the motion would still see the committee coming up with recommendations by the same date - 31 January - but what happens next is left unclear. The votes are expected soon. Labour MP Zarah Sultana talks about her surprise on becoming an MP in 2019, and seeing the gifts and dinners that companies lavish on parliamentarians to influence them. One of them was Heathrow Airport, which sent a food hamper to encourage MPs to vote for a third runway, she says. ""I was surprised to walk down corridor where big businesses host
dinners for MPs. Over a glass of fine wine and a big meal, they extend their influence,"" she says. Quoting a quip by former Bolsover MP Dennis Skinner, she says fact-finding missions paid for by business are always to destinations like the Bahamas in winter - not Greenland. MPs are already in the UK's top 5% of earners, but for some that is not enough, Sultana says. With both of the UK's largest political parties debating their plans to reform to the rules around what second roles MPs can hold, it might be a good time to remind ourselves what the existing system allows. Currently MPs are allowed to take on a second role, as long as they are not a government minister. They must publicly declare any additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%. Those who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving. They are banned from lobbying the government for two years as well. In addition, all MPs are ""strictly forbidden"" from being paid for ""advocating a particular matter"" in Parliament. Read more here. Conservative MP Danny Kruger says former colleague Owen Paterson - who has quit Parliament after being found to have broken rules on lobbying - is his friend. He adds that Paterson has done ""good service to the state"" - but does not defend his actions on behalf of two companies that prompted the current row over second jobs. Reality Check At PMQs earlier, Boris Johnson repeatedly
referred to Sir Keir Starmerâs earnings as a lawyer and, in particular, money
heâd been paid by law firm Mishcon de Reya since he was elected to Parliament
in 2015. Starmer's entries in the MPs' register of interests show he
was paid Â£7,060 by Mishcon de Reya for legal advice in December 2015, and Â£4,500 per month between June and September in 2016 for legal advice to
the Mishcon de Reya Academy, which provides training. In total, Sir Keir has earned over Â£100,000 from his legal
work since becoming an MP, although none since he became Labour leader last year. Some of the payments he has received have come from
sources that are not named in the register. Starmer says the sources of
those payments werenât named to protect client confidentiality. The Labour leader says he gave up his practising
certificate nearly two years ago, so he is no longer able to give legal advice. After PMQs and a marathon questioning by senior MPs, Boris Johnson might have been hoping the day's parliamentary wrangling was over. But debate over a Labour party motion on second jobs has been well under way for a couple of hours now. The opposition day motion on standards in public life was called after Labour unveiled its plans to ban extra jobs for MPs - unless they are public service roles - on Tuesday. But as the party announced the proposals, the prime minister revealed his own, echoing Labour's call - but one which the opposition described as merely a ""watered down"" version of their plan from the government. Following the debate MPs will vote on the two plans, expected at around 19:00. Read more about what is happening in Westminster tonight here. Meanwhile, back in the Commons, MPs continue to debate proposed changes to rules surrounding their ability to work second jobs. Tory MP Mark Fletcher says recent headlines about MPs' second jobs ""simply reinforce"" what the public feels about politicians. But he argues this is unfair and urges Labour and other opposition parties to ""dial down the mud-slinging"" against Conservatives. You can read more on the current rules for MPs' second jobshere. This video can not be played Chris Bryant challenges Johnson over MPs' standards That was lengthy session of the Liaison Committee. Here are some of the highlights: The questioning of Boris Johnson has now ended, with chair Bernard Jenkin thanking the prime minister for his time and generosity in attending the Liaison Committee for the third and final time this year. Johnson indignantly points out this is in fact the fourth time he has been grilled by the committee chairs, after a session was delayed from last year. The PM adds he will see them in 2022 - a prospect he is no doubt relishing! Thanks for sticking with us, we'll have a summary of the afternoon's events with you shortly. Jeremy Hunt, who is also a former health secretary, then asks about efforts to fill a vacancies in the NHS, which he says now stands at 93,000. He asks whether the government will back a proposal to introduce independent estimates every year for the number of doctors that need to be recruited. Boris Johnson says he is ""happy to study"" the idea, but the government has its own targets. He admits there are shortages in ""many key areas"". Richard Ratcliffe, husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, recently spent 21 days on a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office Last but not least is Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee. The former foreign secretary asks about thecase of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He says Iran has linked her release to the UK's repayment of a historic debt - and asks whether only the UK will decide on this. Boris Johnson says in an ""ideal world"" the UK would be able to resolve the issue by repaying the debt, but things are more ""complicated"" than that. He adds that he continues to be ""horrified"" by how she has been treated and the government is working ""as hard as we can"" to secure her release. He adds that it ""breaks his heart"" that he cannot guarantee, however, she will be home for Christmas. ""Are you responsible for empty shelves in Supermarkets,"" asks MacNeil. The PM says he is responsible for ""trying to help improve supply chains"". He says the problem is caused by global factors such as a shortage of HGV drivers. Has Brexit made it worse, asks the SNP MP. ""It is a pan-European problem,"" the PM replies adding that working conditions for HGV drivers should be improved. Committee chair Bernard Jenkin jokes that he could renew his HGV licence if it would help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Amazon will stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK from 19 January, the online retail giant has said. It said the move was due to high credit card transaction fees but said Visa debit cards would still be accepted. Visa said it was ""very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future"". Amazon said: ""The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers."" The online retailer said costs should be going down over time due to advances in technology, ""but instead they continue to stay high or even rise"". An Amazon spokesperson said the dispute was to do with ""pretty egregious"" price rises from Visa over a number of years with no additional value to its service. Amazon is offering Â£20 for Prime customers to switch from using Visa to an alternative payment method, and Â£10 for other customers, if they have a Visa cards as their default or only payment method on their account. Visa said in a statement it was ""very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins."" It said it had ""a long-standing relationship with Amazon"" and that it was trying to resolve the situation so customers would be able to use Visa credit cards with Amazon UK. Amazon declined to say how much Visa charges the retailer to process transactions made on credit cards. Visa also declined to comment though it claimed that on average it takes less than 0.1% of the value of a purchase. Amazon and Visa said any changes in fees had nothing to do with Brexit. Both Visa and its rivalMastercard have raised the so-called interchange feeon cross-border transactions between businesses in the UK and the European Union following Brexit. The dispute between Amazon and Visa is to do with the fees the credit card company charges Amazon for its services in the UK. Amazon is also considering dropping Visa as a partner for its US co-branded credit card. It is in talks with payment networks, including Mastercard, American Express and Visa - as part of what it calls a standard process, the BBC has learnt. This row between two corporate titans is now being played out in full view of their customers. Amazon says Visa's fees are excessive, and an obstacle to low prices for consumers. Visa says its fees are competitive, has minimal effect on prices, and that nobody wins when choice is restricted. Whether or not this row is about fees, or whether that is just a smokescreen is largely irrelevant to consumers using these services. They just know they may have to change the way they pay on Amazon. Yet, the timing is significant. These messages to customers hit home harder when people are regularly using Amazon for Christmas shopping. But it also means there is still time before January 19 for a compromise to be reached. James Andrews, senior personal finance editor at comparison website Money.co.uk, said the move ""will come as a blow to the millions of Britons"" who use Visa credit cards, including Barclaycard and HSBC customers. ""With American Express also rejected by many UK retailers, that means people looking for rewards on their spending or trying to split the cost of shopping with a 0% purchase card on Amazon will be effectively forced to choose a Mastercard,"" he said. He added that a rewards card that is offered by Amazon is ""powered by Mastercard"". Mastercard's executive vice chairman Ann Cairns, said: ""It's very important that customers have choice, and have the widest variety of ability to pay, whether that's through cards or from their bank accounts or cash, and remember that it is never the consumer that pays fees."" ""We talk to Amazon all the time because obviously we are two big global businesses and Amazon is one of our top customers around the world."" Retail analyst Steve Dressersaid in a tweet,externalthat Amazon could be aiming to bring Visa fees down with its move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said credit card fees ""charged by the handful of card providers which dominate the cashless payment space have soared in recent years"". ""Small businesses are almost always charged more for card terminals than big corporates - so when online giants start throwing down the gauntlet, you know the situation is becoming critical,"" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Businesses have had ongoing concerns about credit card fees from the major providers. Last October, Visa and Mastercard wereaccused by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) of charging excessive fees. The trade body said they had doubled in two years. At the time, the BRC warned that retailers would be forced to pass on costs to consumers, with credit card bills rising by up to Â£40. The Payment Systems Regulator said there were ""real questions about how well the cards market is working"". ""We will look into how well this market is working, including the issue of increasing card fees,"" a spokesman for the regulator said. ""If necessary we will intervene to address any issues we identify."" He said a final strategy would be published in the new year. Visa shares ended Wednesday's New York trading day down by 4.7%.

the Mishcon de Reya Academy, which provides training. In total, Sir Keir has earned over Â£100,000 from his legal
work since becoming an MP, although none since he became Labour leader last year. Some of the payments he has received have come from
sources that are not named in the register. Starmer says the sources of
those payments werenât named to protect client confidentiality. The Labour leader says he gave up his practising
certificate nearly two years ago, so he is no longer able to give legal advice. After PMQs and a marathon questioning by senior MPs, Boris Johnson might have been hoping the day's parliamentary wrangling was over. But debate over a Labour party motion on second jobs has been well under way for a couple of hours now. The opposition day motion on standards in public life was called after Labour unveiled its plans to ban extra jobs for MPs - unless they are public service roles - on Tuesday. But as the party announced the proposals, the prime minister revealed his own, echoing Labour's call - but one which the opposition described as merely a ""watered down"" version of their plan from the government. Following the debate MPs will vote on the two plans, expected at around 19:00. Read more about what is happening in Westminster tonight here. Meanwhile, back in the Commons, MPs continue to debate proposed changes to rules surrounding their ability to work second jobs. Tory MP Mark Fletcher says recent headlines about MPs' second jobs ""simply reinforce"" what the public feels about politicians. But he argues this is unfair and urges Labour and other opposition parties to ""dial down the mud-slinging"" against Conservatives. You can read more on the current rules for MPs' second jobshere.

Here are some of the highlights: The questioning of Boris Johnson has now ended, with chair Bernard Jenkin thanking the prime minister for his time and generosity in attending the Liaison Committee for the third and final time this year. Johnson indignantly points out this is in fact the fourth time he has been grilled by the committee chairs, after a session was delayed from last year. The PM adds he will see them in 2022 - a prospect he is no doubt relishing! Thanks for sticking with us, we'll have a summary of the afternoon's events with you shortly. Jeremy Hunt, who is also a former health secretary, then asks about efforts to fill a vacancies in the NHS, which he says now stands at 93,000. He asks whether the government will back a proposal to introduce independent estimates every year for the number of doctors that need to be recruited. Boris Johnson says he is ""happy to study"" the idea, but the government has its own targets. He admits there are shortages in ""many key areas"". Richard Ratcliffe, husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, recently spent 21 days on a hunger strike outside the Foreign Office Last but not least is Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Health and Social Care Committee. The former foreign secretary asks about thecase of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He says Iran has linked her release to the UK's repayment of a historic debt - and asks whether only the UK will decide on this. Boris Johnson says in an ""ideal world"" the UK would be able to resolve the issue by repaying the debt, but things are more ""complicated"" than that. He adds that he continues to be ""horrified"" by how she has been treated and the government is working ""as hard as we can"" to secure her release. He adds that it ""breaks his heart"" that he cannot guarantee, however, she will be home for Christmas. ""Are you responsible for empty shelves in Supermarkets,"" asks MacNeil. The PM says he is responsible for ""trying to help improve supply chains"". He says the problem is caused by global factors such as a shortage of HGV drivers. Has Brexit made it worse, asks the SNP MP. ""It is a pan-European problem,"" the PM replies adding that working conditions for HGV drivers should be improved. Committee chair Bernard Jenkin jokes that he could renew his HGV licence if it would help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"TikTok is trying to strengthen the detection and enforcement of rules against dangerous online challenges and hoaxes. Just over one in five teenagers has participated in an online challenge, a survey commissioned by TikTok suggests. But only one in 50 has taken part in a ""risky and dangerous"" - and fewer than one in 300 a ""really dangerous"" - one. The survey looked at teenagers' broad online experience, without focusing on any one platform. There has been widespread concern about the proliferation, across various platforms, of potentially harmful online challenges. Last year, the ""skull-breaker"" challenge, shared on TikTok, was linked to injuries. And this year, doctors warned of the risk to life and limb of the""milk-crate challenge,external"", which invited the foolhardy to climb pyramids of milk crates. But online challenges can also be positive and promote worthwhile causes, experts note, such as the ""ice-bucket challenge"", which helped raise awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The independent report, Exploring effective prevention education responses to dangerous online challenges, TikTok commissioned draws on a survey of teachers, parents and 5,400 13- to 19-year-olds in the UK, the US, Germany, Australia, Italy, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Vietnam and Argentina In response to its findings, TikTok said technology that ""alerts our safety teams to sudden increases in violating content linked to hashtags"" would be expanded ""to also capture potentially dangerous behaviour"". For example, if a hashtag such as #foodchallenge normally used to share recipes suddenly saw a spike in interest apparently connected to videos breaking the company's rules, the team would investigate. TikTok already has a policy of removing content that ""promotes or glorifies dangerous acts"". Experts contributing to the report noted: ""Adolescence is a period that has always been associated with heightened risk-taking."" But it comes at a time of heightened public debate about the impact of social media on teenagers, after whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed Facebook research into the effect Instagram had on their mental health. The TikTok research also looked at suicide and self-harm hoaxes. Some schools warned parents about Momo, for example, a sinister character with bulging eyes setting children dangerous ""challenges"" such as harming themselves. Experts said it was a hoax. But the survey indicates these can still affect children. Of those to have seen a hoax, 31% said it had had a negative impact - and 63% of those said this had been on their mental health ""Hoaxes like these often have similar characteristics - and in previous cases, false warnings have circulated suggesting that children were being encouraged to take part in 'games' which resulted in self-harm,"" TikTok said. ""These hoaxes largely spread through warning messages encouraging others to alert as many people as possible to avoid perceived negative consequences."" And as well as removing the hoaxes, it would now ""start to remove alarmist warnings about them, as they could cause harm by treating the self-harm hoax as real"". The report also highlighted previous research suggesting the number of searches for hoax challenges by children ""peaked in a way that mirrored the media coverage and public comment"". Calling for better ""media guidelines on dangerous challenges and hoax challenges"", it suggested existing guidance on the reporting of suicide, followed by many media organisations, could be a model. TikTok said it had worked ""to develop a new resource for our Safety Centre dedicated to challenges and hoaxes"" and sought expert advice to improve warning labels that appear to people who search Tiktok for content related to harmful challenges or hoaxes. ""A new prompt will encourage community members to visit our Safety Centre to learn more,"" it said. ""And should people search for hoaxes linked to suicide or self-harm, we will now display additional resources in search.""

"People in Scotland can expect a ""normal Christmas"" with some Covid measures, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC that the extension of the vaccine passport scheme and other mitigations would help people live normally. Last winter Scotland was under the toughest level of lockdown restrictions from 26 December until March. Mr Swinney said he wanted to avoid further closure of businesses ""at all possible costs"". He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe Scottish government was trying to manage Covid to a level that ""enables most of our economy and society to function as close to normality"" as possible. ""I'm very hopeful that this could be a normal Christmas,"" he added. ""It will be a normal Christmas with us all taking care, is what I would say. ""We may have to put in place some additional measures to make sure that is the case."" Live: Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement to MSPs How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Mr Swinney said such measures included the extension of the vaccine passport scheme, as well as ""intensifying"" the vaccine programme. Earlier, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that vaccine certification could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December. She said a final decision would not be taken until next Tuesday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Changes to Scotland's coronavirus certification scheme under review The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. A decision had been widely expected to be made this week, with opposition leaders accusing the government of creating ""wholly avoidable uncertainty"" for businesses that could be affected. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs there had been a ""gradual increase"" in new cases of Covid-19 over the last two weeks, with pressure on the health service expected to increase in winter. The first minister said the vaccine passport scheme was making ""an important and proportionate contribution to stemming transmission"". She said the government was also considering whether a negative test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. She also said choosing not to be vaccinated without good reason was ""deeply irresponsible,"" and urged people to do their ""civic duty"" by getting jabbed. Covid cases in Scotland have started to rise again, having plateaued for several week The government has updated its ""strategic framework,external"" paper with plans for the winter period ahead, with warnings that the country ""risks moving potentially rapidly"" into a challenging situation should a new variant of the virus emerge. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said hospitality venues had been offered a ""stay of execution"", but warned that any expansion of the certification scheme would ""force many premises into closure"". Managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Businesses need time to plan for something major like this, and vague comments like those from Nicola Sturgeon today leave us in limbo for another week as we approach the vital Christmas trading period."" Ministers are watching the situation in Europe very carefully. Many countries there are having to reimpose restrictions because of soaring case numbers. Public health experts don't yet know if this is a new wave that could be coming Scotland's way, or if this is what we already faced back in September. The Scottish government is said to be at a fork in the road, but it can't choose which path to take until it knows the direction of travel of the virus. There is a degree of confidence that three key hurdles have been overcome: pupils are back in school, students have returned to universities and colleges and COP26 has passed without a massive spike in cases. But with Christmas fast approaching, the decision on whether or not to extend vaccine certification will have to be made soon. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there ""continues to be a sense of anxiety"" among firms about an extension to the scheme, and that ""it would hit consumer confidence and increase costs for businesses"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said there were ""so many unanswered questions about the practicalities of a dramatically expanded scheme"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He said: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought."" The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer financial support if new measures are introduced. He also said Ms Sturgeon should accept that providing a negative test should have been an option in the system from the outset, saying: ""Testing should always have been at the heart of our Covid reduction strategy."" The first minister said allowing a negative test to be included was a ""finely balanced"" decision, saying it could be argued that the scheme had helped to drive vaccine uptake. However, she said Scotland may now be in a position to include this option due to high levels of uptake of the vaccine. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government should use the COP26 conference as a model for using regular testing to control the virus rather than vaccine certificates. Data published by Public Health Scotland on Tuesday suggested that only four in every 1,000 delegates tested positive during the Glasgow event, compared with an infection rate of 12 in every 1,000 in Scotland as a whole.

There's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do. The rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their Â£81,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster. So, MPs can continue to work in professions like the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy. But they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients. MPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer/client is involved, they have to declare an interest. Any breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons.

"Prices in the UK went up by 2.6% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for eight months. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIrose by 2.6% in the year to November 2024, up from 2.3% in the 12 months to October. The November figure is the highest rate since March 2024. This was largely as a result of increased fuel and clothing prices. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. Some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - are still seeing significant price rises. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October. In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said itcould be a ""bit more aggressive"" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control. However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained -includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Baileysaid the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision will be on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper?

Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September.

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2% in October, up from 1.7% in September. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB)cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%,the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates three times:to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December,external. US inflation was2.7% in November, up from to 2.6% in October, as a result of higher petrol and food costs. At its September meeting,the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted. In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut,taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%. Ratesfell again in December, taking the target range to between 4.25% to 4.5%.

"Emad Al Swealmeen (on right in light grey jacket) during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside the bishop Right Reverend Cyril Ashton The Liverpool bomb attacker was a failed asylum seeker who had been refused permission by judges to appeal to stay in the country. It had been reported - but unconfirmed - that Emad Al Swealmeen lost his asylum claim as long ago as 2014. The BBC has now confirmed he made a legal attempt to gain permission to stay in the UK, but it was rejected without being considered in court. It raises questions as to whether the Home Office then sought to remove him. The Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, a national court that deals with appeals, told the BBC that Al Swealmeen had sought to lodge an appeal after he had lost his case in a lower court that reviews Home Office decisions. But this attempted appeal to the court was refused without ever going to a full hearing - meaning that a judge concluded there were no grounds to overturn the decision. The tribunal has not confirmed when that decision was taken but it is believed to have been in early 2017. Malcolm Hitchcott, a Christian activist in Liverpool, told the BBC he and his wife offered Al Swealmeen a place to stay for eight months from April of that year after he had told them he had lost his case and was destitute. Typically, when someone loses an asylum claim and exhausts their rights to appeal, the Home Office withdraws their financial support and housing and warns them they will be removed from the UK. It is not clear if the Home Office ever told Al Swealmeen he would be removed from the country or whether it took any steps to do so. It is also not yet known where he was seeking asylum from. The Home Office has been contacted for comment. Suspect seemed genuine Christian - church worker Bomb hospital boss thanks 'brave, dedicated' staff Terror threat level 'severe' after Liverpool blast Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Earlier, Mr Hitchcott told BBC Radio Merseyside he and his wife, Elizabeth Hitchcott, had befriended Emad Al Swealmeen, who they also knew as Enzo Almeni when he was destitute. He had come into contact with them through Liverpool Cathedral. There, Christian volunteers worked with predominantly Iranian asylum seekers as they took part in a popular course introducing newcomers to the faith, known as Alpha. Mr Hitchcott said they had not seen Al Swealmeen in the four subsequent years after he left their home. ""He wanted to be a Christian. And he liked what he heard about salvation by faith. And that's what we taught him,"" said Mr Hitchcott. ""He was on the streets, basically... he arrived here on April 2017, he was with us then eight months. During that time we saw him really blossoming as regard to his Christian faith. Every night we used to pray, my wife and him and if there was anybody else in the house we prayed for half an hour or so and studied the scriptures and we had a great time together. ""And I was in no doubt by the time that he left us at the end of that eight months, that he was a Christian."" Malcolm Hitchcott, left, told BBC Merseyside that Al Swealmeen had had ""a real passion for Jesus Christ"" Mr Hitchcott said that he understood that Al Swealmeen had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act some time before his original asylum case was rejected. There have been reports this related to an incident where he had been wielding a knife in public. Ewan Roberts, who works at Asylum Link, a Liverpool-based organisation which supported Al Swealmeen during his application to remain in the UK, said: ""It's quite horrific. There's no place for hate in the world and there's no place for things like that. ""We support thousands of people each year. So when someone that you have helped does something like that it's really hard to deal with it and understand why - we have to try and understand."" This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames Earlier, it emerged that Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity from Islam. The Diocese of Liverpool's communications director, Stuart Haynes, said he believed Al Swealmeen was baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - but the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018. The Right Reverend Cyril Ashton, the bishop who confirmed Al Swealmeen and who is pictured with him at the cathedral, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the bombing. ""His confirmation was one of hundreds I have conducted as a bishop so I have no specific recollection of the individual. The church takes confirmation seriously and I know that he would have been thoroughly prepared with an understanding of the Christian faith. ""It seems that sadly, despite this grounding, the bomber chose a different path for his life.""

"Official figures are expected to confirm what we all know, or have suspected, from experience in recent weeks - that the cost of living is now rising faster than it has for some time. Prices are going up at a relatively rapid rate on a variety of items and services. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has evenapologised for the situation. ""None of us want to see that happen,"" he says. The reasons behind those rising prices can be complicated. Here are five examples that help to explain why we are feeling the pinch: The cost of getting around is getting more expensive. The popular ride-hailing app recently increased its base fare in London by 10%. Travellers in the capital who want to get from the airport at peak times are now also facing a 15% surcharge. Uber says increased demand means it needs more drivers. By raising fares, the firm hopes to attract new drivers, and tempt back those who have gone to work for delivery firms instead. And of course, the queues outside petrol forecourts are still fresh in the memory for anyone trying to travel. Petrol prices have been rising since there were queues at forecourts Motorists with their own petrol or diesel car, can now fill up the tank without a wait, but prices remain high. Motoring group, the RAC says that unleaded petrol hit 146p a litre, and diesel reached 150p a litre in recent days. ""This means, filling up a 55-litre family car with unleaded has now topped Â£80 for the first time ever,"" says RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. The high cost of oil and the component parts of the fuel mean drivers will face an ""excruciatingly expensive winter"", he adds, especially for those on a low income who use their car to travel to work each day. If you want a compendium of issues that are causing price rises in general, then consider the example of do-it-yourself (DIY) and home improvements. Prices for some paints have risen by around 10% The pandemic, global demand, shipping costs, plus a shortage of workers are all reasons why it is now more expensive to put up a garden fence. The cost of timber has doubled compared to a year ago, owing to all those reasons, so not only fences, but also interior walls, have become pricier. Covid pushed up the cost of raw materials, and shipping container prices from China saw a more than fourfold rise, says Rico Wojtulewicz, head of housing and planning policy at the National Federation of Builders. That contributed to a 25% rise in the price of materials for renovations. ""Not all materials are immediately available, so anyone having work done is likely to see prices rise again by the time works start. The cost of labour has also gone up by an average of 20%,"" he adds. ""If you are getting new windows, or doors, the plastic used has gone up by around 13%. Insulation [cost] has gone up by 20% and is going up again next year. Even paint is 10% more expensive than it was in 2020,"" he says. To be specific, we are talking the kind of processed snacks popular among all age groups - Pringles, Doritos, Hula Hoops, and so on. Prices for these snacks went up by 7.6% in the 12 weeks to the end of October, compared with the same period a year earlier, information from data firm, Kantar shows. Snacks are not subject to so many price promotions Prices for canned colas, potato crisps and cat food also all went up by nearly 6%, or more, at the same time, the data show. Part of the reason is a hangover from the struggles caused by the pandemic. How have you adapted to rising prices? Are you shopping or living your life differently as a result? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, explains that price were rising during the height of the pandemic because there was less discounting in supermarkets. In order to ensure there is stock on the shelves, retailers have used fewer promotions. That also means people are now far less loyal about where they shop. ""As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals,"" he says. ""Already, households visit an average of 3.3 supermarkets per month, in order to find the best value for money."" The latest price rises are the result of added complexity as they include various issues on the chain of supply, and in getting products to the shelves. Why is the cost of living going up? Food prices in general are rising, but not at the same rate as some other products. However, the latest Kantar figures show they are still going up faster than at anytime since August 2020. Supermarkets operate in an extremely competitive environment, and analysts suggest they will be keen to keep prices down and retain their customers over the vital Christmas trading period. As the mercury dips, so the cost of heating our homes rises - and it is going to hit some people very hard in coming months. The rising cost of gas has been well documented in recent weeks. The cost to suppliers on the wholesale markets soared to unprecedented levels, for reasons which arecomplex and global. The effect on your domestic energy bill has been seen in three key ways: Firstly,a host of suppliers have gone bust. Their customers have been moved to another supplier, but on a more expensive tariff Secondly, many customers of remaining firms have been told that their monthly direct debit demand is going up Thirdly, there is protection for customers on variable tariffs, through regulator Ofgem's price cap, but this limit was put up to a new high in October and is likely to rise by hundreds of pounds more in April Rising domestic energy bills are influential in the forecast for the inflation rate (measuring the rising cost of living as a whole), rising in the coming months, before being expected to drop as the situation eases. Scott Byrom, chief executive of price comparison website TheEnergyShop, says: ""The bubble has not burst yet."" While a warm winter may help some suppliers offer better deals than they would otherwise have expected, everyone should still brace for significant further price rises, he says. That hit will be felt particularly hard among poorer people, as heating and eating take up a bigger proportion of household income. Motoring group, the AA, says that some cars are gaining in value as they sit on the driveway. Three to five-year-old Ford Fiestas, the most popular on its AA Cars website, are valued at Â£9,770 compared to Â£7,448 two years ago. The car market has various dynamics which intersect to drive price trends The steepest increase was the price of a three-year-old Mini Hatch, which in 2021 was 57% higher (Â£15,367) than a model of the same age in 2019 (Â£9,811). The trend is so significant to cost of living data in general that it has been regularly highlighted by the official collector of the numbers - the Office for National Statistics. The main driver (pun intended) for second-hand car prices is pressure on manufacturing new vehicles. A global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market. Rising demand means rising prices. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel describes the situation as ""dramatic"" Some 22,479 Covid cases were recorded in the Czech Republic yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began It comes as cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36,626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week Covid restrictions had a ""catastrophic effect"" on the arts, culture and heritage sectors, a University of Sheffield report says Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks last year UK health officials warn of a ""hidden pandemic"" of antibiotic-resistant infections if people fail to act responsibly after Covid Spectators will be allowed to go to New Year's Eve celebrations in New York's Times Square, after it was cancelled last year Edited by Emma Harrison Today's reporting was brought to you by Joseph Lee, Jen Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, George Wright, Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin, Suzanne Leigh and Tiffany Wertheimer We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly. The Airport Operators Association said while European airports were working at 60% or 70% of capacity over summer, in the UK they ""struggled to get above the low double digit percentages"". If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main headlines so far today: As we've been hearing, much of Europe is facing a surge in cases and this has been blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. So what is the vaccination rate across Europe? Well, this varies. The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections.

"A new Westminster lobbying scandal could be sparked by the actions of MPs sitting on informal committees, a standards watchdog has warned. Labour's Chris Bryant fears some All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) - as they are known - are being used as a ""backdoor"" for commercial interests. An estimated Â£30m has been poured into APPGs over the past five years, according to a BBC investigation. It comes as the government plans to ban MPs from having certain second jobs. Mr Bryant - who chairs the Commons standards committee - has welcomed the proposed ban, which is meant to prevent MPs from being paid to influence government policy. But his committee has also launched an investigation into how APPGs are run and regulated. PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Call for greater transparency around lobbying What is lobbying? A brief guide Mr Bryant - who chairs APPGs on Russia and Acquired Brain Injury - says these kind of groups can play a vital role drawing Parliament's attention to overlooked issues. He does not want to see APPGs banned, but he says he wants to make it easier to find out who is funding them and why. Under the current system, most of the groups do not produce, or make readily available, a detailed breakdown of their funding and spending. This video can not be played Chris Bryant MP says he supports a ban on some second jobs Mr Bryant told BBC News many APPGs ""now seem to have become the parliamentary arm of lobbying and PR companies"", and there were real concerns about their ""transparency and propriety"". He warned the way some groups are being run ""has the potential to become another lobbying scandal"", adding: ""These groups cannot be a back door for peddling influence or gaining access to MPs. ""The Parliamentary logo is not for sale."" APPGs are informal committees set up by MPs and peers with a shared interest, ranging from leisure pursuits such as jazz, beer or campsites to serious policy areas like coronavirus, cancer and migration. They can set up meetings with ministers, publish reports and hold evidence sessions - but they should not be confused with select committees. Unlike select committees, they have no official status and are not funded by taxpayers. The number of APPGs has dramatically increased in recent years - there are currently 744 of them,according to the official register,external, more than three times the number of select committees - and so has the amount of money going in to them. Most APPGs do not receive any funding, but a growing number are sponsored by companies, campaign groups or charities to cover running costs and foreign trips. The money does not go to individual MPs or peers. According to BBC research, an estimated Â£30.7m - as published on the APPG register - has been funnelled into the groups since 2017. Of that total, an estimated Â£6.4m was donated by companies registered as lobbyists. But some critics say this could be the tip of the iceberg, as some lobbyists are not registered. The donations largely come through what is known as ""benefits in kind"". This is where a funding company's staff act as the secretariat for the group and, in some cases, pay for reports to be published and organise events at which government ministers are present. APPGs attracting the most funding include those dedicated to artificial intelligence, Christians in Parliament, the internet and technology - with Google donating at least Â£30,000 since 2018 - ""left behind"" neighbourhoods, international development and reproductive health. MPs Matt Hancock (second from right) and Damian Green (far right) at the launch of the Longevity APPG The Longevity APPG, which focuses on ageing and the promotion of longer, healthier lives, has recently come under scrutiny from the standards committee. The group is chaired by Conservative MP Damian Green and says it aims ""to turn the 'problem' of ageing into one of the most promising opportunities of the 21st century"". It has received more than Â£150,000 worth of funding, including some cash from healthcare companies, since 2019 - and was backed by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock,who spoke at the launch of a report,external. In September, thestandards committee raised questions,externalover the group offering platinum, gold and bronze levels of membership for sponsors, with a fee of up to Â£100,000 for access to meetings. Some MPs on the committee were taken aback by this revelation, with Mr Bryant saying: ""That's quite high up there on the badness register, isn't it?"" The APPG on Longevity told us it had dropped the scheme, adding: ""No sponsor was ever involved in the tiered membership described in the early version of the sponsorship proposal. ""The amount of funding is not linked in any way with access to the APPG's events/programmes."" The standards committee is also concerned about APPGs being funded by foreign governments. Only a very small number out of the 133 groups dedicated to countries have been found to have financial links to foreign governments, but those that have are controversial. Robert Halfon says there are ""no strings"" attached to the sponsorship A regime accused of corruption and thesilencing of journalists,externalhas spent thousands of pounds on trips and events for politicians on the APPG for the Kurdistan Region in Iraq since 2014. The group says it aims ""to promote friendship and understanding"" between the UK and the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. The trips included meeting senior politicians and officials. The funding was either paid for directly by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) or by companies that have been linked to the authority. Since 2016, the all-party group has received more than Â£200,000 from the KAR group, an Iraqi-Kurdish engineering company linked in leaked US State Department cables to the KRG. The group, which is chaired by Conservative MP Robert Halfon, with fellow Conservative Jack Lopresti as vice-chairman, insists there are ""no strings attached"" to its funding. ""The sponsorship supports the secretary in carrying out the wishes of the members,"" it said in a statement, adding: ""We do not and will not lobby for the sponsor, which has never asked us to do so."" The group said ""the KAR Group is an entirely privately run and owned company"". Steve Goodrich, of campaign group Transparency International UK, said: ""The laxness of the rules governing these groups not only provides an open door to foreign interference, it also allows some parliamentarians to blur the lines between their public and private roles in a way that should not be tolerated."" Sir Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative member of the standards committee, has expressed concerns that APPG reports are being mistaken by the public for select committee reports - often because they are both reported by the media as being by ""a cross-party committee of MPs"". The MP, who chairs the powerful liaison committee of select committee chairs - which is due to grill Boris Johnson on Wednesday - has suggested reports should be clearly labelled with their sponsors' name. ""Transparency is all,"" he told BBC News. ""The public should have the confidence that no-one is getting privileged access to, or influence over, MPs and ministers"". The PR industry argues that it is helping MPs educate themselves about important issues at no cost to taxpayers by sponsoring APPGs - and that none have been found to have broken Commons rules. But these rules could be tightened up next year, when the standards committee produces its report.

In fact it was in September and so this line has been amended and we have also included some more details in response from the APPG on Longevity.

"As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel describes the situation as ""dramatic"" Some 22,479 Covid cases were recorded in the Czech Republic yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began It comes as cases continue to rise around Europe, with Russia recording a further 36,626 and Poland reporting a 31% rise in cases in a week Covid restrictions had a ""catastrophic effect"" on the arts, culture and heritage sectors, a University of Sheffield report says Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks last year UK health officials warn of a ""hidden pandemic"" of antibiotic-resistant infections if people fail to act responsibly after Covid Spectators will be allowed to go to New Year's Eve celebrations in New York's Times Square, after it was cancelled last year Edited by Emma Harrison Today's reporting was brought to you by Joseph Lee, Jen Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, George Wright, Emma Harrison, Adam Durbin, Suzanne Leigh and Tiffany Wertheimer We're wrapping up our live page coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form.

"Lidl has announced pay rises from March next year, which it says will make it the UK's highest-paying supermarket. It will increase its minimum pay for employees outside London to Â£10.10 an hour, with rates of up to Â£11.40 for more experienced workers. Higher rates will apply in the capital, the supermarket said. It added that the increase recognised ""the hard work and dedication of frontline colleagues during the last 18 months of the pandemic"". Earlier this year, Morrisons becamethe first UK supermarket to pay at least Â£10 an hour. ""Entry-level wages will increase from Â£9.50 to Â£10.10 an hour outside of London and Â£10.85 to Â£11.30 within the M25 from March 2022, with colleagues earning up to Â£11.40 and Â£12.25 respectively, depending on length of service,"" Lidl said. It comes afterofficial figures on Tuesdaysuggested that employers are continuing to struggle to fill roles, affecting the hospitality and retail sectors in particular. Job vacancies hit a fresh record high of 1.17 million in October - almost 400,000 higher than before the pandemic. With so many parts of the economy facing labour shortages, many employers are having to improve pay and conditions to fill vacancies and keep hold of the staff they have. Where are all the job vacancies? Lidl is still expanding. It currently has more than 850 stores in Great Britain and says it's still on track to increase that to 1,000 by the end of 2023. It clearly wants to have a competitive edge on hourly pay. And that will put pressure on its bigger rivals, who have far larger wage bills to pay for. Lidl said the move represented a pay rise of more than 6% for some. More than 21,000 Lidl employees, about 80% of its staff, would benefit, it added. By comparison,the UK's minimum wagefor workers over 23 is set to rise from its current level of Â£8.91 an hour to Â£9.50 from April 2022. And earlier this week,the Real Living Wage, paid by almost 9,000 employers throughout the country, went up from Â£9.50 to Â£9.90 an hour. How much is the minimum wage? Why is the cost of living going up? As for Lidl's rivals, the latest available data suggests Tesco and Aldi currently pay Â£9.55 an hour, while Sainsbury's, Waitrose and the Co-op pay Â£9.50 and Asda pays Â£9.18. Lidl said its latest pay rise would cost it Â£18m and described it as part of its UK investment plan. Nan Gibson, Lidl's chief HR officer, told the BBC: ""We do not expect to pass that on to customers in the form of price rises."" This video can not be played Lidl's HR boss Nan Gibson says it's ""very difficult"" to recruit staff at the moment She said it was currently ""very difficult"" to recruit staff, adding: ""We are competing for talent with all the other retailers and, indeed, other industries."" Ms Gibson said Lidl's pay rise was intended to retain existing staff ""as far as possible"", but also to attract new workers. The supermarket also reiterated its existing intention to have 1,000 stores in the UK by the end of 2023. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, chief executive at Lidl GB, said: ""We have ambitious plans to grow our business across Great Britain, and to do that, we need to ensure we attract and look after the best talent at every level of our business.""

Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world today: The latest figures show that Covid cases in the UK are continuing to rise, with 38,263 reported in the last 24-hour period. That means a rise of just over 15%, comparing the last seven days to the previous week. There were also 201 deaths recorded. The seven-day average for reported deaths from Covid continues to fall, with a decline of just under 12%. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin For the past week German infection rates have hit one record after
another. On Wednesday more than 52,000 new infections were recorded, the
highest Germany has seen in the pandemic, with 294 deaths. The
overall death toll and the infection rate in relation to the population are
both still lower than in the UK. But
unlike in the UK, the situation here is getting worse, prompting Chancellor
Angela Merkel to call it an âemergencyâ. So
far hospitals are not overwhelmed, but intensive care beds are filling up,
mostly with unvaccinated patients. So Mrs Merkel has called on anyone who has
not had the jab to come forward. Around 67% of the German population are fully
vaccinated, but the booster
programme has had a slow start. With
many regions now only allowing vaccinated people access to most services,
including bars, cafes, hairdressers and gyms, officials are hoping that might
persuade anyone still hesitant to get the vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency has said children who test positive for Covid-19 should wait 12 weeks before they get vaccinated against the virus. Previously, people were told to wait 28 days between an infection and their vaccine appointment. Extending the delay could reduce even further the ""very, very small"" risk of heart inflammation after the jab for children, the UKHSA says. The current rate of heart inflammation among under-18s who have been vaccinated is around nine per million and cases have been ""relatively mild"", officials say. Currently, the UK is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds with a first dose only, while 16- and 17-year-olds can now book their second vaccine dose 12 weeks after the first. The UKHSA says if they catch coronavirus after their first dose, they should wait until 12 weeks after the infection for the second jab. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism after he was pictured on a visit to Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland without a mask. He's up before the Commons liaison committee now, which questions the prime minister three times a year, and he's taking the opportunity to defend his actions. He says that ""there was barely 30 seconds where I wasn't wearing a mask"". ""I walked out of a room mistakenly not wearing it. I then put it on as soon as I realised I made that mistake,"" he says. ""I apologise for it, but most pictures of my visit to the hospital will show that I was duly masked throughout the remainder of the visit, and I was masked on the way into the visit."" Restrictions demanding proof of vaccination or recent recovery from Covid for entry into all indoor leisure activities - which are already being implemented in Berlin - could be extended across Germany on Thursday. There are also plans for people using public transport or
attending workplaces to provide a negative test, or
proof of recovery or vaccination. Many are now rushing to get vaccinated as the rules tighten. The health ministry said 436,000 people received a vaccine on Tuesday, including 300,000 boosters. This is the highest number for around three months. Sabine Dittmar, health expert for Germany's Social
Democrats, said she hoped 1.4 million people could be vaccinated per day. Meanwhile, yellow stars have been attached - alluding to those Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany - to the windows of some establishments adhering to the regulations. ""Healthy, tested people are unwanted here,"" reads the text printed on the homemade paper stars. One restaurant owner told Germany's state-owned broadcaster DW they were ""horrified"" to see that the Holocaust was being used by apparent Covid deniers and vaccine sceptics. MPs were earlier debating a controversy over the award of Â£600m of Covid contracts without a competitive tender to the diagnostics firm Randox - who employed Conservative MP Owen Paterson as a consultant. Health Minister Gillian Keegan had previously promised to publish the minutes of a call between her government colleague Lord Bethell, Randox and Mr Paterson. Butshe has now told the Commons that she had not been able to find them. Labour MPs called it an ""astonishing revelation"" and ""staggering"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was happy to publish all the details of the Randox contracts, which he said had already been examined by the National Audit Office. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that following the call in April 2020, Randox was awarded another Â£347m of contracts, despite failing to deliver on their earlier Â£133m contract. Mr Patterson was found by the Commons standards watchdog to have engaged in paid lobbying for Randox in breach of the rules, sparking a wider controversy about MPs' outside interests. Ministers in Northern Ireland have voted to introduce mandatory Covid passports from next month, the BBC understands. Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP all backed the proposals from Health Minister Robin Swann. But it is believed DUP ministers voted against the plan. On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said the number of unvaccinated pregnant women who ended up in hospital with Covid-19 was a ""major concern"". Now a hospital trust in Worcestershire is trying to reverse that trend by offering the vaccine at routine appointments during pregnancy. One woman said she was getting the vaccine after a friend had a difficult experience giving birth while ill with Covid. Another mother-to-be said vaccination staff had sometimes seemed unaware that Covid jabs were judged to be safe for pregnant women, with the person administering her first dose asking her: ""Are you absolutely sure?"" This video can not be played Pregnant women in Worcestershire offered Covid vaccine Sweden says it will reverse a controversial decision to stop recommending testing for people who are fully vaccinated but show Covid symptoms. Testing has fallen by some 35% in Sweden after its public health agency said in October that people displaying
symptoms no longer needed to get tested if they had received two jabs. The move was widely criticised, and now the agency has wheeled back on its advice. ""The Public Health Agency has decided to recommend that the
regions offer testing to everyone who is six years and older who
gets symptoms that may be Covid-19,"" it said in a statement. Hungary reported 10,265 new infections on Wednesday, with doctors calling for a ban on mass events and more mandatory mask-wearing. The number of confirmed cases rivals the 11,265 peak during the country's third wave, in a country with few restrictions and a vaccination rate below the European average - with 60% fully jabbed compared to 66% across the EU. Hungary, which has a population of about 10 million, requires mask-wearing on public transport and in hospitals, but has no other Covid measures in place. Instead, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has urged people to get vaccinated, making the jab compulsory for workers at state organisations and empowering private sector companies to require vaccination. The Hungarian Medical Chamber, which represents doctors, called for masks to be mandatory in all enclosed spaces, mass events to be banned and for proof of vaccination or immunity to be required for entry to restaurants, cinemas and theatres. The government has said it is monitoring the situation and will consider further measures ""if necessary"". PM Andrej Babis announced the new rules The Czech Republic will ban people
who have not been vaccinated or have not recovered from
Covid from accessing public events and services
from Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. The tightening of restrictions already in place - expected to be approved by the full cabinet on Thursday - come after a record 22,479 cases on Tuesday. Negative tests will no longer be
enough to enter events and service
establishments, Babis said on television. The move will be controversial in a country which already has a vocal anti-lockdown and anti-vax movement. A total of 58% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated, below the EU average of 65%. It comes after Austria entered a controversial lockdown for those not fully vaccinated on Monday. As the aviation industry tries to persuade MPs that the UK is being too cautious in maintaining its travel rules,let's take a look at what restrictions are still in place. There's no longer any requirement for hotel quarantine after the red list was scrapped - although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it could be reintroduced if necessary. And fully vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before travelling to the UK -as long as they can prove they got their jab in a recognised country,external. Instead, they need to buy a lateral flow test - using the free NHS ones is not permitted - and take it two days after arrival. Everyone arriving in the UK needs to fill out a passenger locator form. Unvaccinated people aged over 18 need to self-isolate for 10 days after arrival at the address on their passenger locator form. They also need to take a test three days before travelling to the UK, on day two and on day eight. MPs have been hearing from airline representatives, who have been making the case that UK rules on international travel have been damaging the industry. Willie Walsh, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, told the Transport Select Committee that the testing and quarantine requirements had been ""excessive for too long"" and there was ""no justification"" to continue requiring tests. ""The recovery is definitely being hampered by the bureaucracy associated with UK travel, where a lot of other countries have simplified their procedures,"" he said. Airlines UK told the committee that the country had a ""lost summer"" when Europe unlocked much quicker, meaning the UK aviation industry recovered more slowly. The Airport Operators Association said while European airports were working at 60% or 70% of capacity over summer, in the UK they ""struggled to get above the low double digit percentages"". If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the main headlines so far today: As we've been hearing, much of Europe is facing a surge in cases and this has been blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. So what is the vaccination rate across Europe? Well, this varies. The UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people, while Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria, which are experiencing surges in Covid cases, have rates of 105.6, 119.2 and 135.5 respectively. You can find out the progress of the vaccine rollout in any country or territory by using ourlook-up tool. Correction: This post has been amended to
clarify the UK has administered 160.1 vaccine doses per 100 people. For much of the late summer and early autumn, the UK was an outlier in Europe with infection rates stabilising at a high level, while they fell significantly across much of the continent. But in recent weeks, as UK infections have stayed broadly stable with some fluctuations up and down, several European nations have seen cases surge to their highest rates in the pandemic. That's what led UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn of ""storm clouds gathering"" over Europe, as he called on people to get their booster jabs in case a similar surge hit Britain. The number of people testing positive each day in the UK is already more than 500 per million. But in parts of central Europe like Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, it is at least double that rate. Countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland have also surged ahead of the UK in recent weeks, with case rates of more than 1,000 per million people, 900 per million people and 800 per million respectively. Germany has a lower infection rate, but the trajectory has been causing concern among officials there. However, other countries such as France, Italy and Spain have low infection rates and have only seen the first signs of an upswing. Among the explanations for the differences are differing behaviour as socialising indoors becomes more common in winter and the levels of immunity, which vary according to the level of vaccination, the number of previous infections and how much immunity has waned. As Germany grapples with record Covid cases, Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the situation as ""dramatic"". ""The fourth wave is hitting our country with full force,"" she tells a congress of German city mayors. ""The number of daily new infections is higher than ever before... and the daily death toll is also frightening."" ""It is not at all too late to decide for a first vaccination,"" she adds. The Robert Koch Institute reports that cases in Germany have increased by 52,826 as the pandemic's fourth wave tightens its grip on Europe. The central government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet this week to discuss new national restrictions, as the seven-day infection rate hits a new peak for the 10th consecutive day. There are also concerns that Germany's renowned Christmas markets could be cancelled for a second year running. Austria has hit a new daily record for Covid infections. Daily infectionsrose to 14,416on Wednesday, official data
showed, the first time they have passed the 14,000 mark. It comes three days into a controversial lockdown
for those not fully vaccinated aimed at halting the surge. About two million
people are not fully vaccinated and can now only leave their homes for a
limited number of reasons including going to work, shopping for essentials and
""stretching your legs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

"Organisations working on Covid vaccine research were one of the main targets of cyber attacks dealt with by UK computer security experts last year. The National Cyber Security Centre says it handled a record 777 incidents between August 2020 and September 2021. Itsannual review,externalsaid protecting the health sector became an urgent priority over the period. The NCSC - part of GCHQ - said one in five incidents were aimed at organisations with links to health. In one case, it helped the University of Oxford, where the AstraZeneca vaccine was developed, to protect itself against an incident which had the potential to cause significant disruption to the UK's pandemic response. According to the NCSC, the growth in reported incidents - from 723 the previous year - was due to it working to proactively identify cyber threats. But it also said that it had to respond to a surge in incidents, particularly ransomware. The attack, where users are locked out of their computer systems until they pay a fee, has become a growing concern, the NCSC said. In 2017,the NHS was a target of a ransomware attack. The NCSC said in the last year the University of Oxford's Covid vaccine researchers also faced an attempted attack involving ransonware. Should paying hacker ransoms be banned?

"This video can not be played Watch: British Columbia left devastated after storm A deadly storm described by officials as a once-in-a-century weather event has severed road and rail links around Vancouver, Canada. Two motorways connecting the West Coast city were closed after being damaged by severe flooding. Thousands of people were forced to leave their homes due to the massive storm, which struck on Sunday. A woman was killed in a highway landslide, and rescuers say at least two other people are missing. The woman's body was found near Lillooet, about 250km (155 miles) from Vancouver, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). RCMP Sgt Janelle Shoihet said that rescuers had not yet determined the number of occupied vehicles that were lost in the slide, according to AFP news agency. Motorist Kathie Rennietold CBC News,externalshe saw the landslide come down on traffic that was already at a standstill south of Lillooet. ""No sooner do we get back into our vehicles, the people that were in front of us are just screaming and running,"" she said. ""The look on their faces, it was like a tsunami was coming. It was the scariest thing that I've ever seen. ""I just turned around, and I'm just watching the whole side of the mountain coming down and taking out these cars... everything just being swept away. Just complete panic."" The provincial minister of transportation, Rob Fleming, told a news conference it was the ""worst weather storm in a century"". Minister of public safety, Mike Farnworth, said he had ""no doubt"" that the storm was linked to climate change. Thousands of homes in British Columbia were evacuated after an ""atmospheric river"" - a long strip of moisture in the atmosphere that transports water from tropical regions towards the poles - dumped the region's monthly rainfall average in just 24 hours. An image from Nasa's worldview on Tuesday shows the extent of the flooding across the British Columbia region All 7,000 residents of Merritt, about 120 miles north-east of Vancouver, were ordered to flee their homes on Monday. Snow fell on there on Tuesday, and cars could be seen floating in icy flood waters in town. Helicopter crews were also sent to the town of Agassiz to rescue about 300 people who became trapped on a cut-off road. The rains and winds had largely finished by Tuesday afternoon, but several communities remained stranded. On Tuesday, officials in Abbotsford told residents to leave the Sumas Prairie and Yarrow neighbourhoods immediately as rising water levels posed ""a significant risk to life."" ""You need to leave immediately,"" Mayor Henry Braun said. ""Nothing is worth your life. Tomorrow morning may be too late."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Part of the Trans-Canada Highway, which connects Vancouver to the rest of the country, was submerged under water. A chunk of the Coquihalla Highway, which links Vancouver to the province interior, appeared to have crumbled into floodwaters. At one point the main available land route out of Vancouver was to enter the US and then return to Canada. However, re-entering Canada from the US requires a negative coronavirus test, and roads in the border state of Washington were also affected by the storm. The port of Vancouver, the largest in Canada, was forced to suspend all rail access because of the flooding and landslides, halting shipments of food, fuel and other goods. The port moves about C$550m ($440m) worth of cargo every day, according to Reuters news agency. Fuel pipelines in the area have also been turned off as a precaution. The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. The storm comes after British Columbia suffered a record high heat wave over last summer that killed more than 500 people, and wildfires that destroyed an entire town.

"Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson has said he hopes his party will try to stop the introduction of mandatory Covid-19 vaccine certificates in Northern Ireland. He described it as a ""bad policy"" and said it would be an infringement on people's freedoms. The Stormont executive will discuss the proposal by Health Minister Robin Swann's at a meeting on Wednesday. Three other ministers have already declared their support for the plan. Any ministers opposing to the idea ""need to set out very clearly what their alternative is"", said Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said the system should have been put in place when social distancing was scrapped in bars, cafes and restaurants andnightclubs reopened in Northern Ireland on 31 October. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, tweeted that she would support Mr Swann's proposal. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he had made a commitment to Mr Swann to ""work with him to find solutions"", but they ""have to be solutions that genuinely ease the pressures that our hospitals are under"".

Northern Ireland's health department has updated its COVIDCert NI app, which was introduced to allow people travelling abroad to show proof of vaccination, to include a certificate for ""domestic use"". But use of the domestic certificate is not mandatory - that will be up for discussion by the executive on Wednesday. Mr Swann has said thatministers will consider which sectors may require people to show certificatesto gain entry. The DUP's Mr Wilson said ministers from his party would ""make a proper assessment of the policy... and then make [their] decision"". He told BBC News NI: ""If you're going to have a policy which will save lives then at least make sure that it's workable. The Republic of Ireland has been using the EU's Digital Covid Certificate since July ""Make sure that it doesn't do other damage to the economy and to people's individual freedoms which can't be undone in the future. ""We have always said that any response to Covid should be a proportionate response and should take into consideration the impact that it has on people's lives and on businesses."" It was put to him that some hospitals in Northern Ireland were close to breaking point. He responded: ""There should have been much better planning to ensure that hospitals did have the capability - we are two years nearly into this (pandemic) now."" Mrs Long told BBC News NI: ""I felt that the time to [introduce mandatory vaccine certificates] was at the point when we were making additional relaxations. ""Those who are vaccinated are less likely to become seriously ill, and if they're less likely to be seriously ill they're less likely to put pressure on the health service."" Naomi Long says a mandatory vaccine passport system should have been introduced last month But she said it was important to maintain other measures for dealing with Covid-19. ""[Vaccine passports are] not going to be the one thing which sets us out and deals with the fact we have rising Covid levels in the community,"" she said. ""The thing that's most likely to do that is people taking personal responsibility."" Mrs Long said she did not support the introduction of Covid-19 passes ""when it comes to access to public services"". ""I think that would be discriminatory but I think when you're talking about areas of life which are optional it is reasonable, particularly where there is no social distancing possible,"" she added. If Covid passports are to be introduced in Northern Ireland it will not be a magic solution - they are just another piece of the jigsaw of measures designed to offer an additional ring of protection. The hard evidence is that vaccines work so more proof of individuals being vaccinated will help control an environment that's full of the virus. Think about it - if you reduce the chance of infectious people entering high-risk settings such as bars and nightclubs you reduce the risk of transmission. But it would be wrong to expect Covid certificates to solve all of our problems. It worked in the Republic of Ireland to an extent but now that the effectiveness of the vaccine is waning and more people are indoors certs there aren't just as powerful. Like social distancing, hand-washing, vaccines and boosters, Covid certificates are just another part of the armoury. With infection figures rising, the Department of Health needs all the ammunition it can get its hands on as it continues to battle the virus. Ms Mallon said the introduction of Covid-19 vaccine passports was ""long overdue"". ""It really is the right and responsible thing and I hope that all of the executive can examine the evidence and we can agree this and we can get moving on it extremely quickly,"" she told BBC News NI. ""No-one wants to be taking these decisions but we're in a public health emergency and so we have to take difficult unpopular decisions. Nichola Mallon says a vaccine certificate system is the ""right and responsible thing"" ""We need to do a last push, if you like, to maximise vaccine uptake and we know when you look at other places that when you incentivise it more people come forward."" Since July, people in the Republic of Ireland have had to show proof of their jabs for indoor hospitality. The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster said the majority of businesses could not support a vaccine passport. Colin Neill said that ""once again"" the industry was being singled out. ""Many are worried that this will be imposed on the sector, just because it might feel like this is the right thing to do,"" he said. He said there were many unanswered questions about what a phased approach was, what premises would be included, unvaccinated staff and the effect on jobs. ""The executive has the power to impose Covid passports but it will be the hospitality sector who will be left to carry the financial and operational burden,"" he said. ""It would appear that little or no consideration has been given to the business owners and staff who will be left to enforce the scheme."" The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, a trade body representing the sector, said Stormont must ""outline exactly what"" was required before such a policy came into effect. ""The real thing is the clarity,"" said its chief executive Janice Gault. ""The public need to know why this is being done, what is expected of them, just as businesses need to know what they are looking for and how it will be enforced.""

"This video can not be played Watch: British Columbia left devastated after storm A deadly storm described by officials as a once-in-a-century weather event has severed road and rail links around Vancouver, Canada. Two motorways connecting the West Coast city were closed after being damaged by severe flooding. Thousands of people were forced to leave their homes due to the massive storm, which struck on Sunday. A woman was killed in a highway landslide, and rescuers say at least two other people are missing. The woman's body was found near Lillooet, about 250km (155 miles) from Vancouver, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). RCMP Sgt Janelle Shoihet said that rescuers had not yet determined the number of occupied vehicles that were lost in the slide, according to AFP news agency. Motorist Kathie Rennietold CBC News,externalshe saw the landslide come down on traffic that was already at a standstill south of Lillooet. ""No sooner do we get back into our vehicles, the people that were in front of us are just screaming and running,"" she said. ""The look on their faces, it was like a tsunami was coming. It was the scariest thing that I've ever seen. ""I just turned around, and I'm just watching the whole side of the mountain coming down and taking out these cars... everything just being swept away. Just complete panic."" The provincial minister of transportation, Rob Fleming, told a news conference it was the ""worst weather storm in a century"". Minister of public safety, Mike Farnworth, said he had ""no doubt"" that the storm was linked to climate change. Thousands of homes in British Columbia were evacuated after an ""atmospheric river"" - a long strip of moisture in the atmosphere that transports water from tropical regions towards the poles - dumped the region's monthly rainfall average in just 24 hours. An image from Nasa's worldview on Tuesday shows the extent of the flooding across the British Columbia region All 7,000 residents of Merritt, about 120 miles north-east of Vancouver, were ordered to flee their homes on Monday.

"US President Joe Biden and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping met in one-on-one talks for only the second time since Mr Biden assumed the presidency in 2020 The US and China have agreed to ease travel and visa restrictions on each others' journalists. The agreement comes afterhighly-anticipated talksbetween Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. The move will allow journalists to enter and depart from both countries more freely. State media outlet China Daily said the agreement was the result of ""more than a year of difficult negotiations"". Under this, both governments will increase the validity of journalist visas from three months to one year, provided they are eligible under all applicable laws and regulations. Both countries have also pledged to allow journalists to freely depart and return, which they had previously been unable to do. The US state department spokesperson said they welcomed the moves as ""progress"" but saw them simply as ""initial steps"". They added that they would ""continue to work toward expanding access and improving conditions for US and other foreign media"". In February last year, the US decided to classify Chinese state media organisations as ""foreign missions"", which allowed for tighter control to be exercised over them. Five outlets including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network were told they would need to seek approval to buy any property, and would be required to submit lists of all employees on staff, in a move China lambasted as ""politically motivated oppression"".

"The government has announced plans to boost the UK's annual exports to Â£1 trillion by the end of the decade. The Made in the UK, Sold To The World plan is intended to help firms seize new opportunities in global markets. Last year, the UK exported about Â£600bn in goods and services. But only one in 10 British firms trades overseas. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it was ""vital"" for companies to ""unleash their full exporting potential"". As part of the 12-point plan, government agencies such as UK Export Finance will offer new services to help UK exporters to secure business. There will also be a new UK trade show programme to give UK companies help in exhibiting their products at international events. BBC global trade correspondent Chris Morris says such targets have been set before, but not achieved. But the task has acquired a new urgency, because in other rich countries, exports have recovered more quickly from coronavirus-related lockdowns. However, the context the government does not mention is Brexit, our correspondent adds. British exports worth billions face EU tariffs Post-Brexit trade: Three firms, three problems Brexit: 71 pages of paperwork for 1 lorry of fish He points out that it is much harder to export to the European Union (EU) under the UK's new free trade deal than it was in the single market. Meanwhile, the independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates exports to the EU will be about 15% lower in the long run. ""Businesses have been tackling head-on the challenges Brexit has thrown at them for the best part of five years,"" said Emma Rowland, policy adviser at the Institute of Directors. There were new opportunities across the world, but EU member states should not be overlooked, as they remained the UK's largest export markets, she said. ""While there is significant potential for trade activity in the wider world, the government must secure a pragmatic solution to the challenges of exporting to the EU,"" she added.

"Lidl has announced pay rises from March next year, which it says will make it the UK's highest-paying supermarket. It will increase its minimum pay for employees outside London to Â£10.10 an hour, with rates of up to Â£11.40 for more experienced workers. Higher rates will apply in the capital, the supermarket said. It added that the increase recognised ""the hard work and dedication of frontline colleagues during the last 18 months of the pandemic"". Earlier this year, Morrisons becamethe first UK supermarket to pay at least Â£10 an hour. ""Entry-level wages will increase from Â£9.50 to Â£10.10 an hour outside of London and Â£10.85 to Â£11.30 within the M25 from March 2022, with colleagues earning up to Â£11.40 and Â£12.25 respectively, depending on length of service,"" Lidl said. It comes afterofficial figures on Tuesdaysuggested that employers are continuing to struggle to fill roles, affecting the hospitality and retail sectors in particular. Job vacancies hit a fresh record high of 1.17 million in October - almost 400,000 higher than before the pandemic. With so many parts of the economy facing labour shortages, many employers are having to improve pay and conditions to fill vacancies and keep hold of the staff they have. Where are all the job vacancies? Lidl is still expanding. It currently has more than 850 stores in Great Britain and says it's still on track to increase that to 1,000 by the end of 2023. It clearly wants to have a competitive edge on hourly pay. And that will put pressure on its bigger rivals, who have far larger wage bills to pay for. Lidl said the move represented a pay rise of more than 6% for some. More than 21,000 Lidl employees, about 80% of its staff, would benefit, it added. By comparison,the UK's minimum wagefor workers over 23 is set to rise from its current level of Â£8.91 an hour to Â£9.50 from April 2022. And earlier this week,the Real Living Wage, paid by almost 9,000 employers throughout the country, went up from Â£9.50 to Â£9.90 an hour. How much is the minimum wage? Why is the cost of living going up? As for Lidl's rivals, the latest available data suggests Tesco and Aldi currently pay Â£9.55 an hour, while Sainsbury's, Waitrose and the Co-op pay Â£9.50 and Asda pays Â£9.18. Lidl said its latest pay rise would cost it Â£18m and described it as part of its UK investment plan. Nan Gibson, Lidl's chief HR officer, told the BBC: ""We do not expect to pass that on to customers in the form of price rises."" This video can not be played Lidl's HR boss Nan Gibson says it's ""very difficult"" to recruit staff at the moment She said it was currently ""very difficult"" to recruit staff, adding: ""We are competing for talent with all the other retailers and, indeed, other industries."" Ms Gibson said Lidl's pay rise was intended to retain existing staff ""as far as possible"", but also to attract new workers. The supermarket also reiterated its existing intention to have 1,000 stores in the UK by the end of 2023. Christian HÃ¤rtnagel, chief executive at Lidl GB, said: ""We have ambitious plans to grow our business across Great Britain, and to do that, we need to ensure we attract and look after the best talent at every level of our business.""

"This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire English cricket is ""institutionally"" racist, says former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq. Rafiq, 30, told a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time at Yorkshire. In an emotional testimony, he also said the club gave him ""inhuman"" treatment after his son was still-born in 2017. He added the issues he faced at Yorkshire are ""without a shadow of a doubt"" widespread in domestic cricket. Reaction & all the evidence: Rafiq appears before MPs Rafiq said he had lost his career to racism, which is a ""horrible feeling"" but that ""hopefully"" by speaking out there will be ""massive change in five years' time"". ""All I wanted was an acceptance, an apology, an understanding, and let's try and work together to ensure it never happens again,"" he continued. ""I was not going to let this go, no matter how much damage it causes me - I was determined to become a voice for the voiceless."" In wide-ranging testimony, Rafiq also said: All he ever wanted to do was realise his ""dream"" of playing for England Racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire The use of such terms was racist and not ""banter"" as the report had concluded It left him feeling ""isolated"" and ""humiliated"", with racist comments made by others in front of team-mates and coaching staff but not challenged The use of such language was so common it ""became the norm"" and people at the club ""didn't think it was wrong"" He ""didn't realise"" and was ""in denial"" about the scale of the problem during most of his first spell at Yorkshire, up until 2014 He thought ""things had changed"" when he returned for his second spell in 2016 But the atmosphere became ""toxic"" after Gary Ballance took over as captain later that year, shortly after former batter Andrew Gale replaced Jason Gillespie as head coach Aged 15 and a practising Muslim, he was pinned down by a senior player at his local cricket club and red wine was poured into his mouth He said he did not drink alcohol again until ""around 2012"" when he felt he had to ""to fit in"" at Yorkshire Asked about claims he had been a ""heavy drinker"", he said he ""wasn't perfect"" and was ""not proud"" of some of the things he did during this time, but that these had ""no relation"" to the racism he was subjected to The report into his allegations was ""shoddy at best"" and the panel failed to speak to key witnesses Rafiq was giving evidence to MPs after a report found he was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club said they would not discipline anyone. Yorkshire's former chairman Roger Hutton subsequently addressed the committee, followed by representatives from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), including chief executive Tom Harrison. Hutton, who offered his ""profound apologies"" to Rafiq, said Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon and former chief executive Mark Arthur ""failed to accept the gravity of the situation"". ""They have not wanted to apologise or take the recommendations of the panel going forward,"" he added. When asked by Damian Green MP if he thought cricket was institutionally racist, Rafiq replied: ""Yes, I do."" In response to a question by Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS select committee, on whether the issues he faced were ""replicated"" at other counties, Rafiq said: ""It's a problem up and down the country."" Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave alleged they received racist abuse while at the club. Essex are facing racism allegations and encouraging those that have experienced discrimination to come forward. Last weekEssex chairman John Faragher resignedfollowing an allegation he used racist language in a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Former Essex playersZoheb SharifandMaurice Chambershave both alleged they suffered racist abuse at the club. Rafiq said the scale of the problem is ""scary"" and there have been ""denials, briefings, cover-ups, smearing"". He claimed that British Asian representation in professional cricket since 2010 had dropped nearly 40% and that England have missed out on ""a hell of a lot of talent"" because Asian and black cricketers have been subjected to racism. Rafiq also called on the ECB ""to make tangible change"". Anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said Rafiq's testimony was ""heartbreaking"" to watch. ""What is most troubling is that what Azeem Rafiq has experienced is not an isolated incident, in cricket or across sport more generally,"" he added. ""Azeem Rafiq's bravery in speaking out against those who abused him needs to be a turning point - this is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with Azeem and run racism out of sport, once and for all."" Yorkshire chairman Lord Patel said it was an ""incredibly difficult day"" for all at the club and that Rafiq's testimony was ""harrowing and upsetting"". He added: ""There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on."" This video can not be played 'It sounds like the Wild West' - MP Julie Elliott on ECB regulatory process Rafiq said he was subjected to ""inhuman"" treatment after the death of his son, because the club were ""blinded"" to how they should treat him after he raised a complaint about former England player Tim Bresnan in 2017. Rafiq said that the day after his son died, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen Moxon use when addressing anyone else at the club. He said he was part of a group of ""six or seven"" players who complained about Bresnan, who now plays for Warwickshire, after which he said the club saw him as a ""trouble-maker"". He added he was the only player of colour in that group and was ""the only one to get repercussions"". Rafiq added that head coach Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. At the end of his session, Rafiq said his wife ""has struggled and still continues"" to and that his two young children ""have not had a dad, really, because all I have been worried about is Yorkshire going out to discredit me and how I am going to deal with it"". He added: ""It has been challenging, but I hope today provides some sort of closure and I can treat her for what she deserves."" Warwickshire said the report includes allegations of bullying against Rafiq by Bresnan regarding comments Bresnan made about Rafiq's weight. They said: ""We have spoken to Tim about this and he admits making such a comment. We understand there was no substantiated suggestion of racism against Tim, but he is devastated to learn of the impact of his comments."" Bresnan responded in a statement, stating: ""I have been made aware of the bullying claims made against me and have listened to Azeem Rafiq's account of his time at Yorkshire CCC today with great distress, as I'm sure everyone will have done. ""For any part I played in contributing to Azeem Rafiq's experience of feeling bullied at Yorkshire, I apologise unreservedly."" Gale is currently suspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon is currently absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"" and Yorkshire said he ""will be given the necessary support"". BBC Sport is approaching Gale for comment. Yorkshire batter Ballance, who played 23 Tests for England, said earlier this month he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq, who he regarded as his ""best mate in cricket"". Rafiq said he became friends with Zimbabwe-born Ballance when he joined Yorkshire from Derbyshire in 2008 because he felt he was an ""outsider"" as well and that others called Ballance ""things that were out of order"". But he added their relationship ""started to deteriorate"" around 2013 because of Ballance's ""conduct"" and that his ""behaviour was so disgusting"" Rafiq raised it with an agent they shared. Rafiq said they remained ""amicable"" but not close afterwards and that Ballance found the captaincy a ""real struggle"" in 2017, resulting in a ""toxic"" dressing room. He added that Ballance used the name 'Kevin' as a ""derogatory"" term to refer to any player of colour and this was an ""open secret"", including within the England dressing room. Rafiq said that England batter Alex Hales named his dog Kevin ""because it's black"". ""It's disgusting how much of a joke it was,"" said Rafiq. He added that India batter Cheteshwar Pujara was called 'Steve' by coaches, players and the Yorkshire website after bowler Jack Brooks, who now plays for Somerset, started calling Pujara that because he could not pronounce his first name. Pujara said he did not like being called Steve and wouldprefer his team-mates to call him Cheteshwar.,external BBC Sport is approaching Hales and Brooks for comment. Somerset said they ""take a zero-tolerance approach to any form of behaviour which is anything other than inclusive for all, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or any other characteristic"". They added: ""Any case reported will be thoroughly investigated as it is important that we learn lessons from the past and we welcome any information on incidents that may have occurred to help us do so."" More on Ballance's previous response to this story Rafiq alleges former England captain and BBC cricket pundit Michael Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other Asian players in 2009 while they were all at Yorkshire. England bowler Adil Rashid and former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan have corroborated the allegation, whichVaughan ""completely and categorically denies"". ""It's important on Michael that we don't make it all about Michael,"" said Rafiq. ""It was a long time ago. He might not remember it because it doesn't mean anything to him."" England Test captain Joe Root said the Yorkshire racism scandal has ""fractured our game and torn lives apart"" but thathe could not recall any instance of racismduring his time at the club. Rafiq said Root has never used racist language but he found his statement ""hurtful"" because Root was Ballance's housemate and was on nights out when racist language directed at his Pakistan heritage was used. ""Joe might not remember it but that shows just how normal it was - even a good man like him can't see it for what it is,"" he said. ""The environment and institution is the problem."" Rafiq said that following an interview on Sky, former England bowler and Yorkshire team-mate Matthew Hoggard called him and said ""I am sorry if some of the comments made you feel how you described it"". Rafiq said he thanked Hoggard for his apology and really appreciated it. BBC Sport is approaching Hoggard for comment. Rafiq also said that Sky Sports commentator David Lloyd, a former Lancashire captain and England player and later coach, had made disparaging comments about Asian cricketers after Rafiq spoke about his experiences on television. He said there were ""high-profile"" media people ""messaging other members of the media who have supported me, saying stuff like: 'Well, a clubhouse is the lifeblood of a club, and Asian players don't go in there.'"" Rafiq subsequently identified that person as Lloyd. In response, Lloyd said he had ""made some comments about the Asian cricket community"" and that he ""deeply regrets"" his actions. ""I apologise most sincerely to Azeem and to the Asian community for doing this, and for any offence caused,"" he added. Sky said in a statement it was ""investigating the comments"" attributed to Lloyd and that it was ""committed to actively championing inclusion in cricket - and in all sports - and opposing all forms of discrimination"". Rafiq first spoke out last year, claiming ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire left him close to taking his own life. Seven of the 43 allegations were upheld by an independent panel last month and the report found he had been a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at the club. However, Yorkshire said they will not take disciplinary action against any player, employee or executive. Hutton and Arthur have subsequently resigned, with Hutton's replacement as chairman, Lord Patel, apologising ""unreservedly"" and settling the employment tribunal with Rafiq. Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting international matches by the ECB. Kit supplier Nike, plus several of Yorkshire's sponsors, including Emerald Publishing, Yorkshire Tea, Tetley's beer and leisure club operators David Lloyd, either ended partnerships or said they would not continue deals. BBC Sport is approaching Yorkshire for further comment in response to today's evidence.

"MPs have backed government plans to prevent them taking on certain jobs in addition to their work in Parliament. Boris Johnson made a surprise announcement on the proposals on Tuesday amid sleaze allegations about Conservative MPs. Labour has been calling for a ban for sometime and tried to get MPs to back its plan which it said was tougher. But the government ordered its MPs to vote against the party's motion, defeating it by 51 votes. Under the government's plan any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. This is yet to be defined, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested 15 hours a week as a reasonable limit. PM follows Labour call to ban MP paid adviser jobs Johnson forced to act in sleaze row Which MPs have second jobs? In a statement after the vote, the government said MPs had backed updating the code of conduct for MPs. ""This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents,"" it said. ""This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this."" But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had provided ""warm words"" instead of a ""plan of action"". His party wanted the standards committee to draw up new rules by 31 January to implement the ban on MPs working as political consultants. And if the government did not then offer MPs a vote on these rules within 15 days, backbench MPs would gain the power to force one. Under the government's plan, the committee would come up with recommendations by the same date, but steps for implementing the recommendations are not set out. Labour ordered its MPs not to take part in the vote on the government's amendment, meaning it was passed by 297 to zero. On Wednesday night, MPs did vote to tighten up the rules on what they are allowed to do to earn money on the side. Or, at least, that when there are precise proposals, they will make decisions on it, at some not entirely precise date in the future... No 10 hopes that it will be the end - or at least the beginning of the end - of the self-inflicted fortnight of bad headlines and claims of sleaze that have come, day after day after day. And, with that, allow the government to move on to make noise about what they are trying to get done, rather than the things that are going wrong. Will they get their way? Read more from Laura The vote comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson again admitted it had been a ""mistake"" to try and overhaul the standards system at the same time as potentially saving Owen Paterson from punishment for breaking the existing rules on second jobs. But the PM stopped short of apologising for the debacle, during a grilling by select committee chairs at the Commons Liaison Committee. However, at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson told his MPs he had ""crashed the car"" in the way he had handled Mr Paterson's disciplinary case. Earlier, he was involved infurious exchanges with Sir Keir Starmerat Prime Minister's Questions, with the Labour leader branding him a ""coward"" over his stance on second jobs. In the debate on second job rules, called by Labour, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was important for MPs to ""maintain connections to the world beyond so that we may draw on the insight and expertise that this experience offers"". But he added that MPs ""should not be for sale"", saying: ""We are elected to Parliament on a promise to work for the greater good, not ourselves."" Labour MPs dismissed the argument that MPs need to be allowed to do extra work for real world experience, arguing that being an MP is a full time job. The party's shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, said: ""There should be no MP taking money to be a political strategist, an assistant or some sort of corporate adviser. That should not happen."" Owen Paterson, who has resigned as an MP, denies breaking Commons lobbying rules Arguments over second jobs held by MPs outside of Westminster have intensified in recent weeks in the wake of the Mr Paterson's case. The Conservative MP was found to have broken Commons rules by using his position to lobby for two companies paying him. The government tried to block his suspension from Parliament and get the whole disciplinary process for MPs reviewed. But it abandoned the plan a day later, after an outcry from opposition MPs and some Tories. Mr Paterson then resigned as an MP. Appearing in front of the Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said he believed the MP had broken the rules, saying it was ""extraordinary"" that some of his colleagues ""behave in these ways"". There's nothing to stop MPs - other than ministers - doing extra work on top of the job they were elected to do. The rules do not prohibit them earning money - in addition to their Â£81,932 salary - or gaining greater experience of the world beyond Westminster. So, MPs can continue to work in professions like the law or medicine. Or they can work as consultants for companies, offering advice on strategy. But they must not lobby - try to alter government policy - for firms, individuals or organisations who pay them, or use Commons facilities to do work on behalf of employers or clients. MPs have to register their outside earnings and if they take part in a debate or other parliamentary activities in which their employer/client is involved, they have to declare an interest. Any breaches of Parliament's code of conduct can result in punishment, including a suspension from the Commons.
