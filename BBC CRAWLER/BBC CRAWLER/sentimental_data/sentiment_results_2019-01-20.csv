"Prince Philip driving the replacement Land Rover Freelander on Saturday Norfolk Police say they have spoken to the Duke of Edinburgh after he was pictured driving without a seat belt, 48 hours after being involved in a crash near Sandringham in Norfolk. A spokeswoman said ""suitable words of advice have been given to the driver"". Meanwhile, Emma Fairweather, who broke her wrist in the crash,has told the Mirror,externalthe duke has not apologised. A Palace spokesman has said contact was made with the occupants of the car to exchange ""well-wishes"". The crash on the A149, in which Prince Philip's Land Rover Freelander landed on its side after a collision with a Kia, happened on Thursday. Speed limit cut on duke crash A-road Is age a factor behind the wheel? Two days later, pictures in theDaily Mail,externalandthe Sun,externalappeared to show the duke, 97, driving alone on a road near the entrance to the Sandringham estate in a replacement Freelander, without a seat belt. A spokeswoman for the Norfolk Constabulary said the force was aware of the photographs and had spoken to the driver. ""This is in line with our standard response when being made aware of such images showing this type of offence,"" she said. The force said earlier it was standard policy to breath test drivers involved in collisions and both had provided negative readings. On Sunday morning, well-wishers concerned for the duke were among those welcoming the Queen at a church service on her Sandringham Estate. Jane Watson, who travelled to St Peter's Church with a group of friends from Northamptonshire, called the duke ""a role model for a lot of people"". Adding: ""At his age he should be more careful as he was putting himself and other people at risk."" The prince, who had not attended services during the festive period, was not at the Queen's side.

""It has been such a traumatic and painful time and I would have expected more of the Royal Family,"" she added. She said she had not heard from the royal household but had got a call from a police family liaison officer. ""The message he passed on didn't even make sense. He said, 'The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh would like to be remembered to you,'"" she said. ""That's not an apology or even a well-wish."" Buckingham Palace said on Saturday that a ""full message of support was sent to both the driver and the passenger"".

"Jan Siewert (left) and Martin Warhurst A Manchester City fan from Wakefield has spoken of his surprise - after he was asked by a TV reporter whether he was becoming the new manager of Huddersfield Town Football Club. Martin Warhurst was in the crowd for the Premier League game at Huddersfield when cameras zoomed in on him, in the belief that he was Jan Siewert. A Sky reporter was shown - although not heard - asking Mr Warhurst if he was the new German manager. He said: ""I'm Martin from Wakefield."" Siewert, a coach at German team Borussia Dortmund, has been tippedto take over the job of managing Huddersfield. Charity boss Martin Warhurst had to deny suggestions he was set to become a Premier League manager Mr Warhurst told the Press Association: ""It was bizarre. Basically what happened is I was sat in the crowd and suddenly I was aware of a guy coming towards me from the right hand side. ""He said 'Are you Jan, the new manager?' I laughed and said: 'No, no, that's not me. I'm Martin from Wakefield'."" He added: ""That was all I heard of it and then suddenly everybody's phones and my phone started going crazy, saying 'I've just seen you on telly'. ""There was lots of reaction from people in the crowd - just people coming up and having selfies and people patting me on the back and wishing me luck."" Huddersfield make Siewert enquiry 'I'm not a stripper' and other mistakes Mr Warhurst acknowledged his likeness with Siewert but joked: ""I'm a much more attractive guy."" He added that he would follow the progress of his ""doppelganger"" and even offered some footballing wisdom. ""My tip, if I were the Huddersfield manager playing against a team like Manchester City, I think if they played a formation of 5-5-5 they might actually stand a chance!"" Manchester Citywon the game against Huddersfield 3-0. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"An abandoned boat was found on Folkestone's Warren beach Sixteen migrants have been detained after crossing the Channel to Kent in three boats. An inflatable dinghy with six men landed on a beach at Kingsdown, near Walmer, at about 07:00 GMT. Just over an hour later, Border Force officers were called to an abandoned boat on Folkestone's Warren beach, and two men were detained in the town. At about 09:35, a dinghy containing eight men was intercepted off the coast and escorted into Dover. The Home Office said most of the migrants presented themselves as Iranian, with others saying they were from Iraq. They received a medical assessment before being transferred to immigration officials for interview. Rob Bewick said he saw one of the inflatable boats while walking on the beach between Folkestone and Dover. ""A number of coastguard officials were stood around but there was also someone from UK Border Force,"" said Mr Bewick, from Folkestone. """"There weren't any people there - it looked as though the boat had been abandoned."" Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies?

Over the course of the week riot police have clashed with protesters in the capital, Harare, and the southern city of Bulawayo after they lit fires and blocked roads using rocks.

"Frazer Mackay may have saved the young thornback ray A young thornback ray has been saved at Macduff Marine Aquarium in Aberdeenshire - after being allowed to grow in a sandwich bag. The ray was trapped in its egg case - known as a mermaid's purse - and would have died. Aquarium employee Frazer Mackay peeled open the case and put the ray, still at the embryo stage, in the bag. The ray is now a month old and the aquarium said it is ""thriving"" in the sandwich bag in a quarantine tank. Mr Mackay said: ""This one's been quite lucky. I actually found it while I was clearing out the tank. ""All the others had hatched and I was removing the empty egg cases. ""I picked up this one and I gave it a bit of a squish to get all the air out, and it didn't squish so I peeled it open and saw there was still a baby ray inside it. The purse was closed so I assumed it was empty."" He added: ""I peeled it out from the egg case and passed it into the poly pocket and it started wriggling and doing its thing - and it was actually alive which was big sigh of relief.""

"This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? US President Donald Trump has attacked Democrats for rejecting his proposals to end the longest government shutdown in US history. He said his plans had been dismissed before he had even presented them. Mr Trump had offered ""compromises"" in exchange for funding for his security wall along the Mexican border, the issue that has caused the shutdown. But Democrats called the proposals ""unacceptable"", a ""non-starter"" and ""hostage taking"". Why has the US government shut down? Six ways the US shutdown ends US shutdown: Workers crowdfund to survive There were two main offers in an address Mr Trump made on Saturday: Some 700,000 so-called Dreamers, who were young when they entered the US illegally with their parents, would be protected for another three years Some 300,000 people holding visas under Temporary Protection Status (TPS) would also get three years' protection. These are people who have fled countries affected by war or disasters On Twitter, he said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats had ""turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak"". He said his opponents ""don't see crime and drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win"". How much of Trump's wall has been built? Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting How will history judge President Trump? A second tweet appeared aimed at the conservative right, which fears the offer he made on immigration would amount to an amnesty. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall He tweeted: ""No. Amnesty is not part of my offer."" He said he was only talking about a three-year extension and that an amnesty would ""be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else"". Mr Trump also said he was not planning a ""big push to remove 11 million plus people"" in the US illegally, but added a warning to Ms Pelosi to ""be careful"" on that. The target of Mr Trump's anger wasa statement released by Ms Pelosi,externalanticipating - and rejecting - the concessions before they were made. She said the proposals were ""a non-starter"" and ""a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives"". This video can not be played Dreamers: ""America is the only country I've known"" Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump had previously ""single-handedly"" taken away Dreamer and TPS protections and that offering some protections back was ""not a compromise but more hostage taking"". The Democrats insist they will not negotiate until government is reopened. The party took over control of the House this year, while Mr Trump's Republicans still have a majority in the Senate. The federal budget funding would have to be agreed by both. Opinion polls suggest most Americans blame Mr Trump more than the Democrats for the shutdown. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump struck a deal to reopen the government and build his much-promised wall - with one small problem. He was negotiating with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and if he wants to succeed he's going to have to get Democrats on board. It's a touch ironic that the deal Mr Trump outlined - his wall in exchange for protection for certain childhood undocumented migrants and temporary resident aliens - was one the president walked away from last year, when Democrats were the ones instigating a shutdown. After senators thought they had an agreement, the White House issued new demands for reforms to legal immigration. Now Democrats are in control of the House, and the calculus has changed. Mr Trump's offer of temporary immigrant protection probably isn't any greater than the ones courts have already imposed. The president's move may put some pressure on his opponents to return to the negotiating table, but they still feel they have the upper hand. Unless that changes - or the president backs down - the shutdown will drag on. Some of the 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December are in increasingly dire straits as the shutdown enters its fifth week. This video can not be played Federal workers queue up for free food More than 1,500 appeals have been set up by them on crowdfunding site GoFundMe, seeking a financial lifeline to pay rent or feed and clothe their children.

The fire started before dawn on Sunday in a building housing seasonal workers. In all, three buildings were affected. Seventy firefighters battled to bring the blaze under control. The cause has not yet been confirmed. Footage from the scene shows fire crews using ladders to try to rescue people from inside the three-storey building. One video, posted on social media, shows at least one person jumping from an upper floor window in an attempt to escape the blaze. Another clip appears to show dozens of people gathered in the street below after being evacuated from the building.

Three of the four seriously injured were taken to hospital by helicopter, local officials said. They added that some of those caught up in the tragedy were probably sleeping when the fire broke out. It took emergency crews several hours to control the blaze. The accommodation at the centre of the fire was situated above a Chanel retail store. FrÃ©dÃ©ric Loiseau, a local government official, told French broadcaster BFMTV that the identities of those killed had not yet been established. ""In the case of those seriously injured, it's impossible to specify whether their injuries came from a fall. Because the fire was on the third floor, some people jumped to save their lives,"" he said. ""There were carbon monoxide emissions, and there were burns."" He added that local prosecutors and police investigators, who had cordoned off the area, would now launch an investigation into what started the fire. The wooden panels of three-storey building's exterior were charred in the fire Images of the aftermath showed external areas of the upper floors of the buildings blackened by smoke and flames. Christophe Castaner, France's Interior minister, tweeted his condolences to the victims' loved ones and paid tribute to the firefighters. Video shows fatal ski resort fire.

"This video can not be played Police guarding the parliament building in Athens clashed with opponents of the Macedonia renaming plan Protesters have clashed with police in the Greek capital Athens at a big rally to oppose the government's deal with Macedonia on changing its name. Police fired tear gas at some of those attending a protest which attracted tens of thousands to the city. The deal, which is yet to be approved, designates Greece's northern neighbour as Republic of North Macedonia. The name Macedonia is sensitive for many Greeks who say it implies a claim on the Greek province of the same name. Years of wrangling finally brought an agreement last June between Greece's left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart. A vote on the deal, which aims to end a 28-year row between the nations, is set to take place in the Greek parliament this week. The dispute dates back to 1991 and the break-up of Yugoslavia. Macedonia was a Yugoslav republic and adopted the name Macedonia when it became an independent nation. Greece has long argued the use of the name implied a territorial claim and cultural appropriation. At the UN the country was formally known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom). Earlier this monthMacedonia ratified the deal on the name change to the Republic of North Macedonia. Mr Tsipras has faced sharp opposition over the plan Greek opposition figures argue Mr Tsipras has made too many concessions. Full story: What's in a name? The man who has focused on one word for years Last week he narrowly survived a vote of no confidence after his junior coalition partner withdrew support. Some members of the Greek parliament have received death threats intended to influence their vote. Organisers had said as many as 600,000 people were expected to take part in Sunday's demonstrations. The actual numbers fell far short - with police estimating 60,000 in the capital at 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT). The protests attracted a wide range of participants People had travelled from across the country to demonstrate close to the national parliament. Demonstrators in the capital on Sunday chanted, ""Macedonia is Greek"" and waved Greek flags. A number of clerics, dressed in black, were among those taking part. Macedonia country profile Greece country profile Why the row over Macedonia runs so deep ""We cannot stomach this deal, to give away our Macedonia, our history,"" a 67-year-old protester at the scene, Amalia Savrami, told Reuters. There were scenes of confrontation in places At one point, scuffles broke out near parliament when masked demonstrators threw stones and fireworks at police. Police blocked gas-mask-wearing protesters from storming steps leading to parliament. A highway was also temporarily blocked in northern Greece in solidarity with the protesters, reports say. Many Greeks argue that the name Macedonia can only refer to the Greek province of the same name. The dispute has led to Greece to blocking Macedonia's hopes of joining Nato and the European Union. Greece resumes Macedonia flights The makeover that's divided a nation Under the deal, the country's language would be Macedonian and its people known as Macedonians (citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia). The move has met with sharp resistance in both countries because nationalists believe it erodes their identity.

HMV owner Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, has blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges for the latest collapse, including business rate levels and the increasing use of streaming services to deliver music and movies. When the chain fell into administration last month, Paul McGowan, executive chairman of HMV and Hilco, said HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. However, he added that the industry consensus was that the market would fall by another 17% during 2019. HMV's stores are continuing to trade while negotiations are held with major suppliers and bids are considered. HMV's Croydon branch is closing down this week because of redevelopment Besides Mr Ashley's bid, KPMG has said it has received ""a number of offers on various bases"". ""We now need to evaluate these further over the coming days,"" it added. After establishing Sports Direct in 1982, Mr Ashley built his business by buying up well-known names such as Dunlop, Slazenger, outdoor gear specialist Karrimor and the boxing brand Lonsdale. After many years of growth and the demise of rivals such as JJB Sports, it is now the UK's largest sportswear retailer, with more than 400 stores including Lillywhites in London's Piccadilly. Sports Direct also owns a stake in Game Digital, which Mr Ashley could merge with HMV if he is successful,according to Sky News, who first reported Mr Ashley's interest in buying HMV,external. KPMG set a deadline of last Tuesday for bids for the stores, but has not named any bidders. There is said to be no deadline for a decision.

"This video can not be played Thirty-four Holocaust survivors accompanied the casket to the burial site The UK's Chief Rabbi has urged an end to rising anti-Semitism, at a funeral for six unknown Auschwitz victims whose remains were donated to a museum. Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said hate speech ""can easily be translated into hate crime"" and the service was a reminder to confront all forms of racism. The remains of five adults and one child were anonymously donated to the Imperial War Museum in 1997. The unknown victims were buried with earth from Israel. Rabbi Mirvis warned: ""When anti-Semitism is allowed to thrive, some people can do anything and some people can reach the lowest end of human conduct."" Many of the 1,000 people attending the service at Bushey New Cemetery, Hertfordshire, were moved to tears during the service. They included survivors and relatives of victims who were murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols. The donated remains were buried with earth from Israel Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, the Israeli ambassador and the deputy German ambassador were also there. After the ceremony, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must continue to challenge racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry and where hatred can lead."" The MP also said he hoped the funeral would bring people together and underline the message of ""never again, never forget and that none of us can simply stand by the side and allow this to happen"". At least six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis and their allies during World War Two, Many were starved and gassed to death, and their remains incinerated, including more than a million men women and children who were murdered in the Auschwitz death camp in German-occupied Poland. What was the Holocaust? Israel in Danube Holocaust victim search The human remains were among a large number of objects relating to the Holocaust given to the museum by a donor. They are understood to have been removed during a visit to the Auschwitz site several decades ago. The Imperial War Museum (IWM) has a license to hold such items and the remains have been kept in storage for two decades. The leader of the Holocaust Galleries at the IWM, James Bulgin, said: ""The museum receives thousands of objects, but something like this is unusual to the point of complete uniqueness. ""Hundreds of thousands of people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Anybody who lost a relative there can consider these remains and think they could belong to my grandfather or mother."" Mr Bulgin described the process of discovering details about the remains as ""difficult"", adding: ""These remains are fragments and also ash, and some of that can't be analysed further."" Through forensic analysis the museum was able to find out that the fragments were the human remains of adults and children. But because the process is limited, ages, gender or other personal details remain unknown. In his address, Rabbi Mirvis addressed the six victims. He said: ""We don't know who you are, we don't know if you're male or female, we don't know which country you're from, but one thing we do know; you were Jewish and brutally murdered. ""You were let down badly at the time and now your remains have somehow come to the UK. And we have the opportunity of granting you the dignity and honour of a funeral service."" About 1,000 people attended the service in Hertfordshire Previously Rabbi Mirvis said the symbolism of the funeral service was enormous. ""We find exceptional poignancy in the fact that there are six souls that we are burying,"" he said. ""Each one stands for one million souls who perished. And interestingly enough there were just under five million who were adults and just over one million who were children."" Rabbi Mirvis added: ""There were members of my family who perished in the Holocaust and we all related to this directly. Now we will have the opportunity to accord them some dignity and to give them a final resting place."" He said he hoped the site would become a place of pilgrimage for Jewish families, much like the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. But he also reflected on the memorial's timeliness for wider society, adding: ""We need a strong reminder such as this to let us know what can result, even within a democratic society, what can result if anti-Semitism, if racism and xenophobia, go unchecked."" The Prince of Wales, who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, has sent a letter of condolence to the Jewish community.

"Footage of a group of teenagers - many wearing Make America Great Again caps - taunting a Native American man in Washington DC has drawn criticism. The teenagers, students at Kentucky's Covington Catholic High School, are seen mocking Omaha elder Nathan Phillips as he sings and drums. The students were taking part in an anti-abortion rally on Friday, while Mr Phillips came for an Indigenous Peoples' March. The school apologised to Mr Phillips.

The Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School later issued a statement offering ""our deepest apologies to Mr Phillips"". ""We condemn the actions of the Covington Catholic High School students,externaltowards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general,"" the statement reads. It added that the incident was being investigated and ""appropriate action"" would be taken. The teens are seen mocking Mr Phillips and his companion, as the two men sing the American Indian Movement song. One boy, in particular, is captured staring at Mr Phillips while many other students are heard mockingly singing the song. In separate footage later shared on social media, Mr Phillips is seen approaching the boys as he sings. After the incident, Mr Phillips was quoted by US media as saying: ""I heard them saying 'build that wall, build that wall'"". ""This is indigenous land: you're not supposed to have walls here. ""We never had a prison; we always took care of our elders, took care of our children, always provided for them, taught them right from wrong. ""I wish I could... put that energy to making this country really, really great,"" Mr Phillips said. Correction 25 January 2019: In subsequent US media interviews Mr Phillips said that while he had served in the Marine reserves, he was never deployed to Vietnam and so we have removed references describing him as a Vietnam veteran. Update 29 January 2019: One of the students shown in the footage, Nick Sandmann, subsequently disputed Mr Phillips' account of the incident, as additional video footage from the day emerged.

"Tony Mendez was a specialist in disguises and forgeries at the CIA Ex-CIA agent Tony Mendez, who inspired the Oscar-winning film Argo, has died at the age of 78. He had been suffering from Parkinson's Disease. At the CIA, Mendez specialised in disguises, forgery and rescues. He is best known for smuggling six American diplomats out of Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis by posing as a film producer. Ben Affleck, who directed Argo and starred as Mendez, called him ""a true American hero"". ""He was a man of extraordinary grace, decency, humility and kindness,"" Affleck said in a tweet.

Tony Mendez, the real CIA spy in Argo Argo: The true story behind Ben Affleck's Globe-winning film Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell also tweeted that Mendez ""was one of the best officers to ever serve at CIA"". ""His work was unique, and it help [sic] to protect our nation in significant ways."" Mendez's literary agent, Christy Fetcher, said: ""He was surrounded with love from his family and will be sorely missed."" Born in 1940, Mendez worked as a draughtsman after graduating from university and joined the CIA after answering a blind advert for a graphic artist. Over a 25-year career he worked with Hollywood make-up artists and magicians to perfect disguises and fake identities. He served in multiple foreign posts, mostly in Asia. In 1980 he orchestrated what would later be called the ""Canadian Caper"", a daring rescue of six American diplomats from Iran. The diplomats were forced to shelter in Canada's embassy in Tehran after protesters overran the American embassy. Mendez met the six and helped them to pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a non-existent sci-fi movie, Argo. With Canada's help, the group was able to evade Iranian security services and board a flight to Zurich from Tehran. After retiring from the CIA, Mendez ran an art studio and wrote three memoirs about his experiences.

"An abandoned boat was found on Folkestone's Warren beach Sixteen migrants have been detained after crossing the Channel to Kent in three boats. An inflatable dinghy with six men landed on a beach at Kingsdown, near Walmer, at about 07:00 GMT. Just over an hour later, Border Force officers were called to an abandoned boat on Folkestone's Warren beach, and two men were detained in the town. At about 09:35, a dinghy containing eight men was intercepted off the coast and escorted into Dover. The Home Office said most of the migrants presented themselves as Iranian, with others saying they were from Iraq. They received a medical assessment before being transferred to immigration officials for interview. Rob Bewick said he saw one of the inflatable boats while walking on the beach between Folkestone and Dover. ""A number of coastguard officials were stood around but there was also someone from UK Border Force,"" said Mr Bewick, from Folkestone.

"This video can not be played Roger Federer beaten by Stefanos Tsitsipas in Australian Open Australian Open 2019 Venue:Melbourne ParkDates:14-27 January Coverage:Daily live commentaries on the BBC Sport website, listen to Tennis Breakfast daily from 07:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and watch highlights on BBC TV and online. Defending champion Roger Federer is out of the Australian Open after Greek 14th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas earned the biggest win of his career to reach the quarter-finals. The Swiss lost 6-7 (11-13) 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 7-6 (7-5) on a dramatic night. Federer, a six-time champion, failed to reach the last eight in Melbourne for only the second time in 16 years. Tsitsipas, 20, saved all 12 of 37-year-old Federer's break points on his way to a famous win. ""I'm the happiest man on earth right now, I can't describe it,"" he said. ""I beat my idol. My idol today became pretty much my rival."" Federer lumped a forehand long to leave Tsitsipas serving for the match in the fourth-set tie-break, and the youngster forced him into a backhand error to win in three hours and 45 minutes. Tsitsipas dropped his racquet in celebration and seemed to mouth ""me?"" at the crowd,  expressing his shock further by covering his hand with mouth, before starting to cry as he walked over to celebrate with his team. ""That moment is definitely something that I will never, ever, ever forget,"" he said. ""This match point is going to stay, I'm pretty much sure, forever, for the rest of my life."" He will play Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat Croatian sixth seed Marin Cilic in five sets, in the last eight. And the Greek believes he is on the verge of ""something big"" and could perhaps even win the tournament. ""That's why I'm here, playing to win the trophy,"" he said. ""I want it really badly."" Federer targets clay season return after Australian Open exit Federer v Tsitsipas as it happened Profile: Who is Stefanos Tsitsipas? This video can not be played Australian Open 2019: Stefanos Tsitsipas interview after win over Roger Federer Federer was aiming to win a record seventh men's singles title at Melbourne Park, moving him clear of world number one Novak Djokovic and Australian legend Roy Emerson. But the 20-time Grand Slam champion was undone by a player considered to be one of the best hopes to take over the mantle when Federer - along with Djokovic and Rafael Nadal - retires. The pair were contesting their first ATP-level match, although did meet last month in a Hopman Cup tie which Federer edged in two tie-breaks, indicating their contest in Melbourne could be equally tight. Tsitsipas' fearless and energetic approach unsettled Federer, seemingly putting doubt in the former world number one's mind on the key points. Federer failed to convert any of 12 break points, with some errant forehands particularly letting him down. ""There are always multiple factors in match like this, but it didn't go well on the set points,"" he said. ""I didn't break him at the Hopman Cup either, so something is going wrong. It is very frustrating."" Nadal beats Berdych in straight sets Kerber suffers shock loss to Collins The most significant were the eight which he could not take in a six-game spell in the second set - specifically the four which were set points in a nerve-wracking 10th game. For three consecutive service games, Tsitsipas was put under severe examination in lengthy battles which the Greek eventually came through unscathed. That enabled him to go on and level in the tie-break - a pivotal moment which turned the match in his favour. ""I could have cracked at any moment, but I didn't because I really wanted it bad,"" said Tsitsipas. ""That mental toughness helped a lot. It could have been a different match if I didn't stand that pressure."" Federer had lost his past two Grand Slam matches after dropping sets for the first time in the tournament - against Kevin Anderson at Wimbledon and John Millman at the US Open - and he suffered the same fate again. ""I lost to a better player who played very well. He stayed calm and hung in there, which is not easy for younger guys so credit to him,"" Federer added. This video can not be played 'Welcome to the future of men's tennis!' - when Tsitsipas wowed Wimbledon Tsitsipas has enjoyed a rapid rise over the past 18 months, becoming the first Greek man to reach the world's top 100 in October 2017 and then climbing to his current ranking of 15th. That transferred into trophies when he won his first ATP Tour title at the Stockholm Open last October, going on to win the NextGen Finals - the end-of-season finals for the best players aged under 21 - in December. Yet this is the landmark win at a Grand Slam which will now announce his arrival to a wider audience. It was not all about digging in on the break points, however. Tsitsipas matched Federer in a high-quality encounter, producing 61 winners - bettering the Swiss' tally by one - and succeeding in 71% of his 68 forays forward to the net. He limited his unforced errors to 38, compared to 55 from Federer which included 40 from his forehand alone. Although most fans inside Rod Laver Arena were pro-Federer, everybody watching cannot have failed to have been impressed by Tsitsipas' all-action style. ""I believe in coming into the net and being aggressive and taking the ball early, we have to keep it going,"" he said. ""Most players in this era are baseliners. I like this aggressive game, coming into the net, and serve and volleying now and again. ""It keeps the game alive and makes it much more interesting."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Melbourne Park Stefanos Tsitsipas offered Roger Federer no respite. His level never dipped, and he set the platform for a famous victory by fending off four break points and four set points to win the second set. The first signs of alarm for the Swiss came in the third set. He may have won this title for the past two years, and an eighth Wimbledon title in the months in between, but fading stamina is a fact of life even for Federer when he is playing a five set match against a man 17 years his junior. Last year, Federer did not drop a set en route to the final, but he lost in five to Kevin Anderson at Wimbledon and in four to John Millman on a brutally humid night at the US Open. Federer announced afterwards that he plans to play at this year's French Open for the first time since 2015. That will be cause for great rejoicing in Paris, but you do have to wonder what impact that will have on his chances at Wimbledon.

"BBC News' stills photographer Jeff Overs captured these views of the eclipse in Brighton, UK (montage) A lunar eclipse, which some are referring to as a ""super blood wolf moon"", has delighted skywatchers around the world. During the spectacular event, the Earth's natural satellite turns a striking shade of red. The entire eclipse was visible from North and South America, as well as parts of western Europe (including the UK) and north Africa. In pictures: 'Super blood wolf moon' This kind of eclipse occurs when the Earth passes precisely between the Sun and the Moon. In this situation, the Sun is behind the Earth, and the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. Yes. Some commentators are referring to the event as a ""super blood wolf moon"". The ""super"" part comes from the fact that the Moon will be near its closest approach to the Earth - when it will be marginally bigger in the sky than usual. The ""wolf"" part comes from the name given to full moons in January - ""wolf moons"". Walter Freeman, an assistant teaching professor at Syracuse University in New York state, said: ""A little bit of sunlight is refracted by the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the Moon, bending around the edges of the Earth. This small amount of red light still illuminates the Moon enough for us to see it."" The moon seen beside a quadriga on top of the Cinquantenaire arch in Brussels The eclipse began at 02:35 GMT on Monday and ended at 07:49 GMT, but the point of greatest eclipse occurred at 05:12 GMT. In the UK, the Moon was above the horizon throughout the eclipse, though from the extreme south-east of England the Sun had risen as the eclipse ended. This video can not be played Elizabeth Rizzini explains the ""super blood wolf moon"" - and forecasts the weather for UK skywatchers on Monday This eclipse was also visible in north-western France, north-western Spain, Portugal, a small part of west Africa, almost the whole of North and South America, the eastern Pacific, and the north-eastern tip of Russia. While solar eclipses are dangerous to view directly, the light from lunar eclipses is much fainter and so is completely safe to view without special equipment. The event was the last chance for skywatchers in the UK to see a total lunar eclipse in its entirety until 2029 - weather permitting. Penumbral eclipse begins:This starts when the outer (and lighter) part of the Earth's shadow begins moving across the Moon Partial eclipse begins:This stage takes hold when the darker, inner part of the Earth's shadow (umbra) begins covering the Moon Total eclipse begins:Also called totality, this occurs when the umbra completely covers the Moon, turning it a reddish brown colour Maximum eclipse:The mid-point of totality Total eclipse ends:The umbra starts moving away from the Moon's face after totality Partial eclipse ends:Earth's umbra completely leaves the surface of the Moon Penumbral eclipse ends:The outer part of the shadow (penumbra) completely moves away from the Moon Source: timeanddate.com New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Tony Mendez was a specialist in disguises and forgeries at the CIA Ex-CIA agent Tony Mendez, who inspired the Oscar-winning film Argo, has died at the age of 78. He had been suffering from Parkinson's Disease. At the CIA, Mendez specialised in disguises, forgery and rescues. He is best known for smuggling six American diplomats out of Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis by posing as a film producer. Ben Affleck, who directed Argo and starred as Mendez, called him ""a true American hero"". ""He was a man of extraordinary grace, decency, humility and kindness,"" Affleck said in a tweet. ""He never sought the spotlight for his actions, he merely sought to serve his country."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tony Mendez, the real CIA spy in Argo Argo: The true story behind Ben Affleck's Globe-winning film Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell also tweeted that Mendez ""was one of the best officers to ever serve at CIA"". ""His work was unique, and it help [sic] to protect our nation in significant ways."" Mendez's literary agent, Christy Fetcher, said: ""He was surrounded with love from his family and will be sorely missed."" Born in 1940, Mendez worked as a draughtsman after graduating from university and joined the CIA after answering a blind advert for a graphic artist. Over a 25-year career he worked with Hollywood make-up artists and magicians to perfect disguises and fake identities. He served in multiple foreign posts, mostly in Asia. In 1980 he orchestrated what would later be called the ""Canadian Caper"", a daring rescue of six American diplomats from Iran. The diplomats were forced to shelter in Canada's embassy in Tehran after protesters overran the American embassy. Mendez met the six and helped them to pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a non-existent sci-fi movie, Argo. With Canada's help, the group was able to evade Iranian security services and board a flight to Zurich from Tehran. After retiring from the CIA, Mendez ran an art studio and wrote three memoirs about his experiences.

"Footage of a group of teenagers - many wearing Make America Great Again caps - taunting a Native American man in Washington DC has drawn criticism. The teenagers, students at Kentucky's Covington Catholic High School, are seen mocking Omaha elder Nathan Phillips as he sings and drums. The students were taking part in an anti-abortion rally on Friday, while Mr Phillips came for an Indigenous Peoples' March. The school apologised to Mr Phillips.

The Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School later issued a statement offering ""our deepest apologies to Mr Phillips"". ""We condemn the actions of the Covington Catholic High School students,externaltowards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general,"" the statement reads. It added that the incident was being investigated and ""appropriate action"" would be taken. The teens are seen mocking Mr Phillips and his companion, as the two men sing the American Indian Movement song. One boy, in particular, is captured staring at Mr Phillips while many other students are heard mockingly singing the song. In separate footage later shared on social media, Mr Phillips is seen approaching the boys as he sings. After the incident, Mr Phillips was quoted by US media as saying: ""I heard them saying 'build that wall, build that wall'"". ""This is indigenous land: you're not supposed to have walls here. ""We never had a prison; we always took care of our elders, took care of our children, always provided for them, taught them right from wrong. ""I wish I could... put that energy to making this country really, really great,"" Mr Phillips said. Correction 25 January 2019: In subsequent US media interviews Mr Phillips said that while he had served in the Marine reserves, he was never deployed to Vietnam and so we have removed references describing him as a Vietnam veteran. Update 29 January 2019: One of the students shown in the footage, Nick Sandmann, subsequently disputed Mr Phillips' account of the incident, as additional video footage from the day emerged.

"Former Assistant Chief Constable Steve Watts said prosecutors decided not to proceed with the case There is ""strong"" evidence to bring criminal charges after the deaths of hundreds of patients at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, the detective who led an investigation believes. An inquiry in June last year found more than 450 patients died after being given ""dangerous"" levels of drugs. Dr Jane Barton, the GP at the centre of the scandal, prescribed strong opioid painkillers to elderly patients. Hampshire Constabulary previously investigated the hospital three times. No charges have ever been brought. Many patients who died had been sent to the hospital to recover from operations. Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 Former Assistant Chief Constable Steve Watts, who led the third and largest investigation into 94 deaths, told BBC Panorama he believes the evidence was enough to take the case to court. ""I think it's strong enough now, I think it was strong enough then, and I think there was an overriding public interest in doing so,"" he said. During the investigations, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) looked at possible charges of manslaughter and murder in relation to Dr Barton and some nurses who administered the drugs. However, prosecutors decided there was not a reasonable chance of securing convictions. Mr Watts said: ""I knew what the response of the families was going to be, I knew what the response of the public was going to be and I recall talking to the prosecutors and saying that this will end up in a public inquiry and eventually I think the matter will go before a court."" More than 450 patients died after being given painkilling drugs at Gosport War Memorial Hospital Police in Hampshire handed the case over to their colleagues in Kent and Essex who are now reviewing the evidence to decide if a fourth police investigation is necessary. BBC Panorama has examined witness statements given to the earlier police investigations by nurses working inside the hospital. They told police they thought diamorphine, delivered continuously to patients by a syringe driver, did shorten patients' lives. One auxiliary nurse said: ""It got to the stage that every time Dr Barton came to the annexe, I would think to myself who's going to die now?"" In another statement, a staff nurse said: ""It seemed that most patients were going on drivers even when they were not in pain."" Another nurse said they believed the drug was used ""to keep the waiting lists down"". Dr Barton was found guilty of serious professional misconduct in 2010 but no prosecutions were brought However, former nurse Sheelagh Joines, who was sister on Gosport's Daedalus Ward between 1993 and 1997, disagreed. ""As far as I am concerned Dr Barton didn't shorten any lives on my ward,"" she said. ""They were nursed to the best of my ability and they had what every patient is entitled to - peaceful, pain-free, dignity - and I mean dignified death."" She added at one stage the ward felt like a ""dumping ground"". ""They were sent to us and we were hoping we could rehabilitate them which we tried. ""But it soon became apparent they were nursing care, and they had damn good nursing care, but they weren't rehabilitation."" New police probe into hospital deaths Gosport: The numbers behind the scandal Jane Barton, the doctor who shortened lives Dr Barton, who declined to comment, was disciplined by the General Medical Council in 2010 for serious professional misconduct, but she was not struck off and retired soon after. She said the consultants in charge knew what she was doing and that she was doing her best in an inadequately resourced part of the health service. Dr Barton also said she was under unreasonable and increasing pressure and patients were too poorly for rehabilitation.

"Carter Cookson died in hospital on Saturday evening A three-week-old baby who was in desperate need of a heart transplant has died, his parents have said. Carter Cookson, who was born prematurely on Boxing Day with heart problems, had suffered three cardiac arrests and was on a life-support machine. His parents Sarah and Chris Cookson had been running a social media appeal to find a donor. But on Saturday they posted on Facebook that he had ""gained his angel wings"". The post from Mrs Cookson, 44, said that their ""brave baby boy"" Carter ""could not fight anymore"" and had died at 17:44 GMT. The parents alsoposted on the Find a Heart for Carter Facebook page,external, saying: ""Thank you to everyone who has helped to try and find Carter's gift, we will be eternally grateful."" In 2013, Mr and Mrs Cookson lost their first son, Charlie, aged two. He died of an undiagnosed condition - unrelated to Carter's - which caused problems with his muscles and bones and compromised his immune system. Chris and Sarah Cookson have been with Carter at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital Writing on Facebook, Mrs Cookson added: ""We are heart broken....our two boys are in heaven without their Mammy and Daddy we feel so empty and our hearts will never recover. ""No more pain baby boy, No more tubes..be free with your big brother and Granda...until we can all be together again."" Thousands of people posted their condolences on the social media site beneath a final photograph of Carter. Baby 'has hours to find new heart' PM's pledge to baby needing new heart The Cooksons, from South Shields, South Tyneside, launched an appeal to find a new heart for Carter after being told a transplant was his only hope. Their plea for an organ donor for Carter was shared widely on social media. On Friday, they said doctors at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital had advised them that time was running out. Dozens showed their support for the family at a vigil in South Shields on Thursday Last week, South Shields Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck raised the donor appeal at Prime Minister's Questions. Theresa May described it as a ""tragic case"" and highlighted the ""opt-out""organ donation system due to be introduced next year. A candlelit vigil was held for Carter outside South Shields Town Hall on Thursday evening. Mr and Mrs Cookson launched a charity supporting families of children with life-limiting illnesses in 2013 following the death of Charlie.

"The UN has called on the government to halt the ""excessive use of force"" The Zimbabwean government says the security forces' response to recent protests in which a number of people have reportedly died is just ""a foretaste of things to come"". News of a violent crackdown has emerged despite the government blocking social media sites. Local rights groups said at least 12 people had been killed and many more beaten by security forces. The protests were sparked on Monday by a sharp rise in the price of fuel.

Over the course of the week riot police have clashed with protesters in the capital, Harare, and the southern city of Bulawayo after they lit fires and blocked roads using rocks. On Thursday, Mr Chamisa tweeted that his thoughts were ""with the victims of violence"".

"Theresa May needs to become a mediator to help break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament, former prime minister John Major has said. He wants MPs to be given a vote on all Brexit options, indicating their preference on the way forward. Mrs May should consider dropping her red lines ""in the national interest"" and become a facilitator to find out what Parliament wants, he said. Tory Brexit supporter Suella Braverman dismissed his ""Remainer elite"" views. She said: ""Thank you Sir John, but no thanks."" Liam Fox yet to seal no-deal trade agreements Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal plan' Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said there are ""in reality, just two remaining options"" for Brexit - to instruct the government to negotiate a close relationship with the EU, including a customs union, or for there to be a public vote. He told the Fabian Society conference in London that it ""seems inevitable"" the government will have to apply for an extension to Article 50. Labour has responsibility ""in this moment of national crisis"" to ""offer a constructive path forward"", said Sir Keir, adding that there are ""no easy routes out of this mess"". ""It's now time for an open and frank debate about how we break the deadlock,"" he said. It comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet Mrs May for talks to discuss a way forward, unless she takes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Sir Keir also said what Mrs May is doing is ""not resilient, but reckless"", and that she was ""ploughing on without a plan"" and ""reducing the time for a credible alternative to emerge"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Sir John warned that no deal would be the ""worst of all outcomes"". He said that ""millions of people"" - both individuals and businesses - would be hurt in such a scenario. ""Tinkering"" with her deal will not make a difference to the current situation, he added. By Nick Eardley, political correspondent Westminster is currently stuck on what happens next with Brexit. There are a range of different views in Parliament, but no certainty that any of them would command majority support. Indicative votes are a proposed solution. MPs would be given a free vote on various proposals, from a second referendum to a customs union to a free trade agreement. The idea goes that this would allow MPs to express what they really think, free from party commitments. It could, proponents believe, end the log-jam. But as we've documented at length in recent weeks, there is no guarantee it would. One thing is certain just now; a lot of work still needs to be done if a consensus is to be found. Sir John said the prime minister had been ""handed a poisoned chalice"" and that things had been ""extremely difficult"" for her. ""Her position has been all but impossible,"" he said, adding that Parliament was ""running out of time"". If Mrs May does not drop her red lines ""in the national interest"", then her options are either for the Cabinet or Parliament to decide or for there to be another referendum ""now more facts are known than were known in 2016"", Sir John argued. He said while Cabinet is too split to reach an agreement, there is hope that Parliament could reach a consensus, with Mrs May as a mediator. Please upgrade your browser He told the programme: ""The prime minister argued valiantly for her deal. She fought for it but the House of Commons killed it and killed it comprehensively. ""The prime minister still needs a deal. If she can't deliver one that Parliament accepts, then she needs to become a facilitator, a mediator, to find out what Parliament will accept."" Ideally, all party leaders would give their MPs a free vote to allow an ""honest representation"" of opinion. He called for compromise to prevent any further splits, as ""no one is going to get their way"". It is now very unlikely we will leave the EU on 29 March ""bar a miracle"", he added, arguing that a delay would be ""wise"". Mrs Braverman said some of the options being put forward - including a customs union, allowing continued free movement of people or holding another referendum - would be ""clear breaches"" of promises made by Mrs May, and ignore the will of the people. She has also called for the Irish border backstop - the position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - to be scrapped.

"There's a big problem facing members of Parliament who want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. They can't just show there is a majority in the House of Commons against no deal - they need to prove there is a majority in favour of an alternative outcome. That's because leaving the EU - with or without a deal - is currently the default. If the prime minister fails to get a deal through the House of Commons, the UK will leave with no deal at all unless something changes, because leaving the EU is written into UK law. The EU Withdrawal Act sets 29 March as the date of departure. The wording of the act does allow a minister to change the definition of ""exit day"" relatively quickly using a statutory instrument - a piece of secondary legislation - rather than an entirely new act of Parliament that would need to be debated. A minister would have to propose the change and MPs would have to approve it. But there is a second and more significant reason why no deal would become the default position: that's what EU law says. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. The most obvious way therefore to stop a no-deal Brexit, or any form of Brexit, is to revoke Article 50. Minister talks down Brexit delay claim Bid to limit tax powers if no-deal Brexit Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? TheEuropean Court of Justice has ruledthe UK can do that on its own, without asking the other 27 countries, and stay a member of the EU on its current terms - including opting-out of key policies, and keeping the budget rebate. But it seems highly unlikely that the House of Commons would vote to revoke Article 50 unless there had been another referendum, or maybe an election, in which the public backed the UK remaining in the EU. The government rejects the idea of holding another referendum anyway - and the time to do so before the end of March has run out. So, the other way to avoid a no-deal Brexit in the short term is to play for time and extend the Article 50 period. The government would need to propose that and MPs would have to approve it. But, crucially, unlike in the case of revoking Article 50, to extend it the UK would also need the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. It would probably need to persuade them that something important had changed in UK politics to warrant an extension - perhaps a looming election, or another referendum, rather than more of the same argument. One of the constraints for the rest of the EU is that European elections will take place at the end of May and the new European Parliament (without UK MEPs if Brexit has taken place) is due to meet for the first time in July. The only other circumstance in which a brief extension to Article 50 would probably be approved by the EU is if there had been a vote in favour of Theresa May's deal but a little more time was needed to dot the ""i""s and cross the ""t""s. But if Article 50 was extended without a deal passing the House of Commons, no deal would still remain the default outcome at the end of the extended negotiating period. In a word, amendments. An amendment to the Finance Bill, limiting the Treasury's ability to make no-deal preparations unless authorised by Parliament, was backed by MPs by 303 to 296 votes. This amendment will make it ""harder for the government to drift into no deal without Parliament being able to direct it"", according to Labour MP Yvette Cooper. A cross-party coalition of MPs against no deal is now flexing its muscles, and what we're likely to see over the next couple of months is what some are calling ""guerrilla warfare by amendment"" in the House of Commons. Yvette Cooper says her amendment has support from Remain and Leave MPs The trade bill is likely to be another target - it would be needed in the event of no deal, to try to keep the UK trading on the same terms as it has now with the rest of the world. The idea behind all this parliamentary manoeuvring is to demonstrate that there is a clear majority in the House of Commons against no deal. But none of it, taken in isolation, will prevent the Article 50 clock ticking away until it stops at the end of March. That's why a growing number of MPs support the idea of holding a series of ""indicative votes"" on different potential outcomes, to try to find an alternative to no deal that would enjoy broad  (or even sufficient) support. Senior MPs argue that the government would be unable to ignore the political pressure if the will of the House of Commons was clearly expressed on numerous occasions. But political pressure is not the same as legal reality. Three ministers have said publicly they would resign if the government pursued a no-deal strategy, while others are thought to hold the same position in private. A handful of backbench MPs have said they would quit the party. The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, is understood to have told cabinet that history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country. But if the prime minister did decide to press on regardless, it may well be that the only way MPs could stop a no-deal Brexit at the last moment would be to vote down the government itself. UPDATE -This article was updated on Wednesday 9 Jan to include the new amendment asking government to return to Parliament with new plans within three days of a vote against the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal.

"The UK has yet to finalise agreements to replace existing free trade deals the EU has with 40 big economies if there is a no-deal Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said he ""hoped"" they would but it depended on whether other countries were ""willing to put the work in"". He said more deals were coming, after signing one with Australia. Concerns have been raised that the UK will leave the EU without a deal that would protect current arrangements. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, under the Article 50 process and the UK's EU Withdrawal Act, with or without a deal - unless the UK chooses to revoke Article 50 and continues as a member of the EU. MPs defeated the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by a huge margin earlier this week, which provided for a ""transition period"" of 21 months, under which much of the UK's relationship with the EU would remain the same. Reality Check: Has immigration held down wages? Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal' plan Farage seeking 'new party' for elections Top Germans plead with UK to stay in EU Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit In 2017, Mr Fox said that the UK could ""replicate the 40 free trade agreements before we leave the EU"", so that there would be no disruption to trade. But with just over two months to go until Brexit, not one has been signed, said the BBC's business correspondent Jonty Bloom. The Department for International Trade says some agreements are at an advanced stage but none of the 40 free trade deals that the EU has with other countries have so far been rolled over so that they will cover the UK after Brexit. The closest the UK has come to rolling over a free trade deal is an initial agreement with Switzerland to replicate the existing EU-Switzerland arrangements ""as far as possible"".  But that deal has not been formally signed yet. Asked abouta report in the Financial Times,externalthat Britain would not be close to finalising most of the 40 free trade deals the EU currently has with other countries, Mr Fox told the BBC: ""I hope they will be but there are not just dependent on the UK. Our side is ready. ""It's largely dependent on other whether countries believe that there will be no deal and are willing to put the work in to the preparations."" On Friday, he signed a ""mutual recognition agreement"" with the Australian high commissioner in London - to maintain all current relevant aspects of the agreement it has with the EU. The EU does not have a free trade agreement with Australia. He said there would be a ""pipeline of them to be signed as we go through"" and the agreement made it easier for UK goods to comply with Australian standards. Mr Fox also said that staying in a permanent customs arrangement with the EU would ""not be delivering Brexit"" as he did not believe it would allow the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. Some opposition parties have been making the case for a customs union. Theresa May held talks with the leaders of parties including the SNP and the Lib Dems, about a way forward after she won a confidence vote by a narrow margin in the Commons on Wednesday. She also spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on the telephone on Thursday night, and will be speaking to more EU leaders over the weekend.

But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who wants the UK to be in a permanent customs union with ""strong"" ties to the single market, has refused to take part in talks with the prime minister until she rules out the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal. In a letter to Mrs May, Mr Corbyn said her talks were ""not genuine"". He also accused her of ""sticking rigidly"" to her withdrawal agreement. As many as 20 Tory ministers have also said they would quit the government unless the prime minister allows them to try to stop a no deal Brexit,according to the Telegraph,external. Mrs May says ruling out no deal is impossible as it is not within the government's power.

On Friday a pro-referendum campaign group paid for a wrap-around advertisement in his local newspaper, theIslington Tribune,external, urging him to back a ""public vote on Brexit"". In a speech at JCB Headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said changing the date of leaving from 29 March would be ""shameful"", and the public would view it as ""an elite conspiracy to thwart Brexit"".

"This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? US President Donald Trump has set out new plans on his Mexican wall project to try to end a partial government shutdown lasting more than four weeks. One of his ""compromises"" was on so-called Dreamers - who entered the US illegally when young. He still wants $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) to fund the wall. Democrats have refused to fund it and ahead of the speech had already rejected the expected concessions. The shutdown, the longest in history, has affected 800,000 federal workers. Why has the US government shut down? Six ways the US shutdown ends US shutdown: Workers crowdfund to survive The president started by saying the US had a proud history of welcoming migrants, but that the system had been ""badly broken for a very long time"". He said he was ""here to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown"". He again spelled out his reasons for building the wall and stressed it was not a continuous structure, just one of steel barriers in high-priority areas. But the demand for $5.7bn to fund it remains. This video can not be played Dreamers: ""America is the only country I've known"" The two new ideas concerned the Dreamers and Temporary Protection Status (TPS) holders. There are some 700,000 Dreamers, who were young when they entered the US with their parents illegally, The Dreamers are currently protected from deportation under a programme that allows them to work but not get citizenship. It is a programme Mr Trump has been trying to rescind. But he said he would extend protection for Dreamers for another three years, allowing them continued access to work permits. How much of Trump's wall has been built? Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting How will history judge President Trump? He said he would also extend the visas for TPS holders for three years. More than 300,000 people from countries affected by war or disasters are allowed to work in the US under TPS, another system Mr Trump has opposed. There were other proposals, including $800m in urgent humanitarian assistance, 2,750 more border agents and security officials and 75 new immigration judge teams. Certainly the latter conforms largely with Democrat suggestions. The president said his proposals were ""reasonable with lots of compromise"" and would ""build trust and goodwill"". Donald Trump struck a deal to reopen the government and build his much-promised wall - with one small problem. He was negotiating with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and if he wants to succeed he's going to have to get Democrats on board. It's a touch ironic that the deal Mr Trump outlined - his wall in exchange for protection for certain childhood undocumented migrants and temporary resident aliens - was one the president walked away from last year, when Democrats were the ones instigating a shutdown. After senators thought they had an agreement, the White House issued new demands for reforms to legal immigration. Now Democrats are in control of the House, and the calculus has changed. Mr Trump's offer of temporary immigrant protection probably isn't any greater than the ones courts have already imposed. The president's move may put some pressure on his opponents to return to the negotiating table, but they still feel they have the upper hand. Unless that changes - or the president backs down - the shutdown will drag on. The Democrats responded even before the speech went out. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the concessions ""a non-starter"",externaland ""a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives"". ""What we didn't hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers,externalwho face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown,"" Mrs Pelosi tweeted.

Other key Democrats pre-emptively rejected the plans, sticking by the party's position that it would not negotiate until government was reopened. After the announcement, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump had ""single-handedly"" taken away Dreamers and TPS protections and that offering some protections back was ""not a compromise but more hostage taking"". This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall On the Republican side, Mr McConnell hailed the president's proposal as a ""bold solution to re-open the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues"". Mr McConnell would be seeking Senate passage of the proposal next week, his spokesman said. Opinion polls suggest most voters blame Mr Trump for the shutdown. Some of the 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December are in increasingly dire straits.

Many of the 1,000 people attending the service at Bushey New Cemetery, Hertfordshire, were moved to tears during the service. They included survivors and relatives of victims who were murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols. The donated remains were buried with earth from Israel Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, the Israeli ambassador and the deputy German ambassador were also there. After the ceremony, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must continue to challenge racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry and where hatred can lead."" The MP also said he hoped the funeral would bring people together and underline the message of ""never again, never forget and that none of us can simply stand by the side and allow this to happen"". At least six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis and their allies during World War Two, Many were starved and gassed to death, and their remains incinerated, including more than a million men women and children who were murdered in the Auschwitz death camp in German-occupied Poland. What was the Holocaust? Israel in Danube Holocaust victim search The human remains were among a large number of objects relating to the Holocaust given to the museum by a donor. They are understood to have been removed during a visit to the Auschwitz site several decades ago. The Imperial War Museum (IWM) has a license to hold such items and the remains have been kept in storage for two decades. The leader of the Holocaust Galleries at the IWM, James Bulgin, said: ""The museum receives thousands of objects, but something like this is unusual to the point of complete uniqueness. ""Hundreds of thousands of people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Anybody who lost a relative there can consider these remains and think they could belong to my grandfather or mother."" Mr Bulgin described the process of discovering details about the remains as ""difficult"", adding: ""These remains are fragments and also ash, and some of that can't be analysed further."" Through forensic analysis the museum was able to find out that the fragments were the human remains of adults and children. But because the process is limited, ages, gender or other personal details remain unknown. In his address, Rabbi Mirvis addressed the six victims. He said: ""We don't know who you are, we don't know if you're male or female, we don't know which country you're from, but one thing we do know; you were Jewish and brutally murdered. ""You were let down badly at the time and now your remains have somehow come to the UK. And we have the opportunity of granting you the dignity and honour of a funeral service."" About 1,000 people attended the service in Hertfordshire Previously Rabbi Mirvis said the symbolism of the funeral service was enormous. ""We find exceptional poignancy in the fact that there are six souls that we are burying,"" he said. ""Each one stands for one million souls who perished. And interestingly enough there were just under five million who were adults and just over one million who were children."" Rabbi Mirvis added: ""There were members of my family who perished in the Holocaust and we all related to this directly. Now we will have the opportunity to accord them some dignity and to give them a final resting place."" He said he hoped the site would become a place of pilgrimage for Jewish families, much like the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

"This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? US President Donald Trump has set out new plans on his Mexican wall project to try to end a partial government shutdown lasting more than four weeks. One of his ""compromises"" was on so-called Dreamers - who entered the US illegally when young. He still wants $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) to fund the wall. Democrats have refused to fund it and ahead of the speech had already rejected the expected concessions. The shutdown, the longest in history, has affected 800,000 federal workers. Why has the US government shut down? Six ways the US shutdown ends US shutdown: Workers crowdfund to survive The president started by saying the US had a proud history of welcoming migrants, but that the system had been ""badly broken for a very long time"". He said he was ""here to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown"". He again spelled out his reasons for building the wall and stressed it was not a continuous structure, just one of steel barriers in high-priority areas. But the demand for $5.7bn to fund it remains. This video can not be played Dreamers: ""America is the only country I've known"" The two new ideas concerned the Dreamers and Temporary Protection Status (TPS) holders. There are some 700,000 Dreamers, who were young when they entered the US with their parents illegally, The Dreamers are currently protected from deportation under a programme that allows them to work but not get citizenship. It is a programme Mr Trump has been trying to rescind. But he said he would extend protection for Dreamers for another three years, allowing them continued access to work permits. How much of Trump's wall has been built? Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting How will history judge President Trump? He said he would also extend the visas for TPS holders for three years. More than 300,000 people from countries affected by war or disasters are allowed to work in the US under TPS, another system Mr Trump has opposed. There were other proposals, including $800m in urgent humanitarian assistance, 2,750 more border agents and security officials and 75 new immigration judge teams. Certainly the latter conforms largely with Democrat suggestions. The president said his proposals were ""reasonable with lots of compromise"" and would ""build trust and goodwill"". Donald Trump struck a deal to reopen the government and build his much-promised wall - with one small problem. He was negotiating with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and if he wants to succeed he's going to have to get Democrats on board. It's a touch ironic that the deal Mr Trump outlined - his wall in exchange for protection for certain childhood undocumented migrants and temporary resident aliens - was one the president walked away from last year, when Democrats were the ones instigating a shutdown. After senators thought they had an agreement, the White House issued new demands for reforms to legal immigration. Now Democrats are in control of the House, and the calculus has changed. Mr Trump's offer of temporary immigrant protection probably isn't any greater than the ones courts have already imposed. The president's move may put some pressure on his opponents to return to the negotiating table, but they still feel they have the upper hand. Unless that changes - or the president backs down - the shutdown will drag on. The Democrats responded even before the speech went out. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the concessions ""a non-starter"",externaland ""a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives"". ""What we didn't hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers,externalwho face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown,"" Mrs Pelosi tweeted.

Other key Democrats pre-emptively rejected the plans, sticking by the party's position that it would not negotiate until government was reopened. After the announcement, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump had ""single-handedly"" taken away Dreamers and TPS protections and that offering some protections back was ""not a compromise but more hostage taking"". This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall On the Republican side, Mr McConnell hailed the president's proposal as a ""bold solution to re-open the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues"". Mr McConnell would be seeking Senate passage of the proposal next week, his spokesman said. Opinion polls suggest most voters blame Mr Trump for the shutdown.

It was passed to West Midlands police, who contacted the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Footage of car on fire in Londonderry A bomb has exploded inside a car outside the courthouse in Londonderry. The explosion occurred in Bishop Street at about 20:15 GMT on Saturday, shortly after police received a warning. Officers were on the scene when the blast occurred. No one is believed to have been injured. Police had just started evacuating nearby buildings, including a hotel, when the explosion took place. A cordon remains in place at the scene. Local politicians have told the BBC that the vehicle was hijacked in Derry some time before the explosion. An eyewitness told the BBC: ""The remains of the car could still be seen burning in the middle of the road. ""A cordon has been set up around the scene and police are evacuating more buildings on Bishop Street."" The cordon remained in place on Sunday morning as officers inspect the scene In a statement issued on Facebook, the PSNI said: ""As far as we know no one [is] injured."" However, they said that there is another car they ""are not happy about"" and are evacuating the area and advising residents in the area to make preparations to leave. Greg McLaughlin, who lives nearby, said his windows shook with the force of the blast. ""It was very, very loud. I knew right away this was a bomb,"" he said. ""We knew it was quite close. ""You could see the ball of fire on the street. It  sounded to me like a very significant blast. I haven't heard anything like it in Derry for quite a while."" Businesses and other properties have been evacuated and the cordon on Bishop Street has been extended. One business owner said she heard a bang and was lucky to be inside at the time. She said she could have been on the street minutes later. Bishop Street is within Derry's famous city walls. The PSNI has asked members of the public to stay away. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the explosion had caused major disruption in the Bishop Street area of the city. ""This has to be condemned in its strongest terms, taking place on a Saturday evening when many people are out enjoying themselves. ""The loss of trade for the local hospitality sector and the impact that this will have on tourism and the local economy benefits no one."" The Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was concerned at the reports coming from Londonderry and was ""being kept informed by PSNI"". Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said the incident had ""shocked the local community"". ""In particular, there are many elderly residents who live in the area who have been alarmed by this incident,"" she said. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan tweeted: ""Whoever is responsible for this explosion outside Bishop Street Courthouse in Derry clearly hasn't got the message that the people of Derry DO NOT want this on our streets."" The DUP MLA, Gary Middleton, described the incident as a ""disgraceful act of terrorism"". His party leader Arlene Foster tweeted: ""This pointless act of terror must be condemned in the strongest terms. Only hurts the people of the city. ""Perpetrated by people with no regard for life. Grateful to our emergency services for their swift actions which helped ensure there have been no fatalities or injuries."" The Irish tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney condemned the attack.

"This video can not be played Thirty-four Holocaust survivors accompanied the casket to the burial site The UK's Chief Rabbi has urged an end to rising anti-Semitism, at a funeral for six unknown Auschwitz victims whose remains were donated to a museum. Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said hate speech ""can easily be translated into hate crime"" and the service was a reminder to confront all forms of racism. The remains of five adults and one child were anonymously donated to the Imperial War Museum in 1997. The unknown victims were buried with earth from Israel. Rabbi Mirvis warned: ""When anti-Semitism is allowed to thrive, some people can do anything and some people can reach the lowest end of human conduct."" Many of the 1,000 people attending the service at Bushey New Cemetery, Hertfordshire, were moved to tears during the service. They included survivors and relatives of victims who were murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols. The donated remains were buried with earth from Israel Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, the Israeli ambassador and the deputy German ambassador were also there. After the ceremony, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must continue to challenge racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry and where hatred can lead."" The MP also said he hoped the funeral would bring people together and underline the message of ""never again, never forget and that none of us can simply stand by the side and allow this to happen"". At least six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis and their allies during World War Two, Many were starved and gassed to death, and their remains incinerated, including more than a million men women and children who were murdered in the Auschwitz death camp in German-occupied Poland. What was the Holocaust? Israel in Danube Holocaust victim search The human remains were among a large number of objects relating to the Holocaust given to the museum by a donor. They are understood to have been removed during a visit to the Auschwitz site several decades ago. The Imperial War Museum (IWM) has a license to hold such items and the remains have been kept in storage for two decades. The leader of the Holocaust Galleries at the IWM, James Bulgin, said: ""The museum receives thousands of objects, but something like this is unusual to the point of complete uniqueness. ""Hundreds of thousands of people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Anybody who lost a relative there can consider these remains and think they could belong to my grandfather or mother."" Mr Bulgin described the process of discovering details about the remains as ""difficult"", adding: ""These remains are fragments and also ash, and some of that can't be analysed further."" Through forensic analysis the museum was able to find out that the fragments were the human remains of adults and children. But because the process is limited, ages, gender or other personal details remain unknown. In his address, Rabbi Mirvis addressed the six victims. He said: ""We don't know who you are, we don't know if you're male or female, we don't know which country you're from, but one thing we do know; you were Jewish and brutally murdered. ""You were let down badly at the time and now your remains have somehow come to the UK. And we have the opportunity of granting you the dignity and honour of a funeral service."" About 1,000 people attended the service in Hertfordshire Previously Rabbi Mirvis said the symbolism of the funeral service was enormous. ""We find exceptional poignancy in the fact that there are six souls that we are burying,"" he said. ""Each one stands for one million souls who perished. And interestingly enough there were just under five million who were adults and just over one million who were children."" Rabbi Mirvis added: ""There were members of my family who perished in the Holocaust and we all related to this directly. Now we will have the opportunity to accord them some dignity and to give them a final resting place."" He said he hoped the site would become a place of pilgrimage for Jewish families, much like the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. But he also reflected on the memorial's timeliness for wider society, adding: ""We need a strong reminder such as this to let us know what can result, even within a democratic society, what can result if anti-Semitism, if racism and xenophobia, go unchecked."" The Prince of Wales, who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, has sent a letter of condolence to the Jewish community.

"BBC News' stills photographer Jeff Overs captured these views of the eclipse in Brighton, UK (montage) A lunar eclipse, which some are referring to as a ""super blood wolf moon"", has delighted skywatchers around the world. During the spectacular event, the Earth's natural satellite turns a striking shade of red. The entire eclipse was visible from North and South America, as well as parts of western Europe (including the UK) and north Africa. In pictures: 'Super blood wolf moon' This kind of eclipse occurs when the Earth passes precisely between the Sun and the Moon. In this situation, the Sun is behind the Earth, and the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. Yes. Some commentators are referring to the event as a ""super blood wolf moon"". The ""super"" part comes from the fact that the Moon will be near its closest approach to the Earth - when it will be marginally bigger in the sky than usual. The ""wolf"" part comes from the name given to full moons in January - ""wolf moons"". Walter Freeman, an assistant teaching professor at Syracuse University in New York state, said: ""A little bit of sunlight is refracted by the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the Moon, bending around the edges of the Earth. This small amount of red light still illuminates the Moon enough for us to see it."" The moon seen beside a quadriga on top of the Cinquantenaire arch in Brussels The eclipse began at 02:35 GMT on Monday and ended at 07:49 GMT, but the point of greatest eclipse occurred at 05:12 GMT. In the UK, the Moon was above the horizon throughout the eclipse, though from the extreme south-east of England the Sun had risen as the eclipse ended. This video can not be played Elizabeth Rizzini explains the ""super blood wolf moon"" - and forecasts the weather for UK skywatchers on Monday This eclipse was also visible in north-western France, north-western Spain, Portugal, a small part of west Africa, almost the whole of North and South America, the eastern Pacific, and the north-eastern tip of Russia. While solar eclipses are dangerous to view directly, the light from lunar eclipses is much fainter and so is completely safe to view without special equipment. The event was the last chance for skywatchers in the UK to see a total lunar eclipse in its entirety until 2029 - weather permitting.

"Felix Tshisekedi's supporters celebrated the court ruling Two African presidents have congratulated Democratic Republic of Congo opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi for winning last month's presidential poll, despite the African Union saying it had ""serious doubts"" about the result. The constitutional court ruled that Mr Tshisekedi had won after rejecting a challenge from rival Martin Fayulu. He said Mr Tshisekedi made a deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila. Mr Tshisekedi's team denies this. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta and South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa both sent their congratulations. How does Tshisekedi's victory in DR Congo add up? The divisive aftermath of Tshisekedi's victory Tshisekedi steps out of his father's shadow Mr Ramaphosa called on all parties ""to respect the decision of the constitutional court and commit to continue with a journey of consolidating peace"". Martin Fayulu insists he is the ""legitimate president"" The southern African regional group, Sadc, has also welcomed Mr Tshisekedi's victory saying that all Congolese should support the president-elect in his bid to maintain ""unity, peace and stability"". The African Union, which was supposed to send a delegation to the DR Congo on Monday, has now postponed the trip. On Friday, it had called on the court to refrain from ruling on the result of the vote. Mr Fayulu, who the electoral commission said was the runner-up in the 30 December election, said he was the ""legitimate"" president. Accusations of fraud are supported by comments from some election observers including the influential Catholic Church. Mr Fayulu said his supporters should organise ""non-violent protests all over the country to defend its sovereignty"". The court said Mr Fayulu had failed to prove that the election commission had announced false results. It went on to declare Felix Tshisekedi ""president of the Democratic Republic of Congo by simple majority"". He is now expected to be sworn in within 10 days. This video can not be played Joy and dismay at DR Congo election results Violence has always accompanied the change of leadership in the country. But the row over the the results has dented hopes the election could bring the first orderly transfer of power since DR Congo's independence from Belgium in 1960. The electoral commission earlier announced that Mr Tshisekedi had received 38.5% of the vote, compared with 34.7% for Mr Fayulu. Ruling coalition candidate Emmanuel Shadary took 23.8%. However, Mr Fayulu had argued that Mr Tshisekedi had struck a deal with Mr Kabila, who has been in office for 18 years. Felix Tshisekedi leads DR Congo's largest opposition party, founded by his late father Mr Kabila was constitutionally ineligible to run for a third consecutive term. The election should have taken place by the end of 2016 but was repeatedly postponed because of logistical problems, officials said. There were a series of delays on voting day. The failure of new electronic voting machines in some polling stations was one of the challenges. The run-up to the poll was marred by violence and controversy over the decision to delay voting in some areas for health and security reasons - in effect excluding some 1.26 million out of an electorate of nearly 40 million. The official figures have been disputed by the Catholic Church which says it deployed 40,000 election monitors across the country. International experts based in the US, and the French and German governments, have also raised doubts. Data that was leaked to journalists from three outlets -including the Financial Times newspaper,external- working alongside a New York-based think tank, the Congo Research Group (CRG), also indicated that Mr Fayulu had won.

"This video can not be played Suspected fuel thieves have been blamed for rupturing the pipeline Mexican authorities now say at least 79 people were killed in Friday night's fuel pipeline blast. It is believed the explosion occurred after the line was ruptured by suspected fuel thieves in the town of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state. Officials say scores of people had been scrambling to fill up containers and were engulfed in an inferno. Dozens of charred bodies remain at the scene, which is cordoned off by security forces. Hidalgo state governor Omar Fayad said74 people had been hospitalised after the blast.,external Locals said President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft had created shortages. Why are there fuel shortages in Mexico? ""Everyone came to see if they could get a bit of gasoline for their car,"" farmer Isaias GarcÃ­a told Reuters news agency. ""There isn't any in petrol stations."" Relatives gather at the scene as forensic workers carry out inspections Distraught relatives have continued to gather at site of the explosion. Forensic experts have been photographing remains amid a backdrop of burned clothing and discarded fuel buckets. A few litres of fuel are worth more than the daily minimum wage in Mexico. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, said the fire had been caused by illegal tapping. It is believed thieves drilled through the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline - just a few miles away from a large refinery - causing a large jet of gasoline to rise into the air. Mexican officials say up to 800 people, seeing the gasoline geyser, then flocked around it to fill up containers. It erupted into flame a couple of hours later. At a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the firm had been aware of a leak along the pipeline at 16:50 local time. Mr Romero said a valve had been closed to stem the leak, but he did not say what time it was shut. The pipeline has been closed since late December because of repeated hits by gangs. Since reopening on 16 January, it has been targeted four more times, according to Pemex. Some locals criticised security forces at the scene for not warning people more forcibly to get away from the leaking fuel. But President LÃ³pez Obrador defended the army against criticism, saying only 25 soldiers were present and villagers ignored warnings not to get close. He also avoided criticising the people, saying if they had to resort to ""extremes"" by stealing fuel ""it's because they were abandoned"". President LÃ³pez Obrador added that, even if the pipeline had been sealed immediately after the leak, 10,000 barrels-worth of gasoline would have still been trapped in the section of pipeline between Tlahuelilpan and the nearby refinery. Prosecutors will be investigating the incident. Fuel theft, known locally as ""huachicoleo"" (or moonshining) is rampant in some Mexican communities. The government has said the practice cost the country about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) last year. President LÃ³pez Obrador says the crackdown on fuel thieves will intensify President LÃ³pez Obrador, who took office in December, has launched a major crackdown. Thousands of marines have been deployed to guard pipelines, some of which have been shut down altogether in places. The policy has led to increased reliance on tanker deliveries and there have been widespread reports of long lines at petrol stations. After the blast, Mr Fayad issued a plea on Twitter to try to avoid further disasters. ""I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,""Mr Fayad posted (in Spanish),external. ""Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk. What happened today in Tlahuelilpan should not be repeated."" President LÃ³pez Obrador vowed to press on with his anti-theft policy until it was eradicated. ""Rather than stopping the strategy, the fight against the illegality and theft of fuel, it will be strengthened,"" he told reporters. Pemex has suffered a number of other deadly accidents in the past. At least 37 people were killed in an explosion at its Mexico City headquarters in 2013 and another 26 died in a fire at a gas facility in 2012. Mexico blast kills and injures dozens.

"This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""We can compromise... with the European Union over the backstop"" Brexiteer cabinet minister Liam Fox has accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to ""steal Brexit"", amid backbench moves to take control of the process. He told the BBC: ""You've got a Leave population and a Remain Parliament. Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process."" There are various backbench moves to prevent the UK leaving the European Union without a deal on 29 March. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said the PM should rule out a no-deal Brexit. He said he believed it was ""inevitable"" that Article 50 would be delayed and that events in Parliament last week - whenMPs heavily rejected the withdrawal dealTheresa May has negotiated with the EU - mean that another referendum was now more likely. He told the BBC the prime minister must also change her ""red lines"" adding: ""If she won't, it's difficult to see where we go from here."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We're facing a possible no deal and therefore a public vote"" On Monday, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs setting out how she intends to proceed with Brexit, amid apparent deadlock in Parliament over a way forward. She will also table a motion to be debated and voted on, on 29 January. It is expected that various MPs will try to amend that motion over the course of the next week to put forward proposals to test the will of the Commons. International Trade Secretary Mr Fox told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process because Parliament has said to the people of this country: 'We make a contract with you, you will make the decision and we will honour it.' Brexit: A really simple guide Liam Fox yet to seal no-deal trade agreements Theresa May should become mediator, says Sir John Major ""What we are now getting are some of those who were always absolutely opposed to the result of the referendum, trying to hijack Brexit and, in fact, steal the result from the people."" He warned that, if the referendum result was not honoured: ""The consequences politically would be astronomical"" Mr Fox also said that he believed the way to break the deadlock was to win over more Conservative MPs to the PM's deal by finding a ""different mechanism"" to the controversial ""backstop"" proposal, to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Two cross-party groups involving Labour's Yvette Cooper, and Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve are planning on tabling bills that could take a no-deal Brexit off the table Various MPs are likely to try to amend the PM's ""neutral"" motion - simply saying that the Commons has considered the PM's statement - which Theresa May will put forward on Monday. One group, including Labour's Yvette Cooper, the Conservative former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, among others, want the UK to extend its negotiations with the EU beyond 29 March - if MPs do not approve a withdrawal agreement by 26 February. Please upgrade your browser MPs voted in favour ofinvoking Article 50of the Lisbon Treaty - which allows the UK and EU two years to negotiate the terms of Brexit - in 2017 and the 29 March date is in UK legislation - the EU Withdrawal Act. Ms Morgan told Sky News the law would have to be changed if the UK was to be prevented from leaving the EU without a deal in place - and that is where the ""very short"" bill she is backing came in. Meanwhile Conservative Remainer Dominic Grieve wants backbench MPs to be able to choose to debate and vote on Brexit issues, one day a week - breaking with the usual practice where the government controls the parliamentary timetable. Mr Grieve said those debates could then give an indication to the government about what the Commons wanted. ""My intention is not to stop Brexit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House. ""My intention has always been to try to ensure that the government is forced to listen to what the majority view of the House of Commons is on this."" But Conservative Brexiteer Peter Bone said Mr Grieve had ""lost the plot"" and his plan would not get through Parliament. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent The government is continuing to look at ideas to end the deadlock in Parliament over Brexit. The key one Liam Fox was alluding to this morning is finding an alternative to the ""backstop"". But some MPs are now so angry with the government, they want to take control. Dominic Grieve's plan would allow Parliament to put its own ideas forward and be voted on. The working plan is 300 MPs would have to back a proposal for it to be discussed. A majority would have to then back it for it to be approved. The battle for control of Plan B is well under way. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Brexit: What happens now? No-deal Brexit: Can Parliament stop it? It was backed by MPsand invoked on 29 March 2017, meaning the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year. But the withdrawal agreement reached by the EU and UK wasrejected by MPs by 432 votes to 202 on Tuesday. If MPs do not approve a deal, the UK is due to leave the EU without one, which would mean trade reverting to World Trade Organization rules. To extend Article 50, the UK would first have to make a request to the EU - which could be granted if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council. Then it would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of ""exit day"" in the UK's EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change. According to anEuropean Court of Justice ruling in December, the UK could choose to cancel Brexit altogether without seeking the permission of the rest of the EU - something the government says it has no intention of doing.

"Migration has once again become one of the most important issues in Europe. Italy's decision in June not to accept therescue vessel Aquariuswith more than 600 migrants on board attracted widespread criticism, and the issue of border controls for migrantsthreatened to break up the German coalition government. So, how many people are arriving now, where are they from and what is happening to those who have arrived in the EU in previous years? The highest number of arrivals - 1,015,078 - was recorded in 2015. More than 800,000 of them were trafficked by sea from Turkey to Greece, and the majority of them continued to travel through Europe to reach Germany and Sweden. Since 2015, the number of refugees and migrants arriving in Greece has fallen dramatically, after the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to send back to Turkey migrants who do not apply for asylum or whose claim was rejected. While the number of arrivals has dropped in Greece, the number of people arriving in Italy showed little change until 2018 when it also dropped considerably. In 2016 and 2017, 180,000 and 119,000 arrived in Italy respectively, smuggled by traffickers from North Africa and rescued at sea. In 2017, Italy received 67% of the EU's migrant arrivals. However, since January this year, the number of arrivals in Italy has greatly reduced, with 20,120 arriving by mid-September 2018. In the same period, Spain received the highest number of migrants and refugees - almost 35,000 - the majority of them by sea and more than 5,300 by land to Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says that routes used by human traffickers are constantly changing and are dependent on a number of factors, but the drop in numbers reaching Italy is attributed mainly to its close co-operation with the Libyan coastguard. A total of 20,760 have arrived in Greece so far this year, bringing the total number of arrivals in the EU in 2018 to just over 76,000 Syria is still the most common country of origin of those arriving in Greece. Arrivals from Iraq and Afghanistan are also among the top countries of origin. In Italy and Spain, arrivals from mostly African countries top the list. In Italy, the most common country of origin is Tunisia, followed by Eritrea, Sudan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Spain received most of its migrants from Guinea, followed by Morocco and Mali, as well as the Ivory Coast, Syria and a number of other Sub-Saharan African countries. The highest estimatednumber of dead and missing migrants in the Mediterranean,external- 5,096 - was recorded in 2016, despite a significant drop in migrant crossings compared with the previous year. Since then the number of deaths has fallen. The Mediterranean crossing is becoming deadlier every year, if the number of estimated deaths is viewed as a proportion of the number of people who actually manage to reach the EU. In 2015, there was one death in every 269 arrivals recorded. In 2016, this went up to one death in 72 arrivals and in 2017 to one in 57 arrivals. But based on figures to mid-September 2018, the deadliest year so far has been this year, with one death for every 49 people who arrived in the EU. That's because in 2014 and 2015 the majority of refugees and migrants arriving in the EU entered Greece from Turkey, using a much shorter sea route, while since 2016, that has been replaced by a much longer and more dangerous route -  to Italy from Libya. The top countries by origin of asylum seekers in the EU since 2014 are Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan, all countries with recent or ongoing conflicts. Between 2014 and 2017, a total of more than 919,000 Syrians applied for asylum in the EU. Asylum seekers from Eritrea, Bangladesh, Somalia, Iran and a number of Sub-Saharan countries are among the top 10 countries of origin of those who have been applying for asylum in the EU since 2014. Sharing the burden of asylum applications equally between the EU countries is once again the top issue on the EU agenda. TheJune EU summit,where the leaders agreed that member states should distribute asylum seekers among themselves, has not solved the issue because the redistribution will be only on a voluntary basis. The number of first-time asylum applications reached a record level in 2016 and has fallen since. Each asylum application is assessed on an individual basis. The process can take many years, and those who apply for asylum are given basic housing, food, education and healthcare. At the end of the process, asylum is granted to those who can prove they fled war and persecution, while those who do not meet the criteria are refused asylum. The top country for successful asylum applications is Germany, followed by France, Italy, Austria and Sweden. The governments of the EU countries have warned that those who do not have a legitimate asylum claim will be returned to their country of origin. TheEuropean Commission,externalestimated that there were more than two million people staying in the EU illegally in 2015. Hundreds of thousands of those who do not qualify for asylum have been returned since then, but there are still hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants living in the EU. The European Commission says it does not want its migration policy to be judged on how many returns there have been and that its aim is that everyone who qualifies for asylum gets it, with people who are not eligible not coming in the first place. Correction 30 July: The chart on successful asylum applications has been amended to include the total number of first-instance decisions.

"The way we all talk about people moving to a different country can be confusing. You'll have heard the different terms: migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants. There has been a small spike in the number of people crossing the English Channel to get to the UK in the last few months, causing the debate to resurface. Many of those trying to reach Britain are from Iran and Pakistan. But is there a correct way to describe them? Dr. Charlotte Taylor is a senior lecturer at the Centre for Migration at the University of Sussex. She writes about how the media use language to describe people crossing borders. We got her help to explain more about some of the terms we keep hearing. People cue for support in Spain The term you might hear most often. This is a person who moves from one place to another, in order to find work or better living conditions. So if you live in the UK and decide to head off to work in Spain for a few months this summer, you could be described as a migrant. Charlotte Taylor says a migrant can be a safe term: ""It is at the moment, but it won't necessarily continue to be a safe term. They change over time"". Where it gets a bit more tricky is political migration. This can be when someone moves to get away from a certain regime. Charlotte does have concerns about words used around migration such as ""wave, flow, flooded by"". She believes this type of language can mean people in a country where migrants are regularly arriving can see them as ""products not people"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron wascriticised in 2015for talking about ""a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain"". This is when a person comes to live permanently in a foreign country. They don't have to have been forced from or pushed out of their own country, it can be a choice. There is something very different about an illegal and legal immigrant, however valid the reasons for movement. One has been allowed to come to a country through approved documents - an illegal immigrant has not. Charlotte Taylor says media in the UK often discuss immigration and not emigration, which is when people leave their home country. ""Emigration has nearly dropped out of conversation,"" she says. She thinks, despite an improvement in tone over the last 30 years, it's partly down to some hostility towards immigration. ""They are now seen as really separate processes. People don't recognise the similarities."" A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster. ""It's a very different kind of status,"" says Dr. Charlotte Taylor. ""As soon as you acknowledge someone is a refugee you acknowledge they have a certain set of rights. ""They have been driven by circumstances beyond their control."" A group rescued in the Mediterranean Sea This person could be a combination of all of the above, although they are asking for international protection in another country. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid questioned whether people in boats travelling from France to the UK were genuine asylum seekersearlier this month. Some political opponents and campaigners said his comments were ""deeply concerning"". Mr Javid's argument was that some of the people were coming from France - which is deemed a safe country - rather than their place of origin. Asylum seeker is the term Charlotte feels comfortable with using for people coming on these small, often unsafe, boats across The Channel. ""If someone is seeking asylum, they are seeking asylum. ""I was very surprised to see that distinction between genuine and non-genuine asylum. It may be rejected but the seeking [part] is a fact."" EU rules allow a country such as the UK to return an adult asylum seeker to thefirst European country they reached.,external Asylum seekers often say they want to come to the UK because they want to speak English, and because they have family connections in the country.

"This video can not be played Suspected fuel thieves have been blamed for rupturing the pipeline Mexican authorities now say at least 79 people were killed in Friday night's fuel pipeline blast. It is believed the explosion occurred after the line was ruptured by suspected fuel thieves in the town of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state. Officials say scores of people had been scrambling to fill up containers and were engulfed in an inferno. Dozens of charred bodies remain at the scene, which is cordoned off by security forces. Hidalgo state governor Omar Fayad said74 people had been hospitalised after the blast.,external Locals said President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft had created shortages. Why are there fuel shortages in Mexico? ""Everyone came to see if they could get a bit of gasoline for their car,"" farmer Isaias GarcÃ­a told Reuters news agency. ""There isn't any in petrol stations."" Relatives gather at the scene as forensic workers carry out inspections Distraught relatives have continued to gather at site of the explosion. Forensic experts have been photographing remains amid a backdrop of burned clothing and discarded fuel buckets. A few litres of fuel are worth more than the daily minimum wage in Mexico. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, said the fire had been caused by illegal tapping. It is believed thieves drilled through the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline - just a few miles away from a large refinery - causing a large jet of gasoline to rise into the air. Mexican officials say up to 800 people, seeing the gasoline geyser, then flocked around it to fill up containers. It erupted into flame a couple of hours later. At a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the firm had been aware of a leak along the pipeline at 16:50 local time. Mr Romero said a valve had been closed to stem the leak, but he did not say what time it was shut. The pipeline has been closed since late December because of repeated hits by gangs. Since reopening on 16 January, it has been targeted four more times, according to Pemex. Some locals criticised security forces at the scene for not warning people more forcibly to get away from the leaking fuel. But President LÃ³pez Obrador defended the army against criticism, saying only 25 soldiers were present and villagers ignored warnings not to get close. He also avoided criticising the people, saying if they had to resort to ""extremes"" by stealing fuel ""it's because they were abandoned"". President LÃ³pez Obrador added that, even if the pipeline had been sealed immediately after the leak, 10,000 barrels-worth of gasoline would have still been trapped in the section of pipeline between Tlahuelilpan and the nearby refinery. Prosecutors will be investigating the incident. Fuel theft, known locally as ""huachicoleo"" (or moonshining) is rampant in some Mexican communities. The government has said the practice cost the country about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) last year. President LÃ³pez Obrador says the crackdown on fuel thieves will intensify President LÃ³pez Obrador, who took office in December, has launched a major crackdown. Thousands of marines have been deployed to guard pipelines, some of which have been shut down altogether in places. The policy has led to increased reliance on tanker deliveries and there have been widespread reports of long lines at petrol stations. After the blast, Mr Fayad issued a plea on Twitter to try to avoid further disasters. ""I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,""Mr Fayad posted (in Spanish),external. ""Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk. What happened today in Tlahuelilpan should not be repeated."" President LÃ³pez Obrador vowed to press on with his anti-theft policy until it was eradicated. ""Rather than stopping the strategy, the fight against the illegality and theft of fuel, it will be strengthened,"" he told reporters.

Staffordshire Police published the mock-up of a ""very skinny"" suspect with wide eyes and a long neck, expecting the public's response to be good. But its effort was widely derided, with one social media user asking if the thief's getaway vehicle had been a ""BMX with a basket on the front"".

And a further comment read: ""If I see her I won't be calling Staffordshire Police, I'll be calling Mulder and Scully.""

"US officials say China is trying to influence US policymakers, steal secrets and spy on the US government. But how? The story of Kevin Mallory, a man who seemed to lead a typical suburban life in Virginia, provides the answer. FBI agents pointed their weapons at Jeremiah Mallory, a teenager standing in the doorway of his house one morning in June 2017, and told him to get on his knees. ""They've got guns in his face,"" says Patsy Clark, a family friend. They were looking for evidence against his father, Kevin Mallory, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer who had been spying for the Chinese government. One of Mallory's neighbours, a dog walker, was heading down the block: ""All of a sudden I hear this yelling."" The roar of helicopters woke another neighbour, Delrose Winter, who says she saw police cars and black vans at the house. Cameron Norris, a student who lived nearby, saw dogs searching the yard and FBI agents carrying boxes: ""They were taking equipment out - a computer."" FBI agents searched Mallory's house, a place with a red banner covered in Chinese calligraphy that hung alongside the front door, his yard and, according to neighbours, a bridle path where he used to go on runs. His street in Raspberry Falls, a Leesburg subdivision, looked like a war zone, with helicopters circling in the air and armed men charging through the grass. At home, Mallory secretly communicated with Chinese agents One year later Mallory, 61, was found guilty of espionage. In a real-life episode of The Americans, a TV spy drama that takes place in northern Virginia, Mallory had lived a double life: he helped people on his street with yard work, went to church and assisted immigrants with income-tax forms. Yet at home he communicated with Chinese agents through social media and sold them US secrets. Today he faces life in prison - and he is now awaiting sentencing. His punishment may serve as a warning to others who may be contemplating espionage, say US justice department officials. It also highlights the tense nature of the US-China relationship. The US has entered a new ""cold war"", said the CIA's Mike Collins, deputy assistant director at the agency's East Asia mission centre,at the Aspen Security Forum,externallast year. Chinese officials are investing billions of US dollars in global influence operations and espionage, according toresearch,externalby a former CIA analyst, Peter Mattis. The Chinese officials are attempting to gain inside information about the White House and the government, according to US officials, and shape the way that Beijing policies and its commercial and military activities are perceived on the world stage. Loudoun County's Kristen Umstattd says she's concerned about Chinese broadcasting in Virginia Chinese officials are attempting to sway the views of politicians and ordinary Americans, according to US officials, so they will support policies that are favourable to Beijing on issues ranging from the South China Sea to currency manipulation. Last month US Assistant Attorney General John Demerstestified,externalbefore Congress about China's ""covert efforts to influence the American public"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who previously served as CIA director,told the BBC's Gordon Coreralast year that the Chinese government is trying to ""infiltrate the United States with spies"". This video can not be played Then-CIA Director: China intent on stealing US secrets A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said the accusations are false. ""We never do such things as interference or infiltration,"" she said. ""That is definitely not Chinese style."" In Beijing, state officials view the US with suspicion, and espionage is punished severely. Between 2011-12, 10 individuals who were working undercover in China for the CIA were killed, according to theNew York Times,external. ""One was shot in front of his colleagues in the courtyard of a government building - a message to others,"" the New York Times reporters claimed, citing US officials. Where Mallory went jogging Meanwhile President Xi has made it clear that influence operations in other countries are a priority for his government. He has done this by expanding the efforts of the United Front Work Department,according to Xinhua,external, the state-run news agency. The United Front was created in the 1930s in order to marshal forces behind the Communist Party by providing a ""united front"" for the party among those who are living abroad. This means that today when Chinese students in the US publicly contradict party positions, Beijing officials may inform their family in China that they have spoken out in a ""subversive"" manner,according to a report,external, Chinese Influence and American Interests. Chinese American students say they're singled out for scrutiny by the Beijing officials and also by US officials who suspect them of being spies. As many as one in five Asian Americans who were accused of espionage since 2009 were never convicted, according to legal scholar Andrew Kim, theauthor of a May 2017 report,externalabout espionage. He showed that the rate is twice as high as that among individuals with non-Asian backgrounds. Leesburg, a town in Loudoun County, provides a textbook example of the Communist Party's mode of operations. Located 40 miles from Washington, Leesburg has old-fashioned streetlamps, brick sidewalks and picket fences, evoking authentic Americana, and seems far from global conflict. Yet Chinese agents lured Mallory, working out of his Leesburg home, into their spy ring. Separately Chinese officials obtained access to the airwaves of a local radio station. The Chinese officials bought access to a Leesburg station, WCRW 1190 AM, through a subsidiary company. The 50,000-watt station used to be housed in a low-slung building with plate-glass windows, but the place was sold to a family several years ago. WCRW towers in Ashburn, shown above, broadcast programmes to Washington Under a new style of management, WCRW transmitters were moved to Ashburn, a town closer to Washington. The radio towers are posted on property owned by a company, Loudoun Water, near an installation of China's Zigong Lantern Festival, a travelling exhibit that was open in December. ""They wanted a stronger signal,"" says Kristen Umstattd, a local official, referring to the station owners. A former CIA analyst who has studied in Taiwan, she says that last year the station owners received permission to expand their programming hours. A station engineer says they now broadcast 24 hours a day. ""I hope somebody above my pay grade is paying attention,"" Umstattd says. WCRW, once located in this building, is now known as China Radio Washington The radio signal is powerful. On a recent Sunday, listeners in Washington learned about Chinese satellites hurling through space and other achievements of the Beijing government. In contrast the news bulletins, which are produced by China Radio International, tended to strike an ominous tone when reporting on the US economy. In addition, Chinese officials broadcast news bulletins in Philadelphia, Atlanta and other cities, according to Reuters. The programming of WCRW and the other stations, according to the report, Chinese Influence and American Interests, are part of what is known as the Grand External Propaganda Campaign. Chinese broadcasters say on the station that they're offering listeners in the area ""perspective"" and ""commentary"" on news and current events so that people in the US can ""learn what China is thinking and saying"". For the Chinese agents, Mallory was a catch. He has dark brown hair, a broad smile and an easy-going manner, and he does not drink alcohol or coffee. He had worked as a covert CIA officer and held security clearances that gave him access to the nation's most valuable secrets. By the time he was approached by the Chinese in early 2017, though, he was working as an independent consultant and was struggling to make ends meet. Randall Phillips, an investigator with the Mintz Group, previously served as the CIA's chief representative in China. Speaking on the phone from Shanghai, he says the Chinese agents tried to make Mallory feel special. ""They played with the guy's vanity,"" says Phillips. It's a time-honoured technique often joked about. ""I keep waiting for the honey trap,"" one CIA official said recently in a Washington bar. The Chinese agents approached Mallory not in a bar but on LinkedIn, saying in a casual way: ""Hey, will you join my network?'"" According to court records. Mallory replied: ""I'm open to whatever. I've got to - you know - pay the bills."" Mallory lived next to a golf course They told him they were looking for someone with his professional background, the same ploy they had used on European members of parliament, according to theGerman domestic intelligence service,external. A German official says that the Chinese agents have become more perfidious on LinkedIn over the past year. Paul Rockwell, LinkedIn's head of trust and safety department, says they're concerned about therecruitment efforts of Chinese agents,external: ""We are committed to stopping this behaviour."" Beijing officials dispute the Germans' account, calling it ""groundless"". Mallory, one of nine children, graduated from university in Utah with a political science degree and spent time in the military before working as a CIA operative. He lived in Iraq, China and Taiwan and married Mariah Nan Hua in Taipei. In 2006, they bought their house in Raspberry Falls for $1.16m, with their three children, an adopted Alaskan malamute-style puppy Misty and another husky, Sierra. Mallory and his wife spoke Chinese at home, a place decorated with brightly coloured throw pillows, a framed picture of a Mormon tabernacle and a rice cooker resting on a kitchen counter. His own life reflected the way Americans and native Chinese speakers have come together in northern Virginia over the years. About 14% of the population in Loudon County is Asian American, ,according tocensus data,external. On Sundays Mallory and his wife would head to church, where he was known as Zhiping Mao. Many of their friends at church are native Chinese speakers - they sing lyrics in Chinese (you can follow the English-language version in a hymnbook) in a back room. Leesburg has several Chinese businesses Others at the church have a similar background to Mallory. Fluent in Chinese, these middle-aged men work for the CIA or other intelligence agencies. As one of Mallory's friends commented, ""You can't swing a dead cat without hitting someone with a security clearance."" Mallory used to remind people in Raspberry Falls how lucky they are. ""He'd say: 'You're living the American dream,"" recalls a family friend. ""He'd tell people they should appreciate what they have."" Another friend, Delrose Winter, recalls a day when Mallory and his family came over for a Fourth of July barbecue. They wore red, white and blue on that Independence Day and seemed ""very patriotic"", she says. But after the 2008 real estate crash, his fortunes changed. His house plummeted in value, and later he lost his job. A scientist who lives nearby, says: ""They were under severe financial stress."" Another neighbour says: ""They were under water"", adding: ""That contributed to his desperation."" Mallory struggled to support his family in Raspberry Falls By the time the Chinese agents got in touch with Mallory, he had $30,000 in credit card debt, according to court records, and was behind in his mortgage payments. His new acquaintance on LinkedIn introduced him to someone who worked for the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, a think-tank that provides offices for scholars and cover for intelligence agents. He offered Mallory a position as a consultant. Mallory flew to Shanghai and met his new bosses in a hotel room. These men did not say they worked for the intelligence agency, but they did not deny it either. During that meeting, the hair on Mallory's neck stood up, he later said. He had agreed to take their money, though. ""They get you to cross a line,"" says Phillips, the former CIA officer. ""Once you do, it's harder to get out."" Mallory returned to Leesburg with a Samsung Galaxy phone the Chinese had given him - complete with a chat application by which they communicated with him. That phone later proved to be his downfall. When he got home, he told his wife he had concerns about his new job. Despite his reservations, though, he provided the Chinese with information he had obtained while working in the US intelligence services. According to US officials, some of the material that he gave to the Chinese was classified. Mallory said that the agents told him: ""We just want to understand what Trump administration policy is going to be."" He told the Chinese he had applied for a job in the White House, and they encouraged his efforts. The agents also prodded him for information about missile defence systems and other sensitive issues. Mallory placed classified material on a Toshiba SD card, shown above But then things got really complicated for Mallory. He texted a CIA resource officer and a covert operative, both of whom attended his church, and said he was hoping to speak to someone in the CIA's East Asia division. He said later he was looking to tell the CIA what he was learning about the Chinese agents - effectively becoming a double agent. These text messages began to take on a frantic tone. Psychiatrist David Charney who has interviewed several convicted spies, says they realise at a certain point they ""can never go home"", which can lead to deep apprehension and terror. Mallory placed classified material that he had obtained during the time that he worked for US intelligence agencies on a Toshiba SD card, wrapping it in tinfoil and stashing in his bedroom closet. He told the Chinese agents he was worried that US authorities would discover his subterfuge: ""If they were looking for me in terms of state secrets and found the SD card we would not be talking today."" Mallory's lawyers said that he did nothing wrong. They said he was simply collecting information about Chinese espionage so he could inform the CIA about Beijing's methods. He hoped to impress the CIA with his knowledge of Chinese tradecraft so the CIA would hire him back. But prosecutors presented text messages in court as evidence that he was selling US secrets: ""Your object is to gain information,"" he texted the Chinese agents. ""My object is to be paid."" Mallory arranged to meet with a CIA official in an Ashburn hotel in May 2017. Mallory's lawyers said that he was planning to show off his knowledge of the Chinese espionage techniques. The prosecutors said Mallory wanted to speak with the CIA officials not to impress them with his knowledge but because he wanted to cover his tracks. Mallory was clearly surprised when an FBI special agent also showed up for the meeting, as prosecutors later showed in court. The presence of the FBI agent showed that federal investigators were interested in Mallory. Still he carried on as if everything was fine. He described the way the Chinese had provided him with a secure phone. At this point, he assumed that his text messages would remain encrypted. Mallory texted the Chinese agents on a Samsung Galaxy that they gave him But as he spoke, the phone crashed. The messages suddenly appeared on the phone's screen while he was in the room with the FBI, revealing how he had betrayed his country. For a long moment he said nothing. James Hamrock, an engineer who examined the phone for the FBI, says that Mallory was overly trusting of the phone and of the people who gave it to him. Unbeknownst to Mallory, the software had a glitch. Two of the counts, both relating to where he had committed the crimes, have been dropped. The government is trying to get the charges reinstated. These two charges do not affect his sentence, however: life in prison. Mallory wrecked his own life and cast suspicion on others. Many of the native Chinese speakers who live in Loudoun County are angry. ""We're American first,"" says Taiwan-born Eiling Chao, who runs her own company, Choice Insurance Network, with her daughter, Stephanie Chao, and other family members. ""If there's any spying action happening, I certainly hope the person gets punished to the fullest."" Eiling Chao, shown with Stephanie, says the US should fight hard against espionage US officials have studied the crime of espionage, creating an acronym that establishes motives: MICE (money, ideology, compromise and ego). It's true that Mallory wanted to make money from the Chinese, but in the end it was not much: he earned $25,000 USD from his spy work. Mallory's house is now on the market: a short sale, it's listed at $740,000 and has lost more than a third of its value. The Chinese banner has been taken down. Misty and Sierra still lie on a patch of woodchips in the yard on sunny afternoons. They barely look up when a mailman comes. Mallory is being held in the Alexandria Detention Center in Virginia, and he is waiting for his sentencing. He was in the courtroom on an autumn morning, and he wore Velcro sneakers, white socks and a prison jumpsuit, and his face was ashen. During a phone call to his daughter from jail, he tried to explain why he had been arrested. ""Your mom knows I've been all up front with all this kind of stuff with the CIA,"" he said and, referring to the FBI agents, said: ""Somehow these other guys twisted things around a little bit."" He said: ""Things get complicated sometimes."" The jury wrote a note to the judge, stating their verdict His friend Kevin McLane worked with him in Iraq and says that he is innocent. ""He thought he was doing something good for the United States,"" says McLane. ""Was he naÃ¯ve? Probably. A little bit stupid? Probably. Was he trying to hurt the United States? Absolutely not."" Mallory's wife, ""an absolute rock"", as a friend describes her, is now driving a school bus. Jeremiah leads the church group in prayer and has the grace that comes from years of studying ballet. He is getting ready to go on a two-year missionary in Australia, following his brother, Michael, 22, who is there now. Jeremiah wrote to the court in October and asked if he could hug his father before he leaves: ""It would be an unforgettable blessing to have a last moment with my Dad."" Many of the Americans who have committed treason were once model citizens who went into a downward spiral and thought espionage would help them turn things around. Behind bars they still see themselves as patriotic, says David Charney, the psychiatrist. That seems to be true with Mallory: he calls his friend Patsy Clark from jail, and she says he remains loyal to the US. ""They were never hating the US,"" Charney said in a Washingtonlecture,external: ""Their only beef was with themselves."" He added: ""Weirdly enough, they're still good Americans.""

"The ""Blue Whale challenge"" was reported to be an online ""suicide game"" aimed at teenagers which set 50 tasks over 50 days. The challenge was alleged to be linked to numerous deaths around the world. But little about the ""game"" was quite as it seemed. The first tasks were fairly innocuous: ""Wake up in the middle of the night"" or ""Watch a scary film"". But day by day, the tasks grew more sinister. ""Stand on the ledge of a tower block."" ""Cut a whale into your arm."" The final challenge? A demand that the user kill themselves. The challenge was alleged to have started in Russia, but reports of it soon spread to other countries:Ukraine,Indiaand theUnited States. Hundreds of deaths were reported to be linked to the so-called ""suicide game"". But closer investigation has revealed something curious. The game, at least as it was initially reported, doesn't seem to have existed at all. The story of the Blue Whale challenge began with Rina Palenkova. On 22 November 2015, Rina, a teenager living in south-eastern Russia, posted a selfie. In the photo she is standing outside. A black scarf is wrapped around her mouth and nose. She is sticking her middle finger up at the camera. It looks like it's covered in dried blood. The photo's caption read: ""Nya bye"". The next day, she took her own life. Russian girl's suicide prompts national debate Is this woman's 'manspreading' video a Kremlin hoax? What is it like to prevent a suicide? The memes that might get you jailed in Russia Rina Palenkova's death was discussed in a certain type of chat room hosted by Russia's largest social network VKontakte. These forums were places where teenagers met to talk about everyday things like school and which classmates they fancied, as well as darker subject matter: depression, loneliness and suicide. Scary stories were exchanged. The spookiness of these stories came from how real they seemed, something often achieved through fake pictures or doctored footage. It is the online equivalent of the claim made by classic horror films that they are ""based on true events"". Because at the heart of any good ghost story is a sliver of plausibility. It was in these groups, where the line between fact and fiction was often blurred, that users posted feverishly about Rina. In some instances, they lauded her for ending her life. Videos purporting to be her final moments were posted online. But amid the rumours, there was a problem. ""Nobody actually knew the true story behind her suicide,"" says Daria Radchenko, a senior researcher at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration who has looked into the so-called Blue Whale challenge. And shortly thereafter, Rina's story merged with other stories of teenage suicide. On Christmas Day 2015, 12-year-old Angelina Davydova killed herself in the Russian city of Ryazan. A little over a fortnight later, so did Diana Kuznetsova, a teenager from the same city. When the parents examined the online accounts left behind by their daughters, they found something curious - the two girls were part of similar online groups. In these groups were drawings of Rina Palenkova, posts about suicide and numerous mentions of blue whales. There has been much speculation about how whales became linked to suicide in these groups. Some journalists claim it is because whales have been known to beach themselves, a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists. Others say that it is a reference to lyrics from a Russian rock band named Lumen. It's difficult, of course, to say why certain images particularly resonate. Whales are solitary-seeming, sad-looking animals. They make for good memes. One of the most widely shared images was of a whale flying over a city at night. It captured the spirit of these groups - melancholy and quietly surreal. But it wasn't until May 2016 that speculation about blue whales and suicide became part of the national conversation in Russia. An article by journalist Galina Mursalieva in Novaya Gazeta, an investigative newspaper, sent the story into overdrive. Mursalieva suggested that inside certain online groups, some of them with enigmatic names like ""Ocean Whales"" and ""f57"", existed a game. In this game, so-called ""curators"" would set players 50 tasks over 50 days. On the last day the user was instructed to take their own life. The Novaya Gazeta report estimated that 130 children might have killed themselves between November 2015 and April 2016 because of their participation in these groups. It would come to be known worldwide as the Blue Whale challenge. It did not take long for the story to cause considerable alarm. The governor for Ulyanovsk in western Russia went on television to compare the Blue Whale challenge to the Islamic State group. Soon the panic spread outside Russia. In Georgia, US, a 16-year-old girl killed herself. It was only later when her family had learned about the Blue Whale challenge that they realised the significance of the metre-high paintings she had finished at school shortly before she died. They appeared to be of blue whales. Then came other suicides: a boy named Isaiah Gonzalez, also in the United States, a 19-year-old in Hyderabad in India, and two Russian girls, Yulia Konstantinova and Veronika Volkova. A few days before she died, Konstantinova had posted an image of a blue whale on her Instagram account. In November 2016, 21-year-old Philipp Budeikin was arrested, charged with inciting teenagers to suicide. Budeikin appeared to admit culpability. He told Russian media outletSaint-Petersburg.ru:,external""There are people, and then there is biodegradable waste. I was cleansing our society of such people. Sometimes I start to think that it's wrong, but in the end I had the feeling I was doing the right thing."" He liked computers and was an aspiring producer of ""witch house"", an electronic music genre with occult themes. A former psychology student, the impression given by the media was that he had used highly developed tactics to manipulate teenagers into killing themselves. He said he had created the game in 2013 under the name ""f57"", combining the sound of the start of his name, Philipp, and the last two digits of his phone number. On 10 May 2017 he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison. It seemed like an open-and-shut case. Further investigation, however, has revealed that little about the Blue Whale challenge was quite as straightforward as it seemed. Evgeny Berg was on his way to work when he first read about the Vkontakte chat rooms. ""It made a strong impression on me. It was May but it was very gloomy. I thought 'Oh my God, there is a man out there who is trying to kill a lot of children in Russia.' And I felt shivers on my skin."" Berg, an investigative journalist at Meduza, a Russian-language independent media organisation, decided to dig deeper. His research took him to Sergey Pestov, the father of one of the girls who died around Christmas 2015. Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external After his daughter's death, Pestov and his wife founded an organisation called Saving Children from Cybercrime. They produced a brochure. It implied that foreign intelligence might be to blame for their daughter's death and that operatives were destroying the Russian people by inciting their children to suicide. Pestov became a key source of statistics for the original Novaya Gazeta piece. ""He used media sources and open sources to count a bunch of cases all over Russia which were, in his opinion, connected with suicide groups,"" says Evgeny Berg. ""And this number was 130."" This is the same number that was first quoted in the Novaya Gazeta piece. ""So that's where the number started"" says Berg, ""with the father of a girl who tragically died at the end of 2015."" In a story shrouded in rumour and hearsay, this 130 figure is one of the very few widely reported ""facts"". But even though it is still being used by many news outlets, the figure is tenuous. According to Evgeny Berg and Meduza, it originates with a parent trying to unravel the reasons behind a personal tragedy. The Novaya Gazeta article has been viewed over one and a half million times, according to the paper. More from BBC Trending Download our podcast - from the BBC World Service We took Evgeny Berg's allegations - that the foundations of the Novaya Gazeta article were, at best, unsteady - directly to the reporter, Galina Mursalieva. She rejected the claim that her report relied on a single flawed statistic. ""This number 130 wasn't based on the conclusions of one father who lost his child,"" says Mursalieva. ""No. This is absolutely wrong. It was based on the conclusions of over 200 parents who lost their children. The father of the girl who died just helped during that period of time. I don't have any reason not to trust them. I checked many things."" Mursalieva had worked on the story for months and included interviews with the parents of deceased children and experts in law and psychology. She says she published it because she wanted to spur into action investigators who she thought weren't taking the problem seriously enough. But despite the considerable column inches dedicated to the ""challenge"" over the years, not a single suicide has so far been proved to be linked to these groups, neither by journalists nor police. ""There have actually been way more than 130 cases,"" claims Mursalieva. ""But tell me - who could confirm that this happened? How can it be confirmed?"" That seems to be the crux of it. How can the cause of a suicide ever be ""proved""? It might be more accurate to say that teenagers suffering from depression, some of them suicidal, could be drawn to groups that deal with that topic. These same children may use similar images, like blue whales, to articulate their feelings online. With its surreal memes and creepy stories that blur fact and fiction, the subculture of teenage messaging boards is easy for adults to misinterpret. It is possible that journalists and concerned parents accessed these groups and brought together disparate elements into a story that wasn't really there. That reading tallies with the findings of Alexandra Arkhipova, a professor in Folklore Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities. When she and her colleagues entered the online groups alleged to be connected with the Blue Whale challenge, they found something strange. ""All of these 'curators',"" says Arkhipova, ""turned out to be children aged 12 to 14."" Far from being manipulative adults, all the curators seemed to be just kids who had read or heard about the game. In fact, Arkhipova's research suggests that the ""challenge"" might not have really existed in any substantial way before the Novaya Gazeta article was published. Arkhipova says that the ""curators"" she came across online were copycats, acting out step by step the parts of a game that was being widely reported in the press. ""In all these groups people, mainly young people, were waiting for this game,"" says Arkhipova. ""This game never starts."" But where does that leave the story of Philipp Budeikin, the man who confessed to creating the game? Oddly, it might have something to do with his music career. Friends of Budeikin, speaking to the investigative journalist Evgeny Berg, disputed the claim that he is an evil mastermind. In fact, they say that he filled online groups with ""shock"" content related to Rina Palenkova and suicide in order to get as many followers as possible - and then advertise his music. It is a common practice on VKontakte, where people exploit access to a large amount of followers to advertise other projects or sell products. When Budeikin was arrested, there were 15 charges against him. By the following month, all but one had collapsed. The truth at the heart of the Blue Whale challenge is surely both more sad and more mundane than the breathless articles might have us believe. Russia's suicide rates are high especially among the young. It has one of the highest rates ofadolescent suicide,externalin the world. Yes, some teenagers appear to have been drawn into online forums where suicide was being discussed. And in those forums, blue whale memes were being shared. But the idea of a sinister game, one that slowly roped in vulnerable teens and led them down an increasingly tortured path to suicide, seems to be a simplistic explanation for a complex problem. There is no silver bullet for tackling suicide amongst teenagers. Nor is there a bogeyman that can be locked up to prevent it. Do you have a story for us?Email BBC Trending,external.

"The government'sclean air strategy,external, which was published on Monday, describes reducing pollution from nitrogen oxides (NOx) as its most immediate challenge. NOx emissions come mainly from diesel vehicles. Much of the strategy on road transport had been announced previously, including the pledge from July to stop all sales of new conventional petrol or diesel powered cars and vans by 2040. But it devolves responsibility for reducing NOx emissions mainly to a local level, mentioning measures planned by the mayor of London. On 8 April this year,London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ),externalwill come into force, requiring some motorists to pay Â£12.50 a day to drive into the existing congestion charging zone, on top of the current Â£11.50 charge. The charge will apply to drivers of petrol cars that do not meet the Euro 4 emission standards only, which generally means cars registered before 2005. But diesel owners will have to pay if their cars do not meet the Euro 6 standard, which generally means anything registered before September 2015.You can check whether your car will be affected here,external. In October 2021, the ULEZ will expand to cover all roads inside the North Circular and South Circular. BBC Reality Check examined whether diesel cars were more harmful than petrol oneslast year. While many owners feel they were encouraged to buy diesel cars because of their lower CO2 emissions, they are now being discouraged because of their emissions of oxides of nitrogen. Registrations of new diesel cars fell 30% last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Overall, registrations were down7% from 2017 levels. It means that 32% of new cars registered in 2018 were diesel-powered, down from about 50% five years ago. If you are an owner of an older diesel, what can you do? Some of the action against diesel vehicles was taken after it emerged, in 2015, thatsoftware used to cheat emissions testshad been built into millions of Volkswagen diesel cars. VW has made modifications to affected vehicles in the UK but has not offered any compensation. Various class-action lawsuits are under way, claiming that the performance and resale value has been affected. The government considered funding a scrappage scheme to encourage owners to replace older, more polluting cars with new ones. It might have been similar to the one introduced in the 2009 Budget, which offered owners of cars more than 10 years old Â£2,000 towards a new car if they scrapped their old one and which finished at the end of March 2010. But in the end, the government decided not to bring in a national scrappage scheme. It does currently have asubsidy scheme for plug-in electric cars,external, which covers up to one-third of the purchase price to a maximum of Â£3,500, but it does not require old vehicles to be scrapped. Several car manufacturers run their own scrappage schemes, offering customers money off new vehicles if they trade-in old ones. Some of them will accept only diesel vehicles, although some will also accept petrol cars. It tends to depend on the age of the car, its emissions, how long you have owned it and which new car you are planning to buy. Better news for owners of diesel-powered cars is that they have held up much better in the second-hand market. Sales have continued strongly since 2015, according to figures from the SMMT. ""Generally, used-car buyers are far less concerned with issues surrounding diesel than their new-car counterparts,"" said Derren Martin, head of UK valuations at cap hpi. ""The fuel economy and torque that diesel continues to offer, alongside the lower [vehicle excise duty] for cars registered before 1 April 2017, means that they continue to be an attractive proposition for many."" The chart above shows how second hand prices have changed. For example, a three-year-old diesel car - that's one with a 2016 registration plate - sells for more than a similar three-year-old diesel car did a year ago. The increasing prices for second hand diesel cars since last summer is quite unusual. Cap hpi, an automotive data provider, expects depreciation of between about 3% and 5% in this figure. And while it has been a very strong year for all used-car prices, it now expects prices to return to that sort of depreciation. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Theresa May needs to become a mediator to help break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament, former prime minister John Major has said. He wants MPs to be given a vote on all Brexit options, indicating their preference on the way forward. Mrs May should consider dropping her red lines ""in the national interest"" and become a facilitator to find out what Parliament wants, he said. Tory Brexit supporter Suella Braverman dismissed his ""Remainer elite"" views. She said: ""Thank you Sir John, but no thanks."" Liam Fox yet to seal no-deal trade agreements Boles: Ministers back 'block no-deal plan' Where Tory tribes stand on Brexit Meanwhile, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has said there are ""in reality, just two remaining options"" for Brexit - to instruct the government to negotiate a close relationship with the EU, including a customs union, or for there to be a public vote. He told the Fabian Society conference in London that it ""seems inevitable"" the government will have to apply for an extension to Article 50. Labour has responsibility ""in this moment of national crisis"" to ""offer a constructive path forward"", said Sir Keir, adding that there are ""no easy routes out of this mess"". ""It's now time for an open and frank debate about how we break the deadlock,"" he said. It comes after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet Mrs May for talks to discuss a way forward, unless she takes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Sir Keir also said what Mrs May is doing is ""not resilient, but reckless"", and that she was ""ploughing on without a plan"" and ""reducing the time for a credible alternative to emerge"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Sir John warned that no deal would be the ""worst of all outcomes"". He said that ""millions of people"" - both individuals and businesses - would be hurt in such a scenario. ""Tinkering"" with her deal will not make a difference to the current situation, he added. By Nick Eardley, political correspondent Westminster is currently stuck on what happens next with Brexit. There are a range of different views in Parliament, but no certainty that any of them would command majority support. Indicative votes are a proposed solution. MPs would be given a free vote on various proposals, from a second referendum to a customs union to a free trade agreement. The idea goes that this would allow MPs to express what they really think, free from party commitments. It could, proponents believe, end the log-jam. But as we've documented at length in recent weeks, there is no guarantee it would. One thing is certain just now; a lot of work still needs to be done if a consensus is to be found. Sir John said the prime minister had been ""handed a poisoned chalice"" and that things had been ""extremely difficult"" for her. ""Her position has been all but impossible,"" he said, adding that Parliament was ""running out of time"". If Mrs May does not drop her red lines ""in the national interest"", then her options are either for the Cabinet or Parliament to decide or for there to be another referendum ""now more facts are known than were known in 2016"", Sir John argued. He said while Cabinet is too split to reach an agreement, there is hope that Parliament could reach a consensus, with Mrs May as a mediator. Please upgrade your browser He told the programme: ""The prime minister argued valiantly for her deal. She fought for it but the House of Commons killed it and killed it comprehensively. ""The prime minister still needs a deal. If she can't deliver one that Parliament accepts, then she needs to become a facilitator, a mediator, to find out what Parliament will accept."" Ideally, all party leaders would give their MPs a free vote to allow an ""honest representation"" of opinion. He called for compromise to prevent any further splits, as ""no one is going to get their way"". It is now very unlikely we will leave the EU on 29 March ""bar a miracle"", he added, arguing that a delay would be ""wise"". Mrs Braverman said some of the options being put forward - including a customs union, allowing continued free movement of people or holding another referendum - would be ""clear breaches"" of promises made by Mrs May, and ignore the will of the people. She has also called for the Irish border backstop - the position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - to be scrapped.
