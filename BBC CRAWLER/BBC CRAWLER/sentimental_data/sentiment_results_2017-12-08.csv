"Stormzy made the transition from underground success to household name in 2017 Stormzy has been named artist of the year at the 2017 BBC Music Awards, capping a hugely successful year. The south London MC, whose debut album Gang Signs & Prayer was the first grime record to reach number one, beat Ed Sheeran and Lorde to the prize. He adds it to a collection that already includes three Mobos and the Q Award for best solo artist. Rag N Bone Man collected album of the year, while Foo Fighters won best live performance for their Glastonbury set. This video can not be played Highlights of Foo Fighters' set at Glastonbury 2017 The US band headlined the festival this June, two years after they were forced to pull out when frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. Taking to the stage this summer, Grohl blamed the delay on ""bad traffic"", before launching into a blistering, hit-filled set. Their performance eventually overran by 20 minutes because the crowd kept singing between songs. Foo Fighters finally headline Glastonbury Stormzy: Seven things you need to know Rag N Bone Man interview (BBC Sound of 2017) Declan McKenna wins BBC Introducing prize ""It really did just turn into this one big ball of love and energy and celebration and music,"" Grohl said as he collected the BBC Music Award. ""That's what you want every show to be, but when it's on that scale it's a big feeling."" This year's BBC Music Award winners pose with their trophies Rag N Bone Man's prize came in recognition of his debut album Human, which is the year's biggest-selling debut. ""That's a proper good award,"" he said. ""I keep thinking at one point that someone is going to fishhook me off and tell me it's a joke, but it's not, and it's a wonderful thing to have."" In previous years, the BBC Music Awards have been handed out at a glitzy televised arena concert, with performances from the likes of One Direction, Little Mix and Robbie Williams. However, after disappointing ratings (2016's show was watched by 2.7 million people) this year's awards were handed out during a a one-hour BBC Two special titledThe Year In Music 2017.

"The mesh is made of a type of plastic and surgeons routinely use it in hernia repairs Banning vaginal mesh implants would remove an important treatment for some women suffering from a prolapse, says the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Some women benefit from the implants and should have a choice, it said. The health watchdog NICE is expected torecommend that the implants be banned. Around 800 women are taking legal action against the NHS and mesh manufacturers, saying they have suffered from painful complications. When a prolapse occurs, doctors sometimes insert a mesh into the wall of the vagina to act as scaffolding to support organs - such as the uterus, bowel and bladder - which have fallen out of place. Hundreds of women have reported problems with this plastic mesh, which is made of polypropylene. Prof Linda Cordozo says banning vaginal mesh is not a good idea However another smaller device made from the same material, called a tape, which is used to stem the flow of urine from a leaking bladder, has a much lower risk of complications. Prof Linda Cardozo, a surgeon at King's College Hospital in London, said there was a misconception that all types of mesh were a problem. She explained that she was not in favour of banning the use of mesh for prolapses. ""I don't think a total ban on anything is a good idea. It stifles the opportunity to offer the minority something that might benefit them,"" she said. Draft guidelines from NICE say the implants should only be used for research - and not routine operations. But Prof Cardozo said that a ban would stop any further research as well. ""If mesh is banned, there will be no more clinical trials,"" said the professor. ""Banning it is a retrograde step - we will go back to how we were a century ago when we couldn't offer women a range of options."" Prof Cardozo pointed out that artificial hips and knees were not perfect when they were first introduced, but thanks to further research and progress they ended up improving lives. ""We need to be very careful that [mesh] is used in the right women by the right doctors... who have explained the risk-benefit ratio and all other types of treatment,"" she added. Some doctors did not have the skills or training to put in vaginal meshes, and the devices have been overused, the professor has argued. She also said the debate over vaginal mesh was making some women who had had surgery unnecessarily anxious. ""They are panicking because they believe something terrible may be happening inside their body as a result of tape or mesh, but most women are problem-free,"" said Prof Cardozo. Kathryn Taylor says her mesh implant has improved her life Kathryn Taylor was just 35 when she suffered her first prolapse. She was later diagnosed with a condition that had weakened the muscles around her uterus and bowel. Last year she had a second vaginal mesh implant to help keep those organs in place. ""Mesh isn't right for everyone, but it's totally changed my life for the better,"" Kathryn said. ""Without it I wouldn't be able to work and lead a normal life. ""I'd have to have a colostomy bag attached to my leg,"" she explained. Stephanie Williams is waiting to have her mesh implant removed after being left in constant pain However campaigners, like Stephanie Williams, are protesting against all types of vaginal mesh and tape. They are calling for more research into the types of mesh products used and their longer-term effects. They say women have not been given the full facts about the possible side effects. In her own case, Stephanie says she didn't realise she was having a vaginal mesh implant and it has left her in constant pain. ""The word mesh was never mentioned,"" she said. ""I would not have even known what mesh meant at the time and if it was mentioned beforehand we would have looked into it before,"" she added. She is now waiting to have her mesh removed. John Wilkinson, the director of devices at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority and we recognise some women do develop serious complications which can be very significant for the affected women."" ""We also know many women gain benefit from these surgical procedures for what can be extremely debilitating conditions,"" he added. Mr Wilkinson encouraged patients and doctors to report any complications linked with the mesh implants through theYellow Card scheme.,external The NHS has always insisted that the vast majority of procedures using mesh are a success and many women have benefitted from surgery. The health watchdog - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - is due to make its final recommendations next week. Companies in the US have already paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to patients.

"Phil Davies complained about how Northern dealt with passengers on his journey and later took them to court after they failed to reply A train passenger's lengthy fight for compensation from a rail company got to the stage where bailiffs were ""pursuing them at their registered office"". Phil Davies was on a Leeds to Barnsley service which ""abandoned"" him and 40 other passengers in Wakefield due to a signal failure. He claimed for compensation and won a legal case, but said he was left waiting for about Â£300 from Northern. Northern apologised and said the ""matter had been resolved"". On an evening train on 10 June, Mr Davies was travelling to his home in Barnsley when the line suffered signal problems. The passenger said they were left on the platform of Wakefield Westgate with no access to toilets, with a promise of a Northern representative arranging their onward journey not kept. British Transport Police eventually advised passengers to walk into Wakefield and find a taxi. Mr Davies said he complained, but was still waiting for a response after four weeks so began a small claims court case against the company. In October, a court ruled in favour of his claim for Â£283 plus Â£25 court fees, as Northern did not attend the hearing. After two weeks, Mr Davies said the bailiffs ""automatically stepped in"" as no payment had been made. ""It's frustrating when a big corporation just snubs a consumer - we're small and insignificant."" Mr Davies said. ""Too often, the public are fobbed off by big corporations and they simply can't be bothered. It's about challenging poor standards so they're improved."" Northern said it was reviewing its procedures after the legal wrangle A spokesman for Northern said: ""We apologise for any distress and frustration experienced by our customer following the incident and his subsequent contact with Northern. ""We fully accept the judgement of the court and have made contact to ensure the matter is settled. We have also made a significant offer of compensation to our customer  - which is over and above the figure set out by the court."" He added: ""We are now undertaking a review of our processes to help ensure such situations do not happen again.""

"Sadik Kamara (left) and Joshua Jordan were part of a gang of five who targeted the women Two robbers who laughed after spraying women in their faces with cleaning fluid have been jailed for 10 years. Rapper Sadik Kamara, 24, known as Trizzy Trapz, and Joshua Jordan, 20, both of Newham, east London, used the ammonia to target ""petite women"" who would not be able to fight back. Judge John Dodd QC jailed them for the ""horrifying, cruel and barbaric"" crimes which he said were ""gratuitous"". Both women they attacked suffered facial burns but were not disfigured. Prosecutor Benn Maguire told the Old Bailey how the defendants were among a gang of five who set out to deliberately target ""petite women"" to rob on 10 March. ""During the robbery and undoubtedly to instil fear in the minds of their victims, the attackers sprayed ammonia into the faces of their victims,"" he said. ""Any attempt to shout for help has resulted in ammonia being sprayed into the open mouths of the female victims - cowardly in the extreme."" The pair were previously found guilty of using the corrosive fluid with intent to injure or cause grievous bodily harm. They were also convicted of robbery and attempted robbery. Jailing Kamara and Jordan for 10 years with four years on extended licence, the judge said: ""These are dreadful and shocking offences. You chose to rob women who would have stood no chance against you, a gang of five men. ""Even if you were unarmed, you still chose to take ammonia with you and use it against two slight women."" In one attack in Hackney, shopkeeper Quyen Bei, 51, fought off the raiders. Four men with faces covered were captured on CCTV as they entered the store wearing hoods and gloves. The pair were sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday During the attempted robbery, Kamara squirted ammonia in Mrs Bei's face at least three times. The other robbers, including Jordan, struggled with Mrs Bei, who was punched to the ground and kicked. She managed to press the panic alarm despite suffering burns to her face. The gang fled empty-handed. About 10 minutes later, the defendants attacked a random woman in the street, the court heard. The pair forced Vietnamese Thi Le Nguyen, 49, to the ground and one pinned her face to the pavement while the other repeatedly sprayed her face with the cleaning fluid. They snatched her handbag and ran back to their getaway car laughing together. Bottles of household cleaner containing high-strength ammonia were found nearby, clearly marked with warnings it could cause ""severe skin burns and blindness"". Following sentencing, Det Con Ben Kahane said: ""The level of violence used was completely disproportionate. ""The witness testimony describing how two of the suspects ran off laughing I think sums up the callous enjoyment the gang felt in targeting their victims.""

A Europe-wide appeal to help Charlie Douthwaite - who was born with heart defect - was launched last month and he underwent a transplant last week. But his father Steven Douthwaite has posted on Facebook that Charlie has had a ""rough few days"" and may be rejecting the new heart. Charlie, who hashypoplastic left heart syndrome,external, was the youngest patient on the UK transplant waiting list. After his nine-hour operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, Charlie's mother, Tracie Wright, said the donor family had given him ""a second chance at life"". Mr Douthwaite said on Facebook,externalCharlie's blood pressure had dropped and medics suspected he had sepsis. 'On edge' He also said his son had had to undergo open heart surgery again. The post said: ""Charlie has had a rough few days - we were told this could be the first stage of his body rejecting the heart, we also found out that they believe Charlie has caught sepsis so they have started him on antibiotics. ""Terrible feeling being told that his body might of been rejecting the heart, not nice living every second of your life on edge.""

"Some motorists said they were stuck on the closed motorway for more than four hours Drivers were left stuck in vehicles for several hours in freezing temperatures as the M5 was shut in both directions. It followed ""concerns for the welfare of a man"" on a bridge at junction 28, near Cullompton, at about 16:00 GMT, police said. Just after 20:40, Devon and Cornwall Police said the man had been moved from the bridge and the road was reopening. Richard Jones, said his wife and eight-week old baby were among those stuck in traffic in a ""very cold Skoda"". The closure caused traffic jams stretching back for seven miles (11km) from the bridge, in mid-Devon. Highways England confirmed the motorway was ""fully open"" at 21:43 after work to move broken down vehicles. Many people were stranded in their cars for hours and some posted on social media to say they risked running out of fuel on the motorway. Forecasters had predicted temperatures in the areawould be going down to -1C during the night. Police said the road was reopening just after 20:40 GMT Sara Morgan-Broom, who was one of those stuck in the queues, said she had not moved on the motorway between 16:20 and 20:12.

"This video can not be played Tensions are high in wake of Donald Trump's Jerusalem announcement Violence has flared between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting at Donald Trump's contentious recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Clashes erupted in the occupied West Bank and over the Israeli-Gaza border, where one Palestinian was killed. Tensions are high in the wake ofMr Trump's announcement. His policy shift was hailed by Israel but condemned across the Arab and Islamic world. The UN's Middle East envoy warned of a risk the conflict would escalate. ""There is a serious risk today that we may see a chain of unilateral actions, which can only push us further away from achieving our shared goal of peace,"" Nickolay Mladenov told an emergency UN Security Council meeting, by videocall from Jerusalem. He called on all parties to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" and ""reign in radical elements"". While the meeting was going on, the Israeli army said it had intercepted a rocket launch from Gaza, but there had been ""no casualties and no damage"". Anger in the West Bank and delight in West Jerusalem Western allies of the US have disavowed Mr Trump's move, which reversed decades of US neutrality on the status of Jerusalem. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US became the first country to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital since the foundation of the state in 1948. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said it could take two years before the US embassy is relocated from Tel Aviv. In the West Bank, Israeli forces clashed with Palestinians in the cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah, Hebron and Nablus, as well as smaller locations. Television pictures from Bethlehem showed water cannon or so-called skunk water being used against stone-throwing protesters. This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace Clouds of tear gas and thick, black smoke from burning tyres filled the air. There were also reports of rubber bullets being fired by troops. Similar scenes were reported in other places where there were confrontations. Extra police were deployed in East Jerusalem ahead of the planned protests Israel had deployed extra battalions to the West Bank in anticipation of violence after Palestinian leaders called for protests after Friday prayers. In East Jerusalem there were scuffles as police pushed back hundreds of demonstrators outside the Old City. The ancient walled area, containing contentious holy sites, is historically a flashpoint for violence. At least 217 Palestinians were wounded in the confrontations in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestinian medics said. A 30-year-old Palestinian was killed and dozens of others injured in Gaza after Israeli forces opened fire after protesters threw stones at army posts on the border. Trump's speech in full Media reacts to 'slap of the century' Five key takeaways from speech Elsewhere, demonstrations against Mr Trump's announcement have spread. This video can not be played We hear from BBC reporters at protests in Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters held noisy demonstrations in Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Tunisia and Iran. Further afield, protesters rallied in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indian-administered Kashmir and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. There has been widespread denunciation of Mr Trump's move, especially in the Muslim world.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Mr Trump's announcement was ""deplorable"" and a senior Palestinian official said US Vice President Mike Pence was ""not welcome in Palestine"" during a planned visit to the region later this month.

"This video can not be played People gathered in the Old City in Jerusalem The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has accused the UN of damaging the prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The organisation ""has outrageously been one of the world's foremost centres of hostility towards Israel"", she said. Mrs Haley was addressing an emergency meeting of the Security Council called after President Donald Trump's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. The move has been widely condemned and sparked clashes in the West Bank. Israel has carried out air strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip, injuring a number of people, after Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israeli territory. Two Palestinian men died after Israeli troops fired on crowds in Gaza during clashes earlier on Friday. This video can not be played US ambassador Nikki Haley calls UN hostile to Israel Tensions remain high across the Middle East afterMr Trump announced the US would recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of US neutrality on the matter. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Frank Gardner: Counter-terror efforts at risk? Mrs Haley said the decision ""recognises the obvious; that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel"". She said the US continued to be ""committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement"", and accused the UN of bias. ""Israel will never be, and never should be, bullied into an agreement by the United Nations or by any collection of countries that have proven their disregard for Israel's security."" This video can not be played BBC reporters in Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan convey the public mood The Palestinian representative, Riyad Mansour, said Mr Trump's move meant the US could no longer be seen as a broker of peace. ""Complicity must be recognised,"" he said. Israel's representative, Danny Danon, thanked the US for what he called ""a milestone for Israel, for peace, and for the world"". Also on Friday: Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians would not talk to the US until Mr Trump reversed his decision Both Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the highest Sunni Muslim authority in the world, the imam of al-Azhar mosque in Egypt, said they would not meet US Vice President Mike Pence when he visited the Middle East later this month US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it could take two years before the US embassy was relocated from Tel Aviv The Israeli army said a rocket had hit the town of Sderot in southern Israel, but did not say whether anyone had been injured Israeli aircraft attacked Hamas military facilities in Gaza in retaliation, the Israeli army said, and the area's hospital said 14 people were wounded In the West Bank, Israeli forces clashed with Palestinians in the cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah, Hebron and Nablus, as well as smaller locations. Israel had deployed extra battalions to the West Bank in anticipation of violence after Palestinian leaders called for protests after Friday prayers. At least 217 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestinian medics said. Elsewhere, demonstrations against Mr Trump's announcement have spread. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters held noisy demonstrations in Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Tunisia and Iran. Further afield, protesters rallied in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indian-administered Kashmir and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country.

"NiceHash was targeted by hackers in the early hours of Wednesday ""Highly professional"" hackers made off with around 4,700 Bitcoin from a leading mining service, a Bitcoin exchange has said. The value of Bitcoin is currently extremely volatile, but at the time of writing, the amount stolen was worth approximately $80m. The hacked service was NiceHash, a Slovenia-based mining exchange. It said it was working hard to recover the Bitcoin for its users, adding: ""Someone really wanted to bring us down."" The attack happened early on Wednesday, said NiceHash's chief executive Marko Kobal. Attackers accessed the company's systems at 01:18 CET (00:18 GMT). By 03:37 the hackers, whom the company believes were based outside the European Union, had begun stealing Bitcoin. The theft comes as the price of Bitcoin continues to surge, dumbfounding experts and stoking concerns of a bubble. High-stakes attacks like this are not uncommon, with several large breaches and thefts hitting Bitcoin and other related services over the past year. NiceHash is a mining service, a company that pairs up people with spare computing power with those willing to pay to use it to mine for new Bitcoin. Mr Kobal appeared on Facebook Live to address concerns about the hack. ""We have not abandoned you guys,"" he said. He explained that an employee's computer was compromised in the attack. He added that ""forensic analysis"" involving local and international authorities was taking place, but did not expand on which specific agencies were involved when asked by the BBC. The company was heavily criticised by its users who commented in droves on Facebook. Communications were complicated further when a spoof Facebook page for the company was set up and spreading disinformation about the breach. Security issues involving Bitcoin and other related services are a frequent cause for concern for virtual currency traders. Other recent controversies involving digital currencies include: the firm behind digital currency Tether said that close to$31m (Â£23.4m) worth of its tokens were stolen a ""code bug"" inEthereum's digital walletsbeing blamed last month for freezing more than $150m worth of Ether, preventing investors from being able to cash out a South Korean exchange, Bithumb, saying that one of its employee's PCshad been hacked in June.

"The agreement commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic ""The test of a first-rate intelligence,"" F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in The Crack-Up, ""is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."" Today the British government and the European Union are making a fist of passing that test. Reading the joint report between the UK and the EU, it is clear that the most important section when considering the economics of Brexit is the section on Ireland. The document commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and that there will be ""no new regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It also commits to the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union. These two positions appear to be in contradiction. If Britain does become a ""third country"" - that is trading with the EU as other non-EU countries outside the single market and the customs union do - then border controls will be necessary. And that open border will become very much more closed. Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Business calls for more clarity Reality Check: What key lines really mean Brexit: All you need to know There is at least a partial way around this conundrum. And it necessitates the comprehensive free trade deal the British government has said it wants. And at least closely mirroring customs arrangements we presently adhere to as members of the EU's customs union. That equates for many with a ""soft Brexit"" and is the trajectory many economists argue would be best for the UK economy. This is because, if there is no free trade agreement, it is difficult to see how Theresa May's government could maintain ""full alignment with the rules of the internal market and the customs union which support north-south co-operation [on the island of Ireland]"" which the joint report commits the PM to. And still say that Britain has left the EU. This document has been described as the ""withdrawal deal"". But it is actually far more importantly a signal of what the future might hold. And that appears to be a relationship where the UK closely follows the EU's single market and customs union rules despite not being a formal member of either. Which might very well constrain Britain's ability to sign free trade deals with other countries outside the EU. The government will have to find a way through that if it is not to make Liam Fox's job as international trade secretary redundant. And in its deliberate ambiguity (every side needs to be able to claim victory) today's joint agreement leaves that debate for another day. The EU has said it wants to move urgently onto discussing and agreeing transition arrangements to be applied once Britain has officially left the union in March 2019. That now looks like being Phase II of this process. And from there, onto mapping out an agreement on free trade which will be put in place after the transition period has expired. That's Phase III. That has been seen as good news by businesses which need clarity on the trade rules they will be required to play by. And the more ""frictionless"" that trade is, many believe, the better for the economy. What today's deal has revealed is that there is a genuine desire - it appears from both sides - to get that free trade deal nailed down. ""One should be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise,"" Fitzgerald wrote. Today, the UK and the EU have moved the process of Brexit significantly forward. Even if the end point is still shrouded in much uncertainty.

"The prime minister made her decisions on Thursday night while the No 10 Downing Street Christmas party carried on. It isn't celebration on Friday though for her government, but relief. And her allies note that in those fraught hours she made thedecision to go to Brusselseven though the DUP had continued to make its objections known, despite the progress it had secured. That may be a comfort to her internal critics who believe that Theresa May is all too often a prisoner of circumstance rather than a bold decision maker. And after a rocky few months, Downing Street can breathe out, for once, because it reached a critical short-term goal, moving on from Monday's embarrassment to a temporary conclusion. And it matters so much. Brexit is the biggest political and policy project any British government has undertaken for many, many years. As the leader of the government pursuing the policy, the prime minister's own record rises and falls with the progress of our departure from the EU. Simply, while No 10 always maintains that she wants to focus on domestic reforms, Mrs May's fate is intertwined with these negotiations. The deal was sealed at an early hours breakfast meeting on Friday The talks stumble, and so does she. The negotiators muddle through, so does her leadership. And the deal at dawn mutes the criticism of her inside her party, and restores some of the faith perhaps in Brussels. Had it not been struck, had she not made the decision to get on the plane, there would have been serious rumblings in her party. It might not have been the end of her leadership. There are plenty of hopeful leadership contenders, but few who would be guaranteed to put their head above the parapet to try to push her out. But critical Brexiteers have been conspicuous by their absence. And Remainers are relieved that she has, as they see it, been firm in the face of some of their and the DUP's demands, and left the route pointing to asofter Brexit. In truth, so much has not been agreed. This is a document that to a large extent, resolves to solve problems and contradictions together in the future. The document contains more ambiguities than pages. And as with any compromises there are some losses, and some victories. Over time those fault lines will appear. The two sides of the Tories' internal debates over Europe have not suddenly met in the middle. The brooding clash has been delayed, again, allowing the prime minister to press on into the next phase. And above all, the agreements in this document may never come to pass. Truly, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"". This is a big, first, political step that allows the real journey to begin. With this progress, however limited, Theresa May buys breathing space.

"At 04:57 GMT Downing Street officially confirmed the wheels of Theresa May's plane were going up. The plans that had been put in place for a middle of the night dash to Brussels were going ahead. After many calls to DUP leader Arlene Foster in the early hours, all that was left for the prime minister was to share croissants with Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk and, finally, agree. Mrs May has achieved what she wanted - the green light to move on. Had she not, she would have been in deep, deep political trouble. But the 15 pages ofthe agreed joint EU-UK report,external, described as a ""personal success"" for Mrs May by Donald Tusk, give her what she needs for now. There are additional guarantees for Northern Ireland and the border, but an undefined statement on ""full alignment"", if there is no big trade deal. The implications of what ""full alignment"" means will be fought over by the two wings of the Conservative Party. One prominent Remainer this morning was frankly delighted that line was there, believing it is an opportunity to push for continued membership of the customs union for the whole UK. The DUP, for their part, agreed enough to move ahead. But they are clearly not happy about that particular issue, saying there is still a big debate to be had about what it really means. The UK has agreed a future role for the European Court of Justice, which Brexiteers may object to. But No 10 says it is temporary and narrow, and may only affect a handful of cases a year. And, as expected, there are no specific figures on the Brexit bill, although there are pretty chunky hypothetical commitments. Throughout the document, however, a lot is left open. This is a political agreement, not a practical one, that answers every single question. But for Downing Street today, the important thing is that it is done.  It is a big first step that goes some way to securing Mrs May's position.

"More than 200 pupils have been evacuated from a primary school in Fife after a large fire broke out. At least 30 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze at Cairneyhill Primary School near Dunfermline. Pupils and staff were all ""safe and well"" and were moved to a nearby church hall, Fife Council said. Local residents were asked to keep their windows closed and stay away from Northbank Road while emergency service workers dealt with the blaze. The fire, which broke out just after 13:00, was later contained by the fire crews, some parts of the school were badly damaged. This video can not be played A fire broke out in a Fife primary school on Friday lunchtime More than 200 pupils were evacuated from the school when the fire broke out Firefighters remained at the scene on Friday evening to check for any hidden fire spread. Group manager Richie Hall, the incident commander, said: ""It was a challenging environment but they did a tremendous job through difficult conditions to find that source, contain the fire - and then fight it. ""Their efforts meant that the fire, located in the centre of the building, was prevented from spreading any further. ""They are now searching for any further pockets of fire to ensure the building is made absolutely safe."" Mr Hall commended firefighters for their efforts in bringing the incident to a ""swift and safe"" conclusion. He added: ""I must also pay credit to both the children and the school staff who evacuated quickly and calmly, and made their way to a place of safety."" Allow Twitter content?

"Ari Behn was married to Princess Martha Louise from 2002-16 The King of Norway's former son-in-law has accused Kevin Spacey of groping him after a Nobel Peace Prize concert. Ari Behn told radio station P4,externalthat it happened after the actor had hosted the event in 2007. ""I am a generous person, but this was a bit more than I had in mind,"" said Behn, who was married to King Harald's daughter Martha Louise until last year. Spacey has been accused of sexual abuse and harassment by a string of men and has been written out of House of Cards. A spokesman for Spacey said last month that he was ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"" in the wake of the allegations.

""After five minutes he said, 'hey, let's go out and have a cigarette'. Then he puts his hand under the table and grabs me by the balls."" Behn said he put Spacey off by telling him: ""Er, maybe later."" He added: ""My hair was dark at the time, I was 10 years younger and right up his alley."" Last month, the Old Vic theatre in London said it had received 20 personal testimonies of alleged inappropriate behaviour by Spacey while he was artistic director there. He has faced other allegations too, with the claims leaving his career in ruins.

"This video can not be played Nicholas Hart says his daughter Averil's ""death was avoidable"" A teenager who ""starved to death"" in a matter of weeks was failed by ""every NHS organisation that should have cared for her"", a review has found. Averil Hart, 19, died in 2012 after her anorexia rapidly worsened at university in Norwich. Her father Nicholas said in just 10 weeks she went from being fit and healthy to ""being at death's door"". The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) found her death could and should have been prevented. The NHS services involved say changes have been made, with one saying it accepted the report's findings. Averil Hart went to the University of East Anglia to study creative writing Miss Hart, the youngest of three sisters, from Newton, near Sudbury, became unwell after her A-levels and spent 10 months as an in-patient at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She was discharged to study creative writing at the University of East Anglia. Miss Hart was found collapsed at the university in December 2012 and taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital by ambulance but saw no specialist eating disorders clinician for three days after admission, by which time her condition had deteriorated. She was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital on 11 December. Overnight her blood sugar fell to very low levels, but she did not receive appropriate treatment for this and became unconscious, suffering brain damage. She died three days later. Averil Hart's father says his daughter ""literally starved to death"" The ombudsman found Miss Hart did not receive ""appropriate care and treatment"". ""In addition, the local investigation into her death was wholly inadequate with the organisations involved being defensive and protective of themselves, rather than taking responsibility,"" the ombudsman's report said. Miss Hart's father Nicholas Hart, who lives in Newton, near Sudbury, said: ""As a parent I suppose it is a great relief to finally know that the words you knew were true all along and that Averil's death was avoidable. ""It is good to know that the report itself will enable other children and families to potentially not have to go through what we have been through. ""It was a needless death, it did not have to happen. It took only 10 weeks for her to go from fit and healthy to being at death's door."" Averil Hart celebrating her 11th birthday Ombudsman Rob Behrens said: ""Averil's tragic death would have been avoided if the NHS had cared for her appropriately. ""Sadly, these failures, and her family's subsequent fight to get answers, are not unique. ""The families who brought their complaints to us have helped uncover serious issues that require urgent national attention - I hope that our recommendations will mean that no other family will go through the same ordeal."" Dr Bill Kirkup, who led part of the investigation, said: ""I hope this report will act as a wake-up call to the NHS and health leaders to make urgent improvements to services for eating disorders so that we can avoid similar tragedies in the future."" Andrew Radford, chief executive at the eating disorder charity BEAT, said: ""The PHSO report is very clear, if the eating disorder had been recognised earlier and effective and timely care was put in place, Averil Hart's death would have been prevented. ""We await a response from the Government and NHS England who must learn and take action following this tragedy, we cannot continue to fail people with eating disorders. ""We must see good, joined-up intensive home and community-based treatment for people of all ages, and in all locations across the UK. This does require the NHS to reorganise but it will deliver improved outcomes for patients and considerable cost savings to the NHS. ""It is also clear there were multiple failings across the health service in the lead-up to this tragedy, and the behaviour of each responsible part of the NHS in evading and obfuscating justice is appalling, and piled even more distress on an already distraught family. This requires further investigation and action taken to ensure it cannot be repeated. ""This tragedy demonstrates, once again, the devastation eating disorders can cause."" A spokeswoman for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital said: ""We met Averil's family in 2014 to offer our sincere condolences for their sad and devastating loss. ""Since then we have taken into account the learning from this tragic event and our structure and processes have been reviewed."" As well has holding a black belt in karate, Averil Hart had travelled extensively A spokesman for Cambridge University Hospital said: ""The trust would like to repeat the apologies previously made to Averil Hart's family and accepts the findings and recommendations in the ombudsman's report. ""When Averil was transferred to Addenbrooke's in December 2012, she was already very unwell but her death, at that time, may have been avoided had failures in her care not taken place. ""A thorough investigation has been carried out, lessons have been learned from what happened to Averil and a number of changes made."" The Norfolk Community Eating Disorder unit, which was tasked with providing community care to Miss Hart, has been approached for comment but is yet to respond. The University of East Anglia declined to comment on the report, claiming it had ""been informed that legal action is pending subject to the outcome of an inquest"".

"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says ""sufficient progress"" has been made in Brexit talks Theresa May says the stage-one deal would ensure ""no hard border"" in Ireland The UK's estimated divorce bill will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn Cabinet ministers praise the PM's ""remarkable"" achievement But UKIP's Nigel Farage says it is ""humiliating"" for her Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says there has been no real breakthrough EU negotiator Michel Barnier calls it is a ""turning point"" but warns of hard work ahead Gavin Stamp The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Arlene Foster warns ""more work to do"" on NI while the Irish PM says the Republic has achieved its aims. It's been more than 12 hours since Theresa May boarded a flight to Brussels to put her seal on an agreement that she hopes will give the Brexit process a huge push forward to its next stage. Let's recap on the main developments.  Theresa May is expected to brief MPs on the agreement in the Commons on Monday. In the meantime, follow the BBC for reaction to this breakthrough moment over the weekend.     BBC Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler says the skillful drafting of the Brexit document has left all sides claiming victory. But have some of the key questions about the Irish border merely been ""kicked down the road""? This video can not be played Brexit deal wording is open to interpretation, says BBC Ireland correspondent Britain will be able to carry out criminal record checks, should it wish, on EU nationals seeking to stay in the country after Brexit. The government has said it wants applicants for settled status to have to declare any criminal convictions and for the authorities to be able to check UK databases and, in certain cases, verify international records. The UK's position was initially met with resistance in Brussels but ministers believe that they have got their way over the issue in Friday's agreement. The document, released earlier, says: ""Systematic criminality and security checks can - in the specific context of acquiring status under the Withdrawal Agreement - be carried out on all applicants for status under the agreement and applicants can be asked to declare criminality.""  There's been a bit of a kerfuffle about that picture of Boris Johnson visiting Downing Street yesterday, which was tweeted by chief whip Julian Smith. He said it was taken ""last night"" but some eagle-eyed observers spotted the clock on the No 10 mantelpiece, which indicated that it was actually the middle of the afternoon. It has now been confirmed that the shot was taken at 16.30 GMT. Does all this really matter? In the scheme of things probably not. But given Tory fault-lines over Brexit and the feverish atmosphere in the party, the extent of the foreign secretary's involvement in the negotiations and at what stage he was briefed is fascinating to the kremlinologists.

BBC Radio 5 live Former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern has told the BBC that Theresa May has been negotiating in good faith and that the government in Dublin has clearly received new guarantees from Downing Street when it comes to the border. They recognise that she's given very firm guarantees and I think this certainly allows the negotiations to go on. But, you know, we could be still here this time next year arguing about some of the detail."" Bertie Ahern, Former Irish prime minister BBC News Channel It's fair to say Conservative MP Anna Soubry has not been one of Theresa May's greatest cheerleaders in the past, having called for her to go after June's general election result. But she is positively gushing in her praise of the PM today, saying she has shown strong leadership and ""put her mark"" on the first-phase agreement. She has stood up and she has not been found to be wanting at all."" Anna Soubry Remember... the European Parliament has to give its backing to the final deal. Its Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, seems to have set some conditions before the parliament will give its blessing to the proposals for citizens' rights. Allow Twitter content?

The 3 million, which lobbies on behalf of citizens from other EU countries living in the UK, says Friday's agreement is a ""flawed compromise"". While welcoming some concessions, its chair Nicolas Hatton says too many guarantees are time-limited and many people who have made the UK their home are still ""in the dark"" about whether they will qualify for settled status. ""Our rights should not have an expiry date,"" he says. ""More worryingly, there is still no clarity around the registration criteria for these rights."" Allow Twitter content?

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva During his trip to Geneva for a UN debate on human rights, Jeremy Corbyn was asked several times whether Labour thought staying in the single market and the customs union was the best or most realistic option for Britain. He said he had made it ""very clear that we are leaving the EU"" and that Labour's policy was tariff-free trade. ""Lots of jobs depend on itâ¦it is essential that we maintain and defend those jobs"". However he would not specify how Labour thought tariff-free access could be achieved. He dismissed Nicola Sturgeon's call for Labour to join forces with the SNP to campaign for a Brexit which involved remaining inside the single market and the customs union, saying that staying in was ""not a necessary scenario"", adding ""we will be making our own case, she can make hers"". Sinn Fein has given a ""cautious and qualified"" welcome to the agreement on the Irish border although party president Gerry Adams said it was a ""work in progress"" and many questions remained to be answered. The devil remained in the detail, he said, and the Irish government must ""remain vigilant"" as talks progressed to the next stage. While the communique recognises the unique and special circumstances surrounding the issue of the Irish peace process and the border, it does not address key areas of concern for many citizens - especially nationalists living in the north and citizens in the border region. The insistence by the British that Britain and the north must leave the customs union and the single market presents a real and live danger which cannot be understated.""  This is a few hours old but we think it is worth sharing even now. The UK's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, earlier described Friday's first-phase agreement as a ""vital milestone"" in the Brexit process. Allow Twitter content?

Kamal AhmedEconomics editor Reading the joint report between the UK and the EU, it is clear that the most important section when considering the economics of Brexit is the section on Ireland. The document commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and that there will be ""no new regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It also commits to the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union. These two positions appear to be in contradiction. If Britain does become a ""third country"" - that is trading with the EU as other non-EU countries outside the single market and the customs union do - then border controls will be necessary. And that open border will become very much more closed. There is at least a partial way around this conundrum.Read more from Kamal Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking about Friday's Brexit agreement during a visit to the United Nations in Geneva. Asked if he thought it represented a significant breakthrough, he said ""no"" and suggested he wanted more clarity on how long the UK will stay in the customs union as well as protection for workers, consumer and environmental rights. Many of Friday's details, including the residency guarantee for EU citizens, could have been settled almost nearly 18 months ago, he suggests. ""This could have been done some time ago...The referendum took place in 2016. This is the first sign of movement since then."" Labour, he says, wants long-term tariff-free access to EU markets for British businesses. ""It is essential we protect and defends these jobs,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Britain and the EU have agreed a breakthrough in Brexit talks - but what's it all about? Most Brexit-suppporting Tories seem to be happy about what's been agreed although some are picking the odd hole in the documents. Former Welsh Secretary David Jones is worried about the implications if there is no agreement on how cross-border trade in Ireland is regulated. In such a scenario, he tells Radio 4's World at One the UK will be fully aligned to existing EU single market rules relating to North-South co-operation - a situation he thinks would hamper efforts to strike trade deals with other countries after the UK leaves. The worry about that is of course that it could relate to very important areas such as, for example, agriculture which we would want to throw into the mix in negotiating a free trade agreement with a third country. And if this was to persist it could severely handicap our ability to enter into those free trade agreements so I think we do need to see that particular provision refined.""  Are you one of the three million or so citizens of other EU countries currently living in the UK worried about their future? Here's an explainer of what's been agreed and what it means for you. In summary, EU and UK citizens will have free movement of rights until the day the UK withdraws from the EU - 29 March 2019. This, in effect, is the cut-off date for EU citizens moving to the UK. 
Anyone who arrives before Brexit day will have the right to stay. Those who are yet to be granted permanent residency in the UK will have their rights protected, so they  can still acquire it after withdrawal. The latest deal also includes reunification rights for relatives who do not live in the UK, to join them in the future.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Tomioka Hachimangu shrine is famous for a summer festival in August An attack believed to have been sparked by a succession feud has left three people dead at a well-known Shinto shrine in Tokyo. The chief priestess was stabbed to death, reportedly by her brother. A bloodied Samurai sword was found at the scene, along with other knives. The attacker's wife also took part in the ambush on Thursday evening, police say, injuring the priestess's driver. The male attacker then stabbed his wife to death before killing himself. The attack began when the 58-year-old priestess, Nagako Tomioka, got out of her car at the shrine and was confronted by her brother, Shigenaga Tomioka, 56, and his wife, said to be in her 30s. The wife reportedly attacked the priestess's driver, stabbing him with a sword. The driver fled the scene, pursued by the woman. Police said there was a trail of blood down the road but the driver's wounds were not life-threatening. The priestess suffered a deep stab wound to her chest, along with a laceration on the back of her neck, and was later pronounced dead. The suspects then moved to another part of the shrine's grounds. ""We believe the male suspect stabbed the woman before stabbing himself,"" a police spokesman said. Shinto priests attend a ritual during an autumn festival at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo Shintoism is Japan's indigenous religion. The essence of Shinto is its spirits, or kami, to which its followers are devoted. The kami are said to intervene in human lives if treated well by followers. The shrine is an essential part of Shinto. Along with rituals, the shrines are used to communicate with the kami. Devotees have a close relationship with their local shrine and often have a small shrine-altar at home. Shinto is regarded as less of a religion, more as a way of life. The name Shinto comes from Chinese characters for Shen (divine being), and Tao (way) and means Way of the Spirits. There are some 80,000 shrines, and about as many Shinto priests, in Japan but female priests make up only a tiny fraction of the number. About 80% of Japan's population practise some form of Shinto. According to local media, the murders were sparked by a longstanding succession feud between the priestess and her brother. Mr Tomioka had himself been chief priest of the shrine, having taken over from his father in the 1990s, according to the Asahi Shimbun. However, he was sacked in 2001 and their father returned to the position as main priest, installing his daughter Nagako Tomioka as the second-ranked in the shrine. It was not clear why he was removed. During those years, the suspect is said to have sent threatening letters to his sister and was arrested in 2006 after sending her a note saying he would ""send her to hell"". After their father retired in 2010, Ms Tomioka became the chief priestess, breaking with a Shinto shrine umbrella organisation after it failed to rubberstamp the succession, according to the Asahi Shimbun. The Tomioka Hachimangu shrine dates back to 1627 and is famous for the Fukagawa Hachiman summer festival in August. According to its website, it was among those to start the tradition in Edo (now Tokyo) of holding sumo tournaments on its grounds to attract visitors and donations - a custom still common at many Shinto shrines. Japan's emperor and empress visited the shrine in 2012.

"The Pope is suggesting changes to Christianity's best-known prayer Pope Francis has called for a translation of a phrase about temptation in the Lord's Prayer to be changed. The current wording that says ""lead us not into temptation"" is not a good translation because God does not lead humans to sin, he says. His suggestion is to use ""do not let us fall into temptation"" instead, he told Italian TV on Wednesday night. The Lord's Prayer is the best-known prayer in Christianity. The pontiff said France's Roman Catholic Church was now using the new wording ""do not let us fall into temptation"" as an alternative, and something similar should be used worldwide. ""Do not let me fall into temptation because it is I who fall, it is not God who throws me into temptation and then sees how I fell,"" he told TV2000, an Italian Catholic TV channel. ""A father does not do that, a father helps you to get up immediately."" It is a translation from the Latin Vulgate, a 4th-Century Latin translation of the Bible, which itself was translated from ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic. Since the beginning of his papacy, Pope Francis has not shied away from controversy and has tackled some issues head-on, Vatican observers say. He has previously saidthe Roman Catholic Church should apologise to gay people for the way it has treated them. He has also compared European migrant detention centres with concentration camps.

"Mohammed Abdallah was convicted following a trial at the Old Bailey A British man who travelled to Syria to join so-called Islamic State has been jailed for 10 years. Mohammed Abdallah was helped by his brother Abdalraouf, who set up a ""hub"" of communication for would-be fighters from his home in Manchester. Abdallah, of Westerling Way, Moss Side, Manchester, was convicted after a trial at the Old Bailey. He was found guilty of membership of IS, possessing an AK47 gun and receiving Â£2,000 for terrorism. The judge said Abdallah had ""bragged"" about acquiring weapons in messages and was ""totally committed"" to signing up to IS. Having seen first-hand people being maimed and killed in Libya, he was undeterred from travelling abroad again to ""kill or be killed"" in Syria, she said. ""There is no evidence of possession of extremist propaganda material. The evidence of your mindset is to be found in your actions. ""Your commitment to violence abroad is clear and you have not shown any sign of changing your views or attitudes,"" she said. The judge added: ""I do accept to some extent you acted under the influence of your brother."" Leaked IS document helps convict Manchester 'sniper' The court heard Abdallah had an IQ of 68 and had a previous conviction in 2013 for assaulting a police officer while drunk or high. Abdallah's IS registration document was translated into English and analysed by detectives The trial heard the 26-year-oldintended to meet three fellow jihadisin Syria. He was outed as an IS fighter last year when his IS registration document listing him as a ""specialist sniper"" was leaked to Sky News by a defector. In mitigation, Rajiv Menon QC said there was no evidence Abdallah was ""on a mission"" in the two years between leaving Syria after four weeks and the time his involvement with IS emerged. Mrs Justice McGowan jailed Abdallah for 10 years with five years on extended licence. The trial was told the Abdallah brothers, who had dual Libyan nationality, joined the ""Tripoli Brigade"" in 2011 and during a bloody battle against the Gaddafi regime, Abdalraouf was shot and paralysed from the waist down. Abdalraouf Abdallah has been in a wheelchair since he was injured in Libya at the age of 18 In the summer of 2014, Abdallah headed to Syria via Libya with fellow Libyan Nezar Khalifa, 27, planning to join IS with former RAF serviceman Stephen Gray, 34, and Raymond Matimba, 28, who were also from Manchester. Gray was turned away in Turkey, but Matimba eventually caught up with the others and appeared in footage with IS killer Jihadi John. In 2016, Sky News received files from an IS defector which listed Abdallah as a specialist sniper with expertise with the ""Dushka"", a Russian heavy machine gun, and fighting experience in Libya. It cited Manchester recruiter Raphael Hostey, also known as Abu Al-qaqa Al Britani, as a reference in Raqqa as well as a ""family friend"", the Libyan narrator of an IS video called Demolishing Borders. During the trial Abdallah denied swearing allegiance, saying he only went to Syria to help deliver $5,000 to the poor and someone else must have filled out the form without his knowledge. He said: ""It's true I refused to swear allegiance. They did send me to prison. ""I was threatened with being beheaded. ""I was shot at. I was hit. I had bruises and a black eye."" Abdallah's trial was delayed in the wake of the attack on the Manchester Arena over reported links with bomber SalmanAbedi, who attended the same mosque as the defendant and Hostey. He too had Libyan parents, lived in Manchester, and had travelled to Libya before returning to the city to plan the May 22 attack on an Ariana Grande concert that killed 22 people. In 2016, Abdalraouf Abdallah was found guilty of assisting others in committing acts of terrorism, and terror funding and jailed for five-and-a-half years. Gray, of Whitnall Street in Manchester, admitted three terrorism offences, including his attempts to travel to Syria, and wasjailed for five years. Hostey left the UK in 2013 and is believed to have been killed in a drone strike in 2016.

"Primark had to repay Â£231,973.12 mainly due to charging staff for uniforms Primark and Sports Direct have had to pay thousands of pounds back to staff for paying them below the minimum wage. The retailers had to repay the most of 260 firms named on the government's list for paying their staff below the legal minimum. Primark had to repay Â£231,973.12 mainly due to charging staff for uniforms. Sports Direct, and two staff agencies it used, had to pay back a total of Â£1.1m to their workers. All firms said the issues were now rectified. '150,000' UK workers to get pay rise Sports Direct pay-row agency fine upheld Football clubs 'shamed' over low wages A spokesperson for Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, said its uniform policy changed last year and that it ""had reviewed its procedures in order to avoid this situation re-occurring."" They said the average amount paid to the almost 10,000 staff affected was Â£23.75. Sports Direct, led by Mike Ashley, said the underpayment was due to ""a historical situation"" Sports Direct - together with the two agencies, Transline and Best Connection which it used to supply its staff - underpaid more than 4,000 staff in total. The retailer said the underpayment related to a ""historical situation in our warehouse that was widely publicised in 2016"". An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) last yearfound that some workers at the retailer's main distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire had been docked a quarter of an hour's pay if they clocked on one minute late. They also had to queue for an average of 11 minutes for security checks after their shifts had finished. This meant that some workers' pay fell below the minimum wage, or the National Living Wage for those aged over 25. A number of football clubs were also named on the government's list including Bristol Rovers; Wolves and Torquay in England andMotherwell; Greenock Morton and Falkirk in Scotland. Motherwell said the underpayment was due to ""an administrative error"" by the club. Overall, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said 16,000 workers had not received at least the minimum wage in its latest list, which it publishes twice a year. It said this was the highest number of employees affected since it first published the list in 2013. Collectively the workers are due Â£1.7m in back pay. The firms named on the list have also been fined a total of Â£1.3m by the government. The most common reasons for firms underpaying staff were failing to pay workers when they were travelling between jobs, not paying overtime and deducting money from staff pay for uniforms. 1. The Best Connection Group Limited, Bromsgrove B61, failed to pay Â£469,273.83 to 2,558 workers. 2. Qualitycourse Limited trading as Transline Group, Calderdale HD6, failed to pay Â£310,302.12 to 1,421 workers. 3. Primark Stores Limited, Reading RG1, failed to pay Â£231,973.12 to 9,735 workers. 4. Sports Direct.com Retail Limited, Bolsover NG20, failed to pay Â£167,036.24 to 383 workers. 5. Edward Mackay Contractor Ltd, Highland KW9, failed to pay Â£51,403.65 to four workers. Business minister Margot James said ""there is no excuse for not paying staff the wages they're entitled to"". Despite the government's apparent success in cracking down on pay, it is thought that hundreds of thousands of workers are still not getting their legal entitlement. In October last year the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalthe number of people whose pay was below the headline rate of the National Minimum Wage was 362,000. However that number includes workers whose pay levels are perfectly legal. For example, those who have accommodation or other benefits supplied as part of the job. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said minimum wage dodging had ""reached chronic levels in shops, salons and hospitality"" and urged the government to focus on these sectors.

"Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker announce progress in Brexit talks in Brussels on Friday More clarity on the Brexit transition is needed to stop companies proceeding with contingency plans despite the progress announced on Friday, the CBI has warned. Paul Drechsler, president of the business lobby group, said companies had begun triggering plans months ago. However, more detail could help suspend further action by firms, he said. Sterling was trading higherat just under $1.35 and â¬1.15 after the announcement in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""breakthrough"" meant Brexit talks could now move on to the next phase. The CBI's Mr Drechsler also called for ""unconditionality"" about the status of EU citizens living in the UK. ""It's an important political milestone, but clarity on transition is the most important thing from a business point of view at this stage,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Kamal Ahmed: Did 'soft Brexit' just win? 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks Live: Latest updates from Brussels Full text of the EU-UK statement,external The Institute of Directors (IoD) echoed the CBI's call for certainty on the rights of EU citizens. Stephen Martin, IoD director-general, said companies urgently needed certainty about the future of EU staff in the UK. ""We have grounds to hope now that our members will be able to send their employees off for the Christmas break feeling more comfortable about their status here,"" he said. ""We look forward to further clarity about what the UK's objectives are for that new relationship, as well as a firm commitment on transition in the very near future."" The reaction from big business organisations has been - broadly - ""phew, about time"". But it's not job done on Brexit - far from it. What companies say they need is certainty about future trading and customs arrangements with the EU, Britain's biggest trading partner. We are nowhere near such clarity. The immediate priority for businesses is a temporary transitional deal that kicks in as the UK leaves the EU. Only that will stop companies continuing to implement any Brexit contingency plans to relocate staff or offices, leaders warn. Some businesses say a long-term trade deal is not needed as global rules will suit the UK just fine. The government disagrees. However, ministers have not yet spelled out in detail what they hope the future trading relationship will look like. It will have to do that soon. Trade talks typically take years to complete. Those talks look set to be tougher than those on the divorce which - remember - have taken longer than both sides hoped. It took seven years for the EU and Canada to negotiate a deal, the EU's most ambitious yet. The UK hopes for an even more comprehensive arrangement than that. But there isn't seven years to spare. There are just 476 days until Brexit Day. Adam Marshall, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said ""clarity and security"" for European employees had been the biggest priority for UK companies since the referendum vote. ""We are delighted that they, as well as UK citizens living and working in the EU, now have more clarity and can plan their future with greater confidence,"" he said. As attention turns to trade negotiations, the BCC said companies wanted ""absolute clarity"" on the long-term deal being sought. ""Businesses want answers on what leaving the EU will mean for regulation, customs, hiring, standards, tariffs and taxes."" The EEF, which represents manufacturers, said the agreement was one step forward in a complex and long process. EEF chief executive Stephen Phipson said: ""We need to pin down the transition arrangements, which will be in place after March 2019, to ensure it's business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. ""Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality."" The ADS Group, the trade organisation that represents the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, called Friday's announcement ""an important step"". ""Continued uncertainty over arrangements for a transition period benefits no-one and it is vital that both parties make formal commitments as soon as possible to a transition lasting at least two years, allowing businesses to continue to invest in our economy with confidence,"" said ADS chief executive Paul Everitt.

"The wording of the UK's Brexit deal with the EUhas finally been agreed- but negotiations were nearly scuppered this week over the tinder-box issue of the Irish border. When Theresa May appointed ministers to her specially formed Brexit Cabinet Committee it was an early sign that she had failed to realise the significance and importance of the Irish border. The Northern Ireland Secretary was conspicuously missing from the line-up.,external I interviewed James Brokenshire shortly afterwards and he was left having to awkwardly defend his exclusion in favour of, among others, the International Development Secretary and the Conservative Party Chairman. How to get out of Brexit linguistic hole? What is 'regulatory alignment?' Long read: The hardest border Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland The truth is, during those early stages, the Prime Minister was perhaps more concerned with keeping her own party together rather than addressing the practical problems of Brexit. The cabinet committee was a carefully balanced selection of leavers and remainers. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire was not appointed to the Brexit Cabinet committee Besides, she seemed to reason, if you included the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how could you exclude his equivalents representing Scotland and Wales? However, it did not go unnoticed in Dublin. From the start there has been frustration there at what they see as internal party politicking at the expense of dealing with one of the really big issues of Brexit - the border. In the Irish government's view, since the Brexit vote, Brussels has seemed more concerned than Westminster about the implications for Northern Ireland. From London the consistent message has been: ""Let's sort this all out when we get to trade talks"". The Irish government has made it clear they do not want to see a hard border in place after Brexit There is some sense in the UK's position. The sticking point has never been about the free movement of people but instead the transport of goods. The final trading deal could ultimately decide whether there is a need for customs posts on the island of Ireland. However the Irish government is not prepared to wait until 2019. There are currently no check points along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland It wants a guarantee now of no physical presence or infrastructure where Northern Ireland meets the Republic of Ireland. And given that they could veto negotiations moving on to that vital issue of trade the UK has had to listen. It was with that in mind a form of words was worked out in Downing Street to satisfy the Irish. What seems bizarre is that they did not keep the DUP fully informed. Amid all the hoopla and what was to be the early celebration of an apparent deal on Monday,unionists were left less-than-quietly fuming. The DUP entered into a confidence and supply deal with the Conservatives after the general election in June For weeks, they had been issuing pretty explicit warnings that Northern Ireland should not be treated any differently to England, Scotland or Wales. The bluntest came from Sammy Wilson, the always straight-talking DUP MP for East Antrim. He said anything else could ruin their relationship with the Conservative government, who rely on the Democratic Unionists' support at Westminster. Sammy Wilson said Northern Ireland must not be treated differently or be left 'half in' the EU ""If there is any hint that in order to placate Dublin and the EU, they're prepared to have Northern Ireland treated differently than the rest of the UK, then they can't rely on our vote,"" Mr Wilson announced last Thursday. Remember that was just days before the UK put forward the controversial text that derailed the whole deal. Not showing the DUP those words before Theresa May travelled to Brussels seems truly remarkable, particularly as they seemed to promise that Northern Ireland would indeed be treated differently. They won't accept Dublin having any say in day-to-day affairs north of the Border and have even accused the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of pushing a united-Ireland agenda in these tortured negotiations. When security check points were in place it could add an extra hour to a round trip between Belfast and Dublin The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds recently set out the constitutional difficulties for the party in having Northern Ireland tied to the EU's regulations. ""Northern Ireland would have to have somebody else other than the United Kingdom speak for it and vote for it in the European Councils,"" he told me at the DUP's party conference. ""Who would that be? It would be Dublin. It would be completely unacceptable."" There have been many conspiracy theories touted, particularly in Belfast where the DUP's position is most clearly understood. Some commentators have written pieces saying it is just not feasible that Downing Street could have got it so wrong and there must be a negotiating ploy in play here. The reality appears to be a lot more simple. Donald Tusk said the UK's offer on Brexit must be acceptable to the Republic of Ireland before negotiations can move on Faced with time running out andDonald Tusk reinforcing that the Irish government had the right to veto talks from moving on to phase two, negotiators came up with the best phrasing they could find. But there is a simple problem with that - what the DUP, London and Dublin want are mutually exclusive. The Irish government is demandingno trading differences between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The DUP insists there can beno trading differences between Northern Ireland and Britain. And theBritish negotiating team don't want the whole UK to be tied to the EU's trading rules. Nigel Dodds is the deputy leader of the DUP Early on some seemed to think that the question of the Irish border could be easily answered because no one wanted a 'hard border'. The practical challenges meant that was never the case and a failure to grasp that at an early stage has left Theresa May in the middle of two Brexit negotiations - one with the EU and the other with the DUP.

"The UK and European Commission have reached an agreement that should allow them to move Brexit talks on to the next stage. Here are some of the key lines inthe agreement document.,external So here's the first linguistic somersault. This agreement is designed to lock in the progress made so far, and allow technical experts to continue to work on it during the second phase of talks. But EU negotiations always work on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and that raises the prospect that if the second phase runs into trouble, then what has been agreed so far could, in theory, unravel. That is certainly not the intention on either side, but it underscores that the negotiating process still has a very long way to run - and the hardest part is still to come. The separation agreement on citizens' rights will not fall under the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (officially called the CJEU but commonly referred to as the ECJ) which was the initial demand from the European Union. But the ECJ will continue to play a role, because this agreement says UK courts will have to pay ""due regard"" to its decisions on an indefinite basis. And for eight years after Brexit, there will be a mechanism for UK courts to refer questions of interpretation directly to the ECJ. It is a compromise, but the sort of compromise that some supporters of Brexit will find hard to stomach. This detail on citizens' rights is important. The agreement will apply to anyone taking up residence before the UK leaves the EU, so people could still take the decision to move next year, or even in early 2019, and they would be fully protected by it. That option will remain open for new arrivals until the day the UK leaves - currently presumed to be 29 March 2019. In fact the European Commission argues that the ""specified date"" should be considerably later. In anofficial communication to the European Council,externalit argues that during a transition all EU citizens should have all their rights upheld. In other words, it says, the ""specified date"" should not be the actual date of withdrawal, but the final day of a transition period (potentially two years later or even longer). There are also a lot of technical details hidden in the weeds of the agreement that remain to be negotiated, and that's why some groups representing citizens who are caught up in this dilemma are far from happy. The reaction of the European Parliament, which has taken a tough line on citizens' rights, will be important because it has to ratify the final agreement. This is the key phrase in the long section setting out how the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will operate after the UK leaves the EU. The preference on both sides is for an ambitious free trade agreement, which will address many of the concerns that have been raised (although questions of customs duties would still have to be addressed). As a backstop though, the UK has guaranteed that it will maintain ""full alignment"" with the EU's single market and customs rules that govern cross-border trade. It is a form of words that everyone can (just about) live with for now, but there is plenty of tough negotiating ahead. It's not entirely clear how full alignment could be maintained without Northern Ireland staying in the single market and the customs union, especially as there is no such thing as partial membership. It is another sign that the competing demands that have been discussed this week have been sidestepped, but not fully resolved. This sentence about the financial settlement is a bureaucratic masterpiece, and suggests that plenty of detail still needs to be sorted out behind the scenes. For months, the money appeared to be the most intractable issue in the withdrawal negotiations, but money is easier to finesse than borders or courts. A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill. UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way. Update 11 December 2017: This piece was amended to take account of the European Commission's view on the specified date for EU citizens' rights.

"This video can not be played Wildfires devastate southern California Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes in California as firefighters battle several raging wildfires. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. One death has been reported - a woman's body was found in a burned-out area in Ventura County. But an official told the Ventura Country Star newspaper that the death, in the town of Ojai, may have been the result of a car crash not related to the fire. California wildfire flames seen from space On Friday, US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in California, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"". About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the brushfires, officials have said, with firefighters drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County remains the largest, burning 180 square miles so far The Thomas fire in Ventura County to the north of Los Angeles remains the largest of the blazes and has spread as far as the Pacific coast. It has consumed 180 square miles (466 sq km) since it broke out on Monday, and destroyed more than 430 buildings, fire officials said. A BBC correspondent in Ojai says the blaze is burning in the hills all around and more than 100 fire engines have been seen driving through the town centre. Allow Twitter content?

"Wormwood Scrubs is one of the UK's most iconic prisons Chronic staff shortages, food running out and a surge in violence were among the findings of a critical prison report into Wormwood Scrubs. Inspectors also found areas of the west London jail were strewn with litter, attracting rats and cockroaches. Chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said the findings painted an ""extremely concerning picture"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the jail was recruiting staff in a bid to ""urgently"" raise standards. Wormwood Scrubs 'dangerous for officers' The HM Inspectorate of Prisons' report said Wormwood Scrubs, which holds more than 1,200 men, had high levels of often serious violence, resulting in some significant injuries. It also detailed how food routinely ran out in one wing, with staff having to source a half-used tray from another servery or distribute ""mountain survival"" dried food packs. There had been a ""dramatic"" increase in violence against staff, with more than 90 assaults in the six months to July, when inspectors visited the jail Far too many windows facing the perimeter wall were broken, which enabled prisoners to retrieve contraband thrown over the wall The prison stores had not been open for many weeks, leaving staff to ""scavenge"" for many basic items needed by inmates A case sample found important aspects of public protection work had not been done, potentially leaving some serious issues unmanaged Publishing the latest assessment, Mr Clarke said: ""Wormwood Scrubs is an iconic local prison serving communities in London. ""Overall, this was an extremely concerning picture, and we could see no justification as to why this poor situation had persisted since 2014. ""The governor and his team were, to their credit, working tirelessly to address the problems faced."" The MoJ said the prison had taken ""decisive action"" to reduce violence and was working to urgently improve conditions. A spokesman said: ""We know staffing remains an issue, so we are recruiting 120 extra officers and will cut the time taken for new recruits to begin training. ""The addition of new, senior probation staff has also led to significant improvements in resettling offenders into the community following release. ""We are pleased inspectors recognised the hard work and dedication of staff at the prison, especially in improving education and purposeful activity.""

A Europe-wide appeal to help Charlie Douthwaite - who was born with heart defect - was launched last month and he underwent a transplant last week. But his father Steven Douthwaite has posted on Facebook that Charlie has had a ""rough few days"" and may be rejecting the new heart. Charlie, who hashypoplastic left heart syndrome,external, was the youngest patient on the UK transplant waiting list. After his nine-hour operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, Charlie's mother, Tracie Wright, said the donor family had given him ""a second chance at life"".

The post said: ""Charlie has had a rough few days - we were told this could be the first stage of his body rejecting the heart, we also found out that they believe Charlie has caught sepsis so they have started him on antibiotics. ""Terrible feeling being told that his body might of been rejecting the heart, not nice living every second of your life on edge."" Charlie had to have open heart surgery when he was three days old, after being born weighing 6lb 5oz at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.

"NiceHash was targeted by hackers in the early hours of Wednesday ""Highly professional"" hackers made off with around 4,700 Bitcoin from a leading mining service, a Bitcoin exchange has said. The value of Bitcoin is currently extremely volatile, but at the time of writing, the amount stolen was worth approximately $80m. The hacked service was NiceHash, a Slovenia-based mining exchange. It said it was working hard to recover the Bitcoin for its users, adding: ""Someone really wanted to bring us down."" The attack happened early on Wednesday, said NiceHash's chief executive Marko Kobal. Attackers accessed the company's systems at 01:18 CET (00:18 GMT). By 03:37 the hackers, whom the company believes were based outside the European Union, had begun stealing Bitcoin. The theft comes as the price of Bitcoin continues to surge, dumbfounding experts and stoking concerns of a bubble. High-stakes attacks like this are not uncommon, with several large breaches and thefts hitting Bitcoin and other related services over the past year. NiceHash is a mining service, a company that pairs up people with spare computing power with those willing to pay to use it to mine for new Bitcoin. Mr Kobal appeared on Facebook Live to address concerns about the hack. ""We have not abandoned you guys,"" he said. He explained that an employee's computer was compromised in the attack. He added that ""forensic analysis"" involving local and international authorities was taking place, but did not expand on which specific agencies were involved when asked by the BBC. The company was heavily criticised by its users who commented in droves on Facebook. Communications were complicated further when a spoof Facebook page for the company was set up and spreading disinformation about the breach. Security issues involving Bitcoin and other related services are a frequent cause for concern for virtual currency traders. Other recent controversies involving digital currencies include: the firm behind digital currency Tether said that close to$31m (Â£23.4m) worth of its tokens were stolen a ""code bug"" inEthereum's digital walletsbeing blamed last month for freezing more than $150m worth of Ether, preventing investors from being able to cash out a South Korean exchange, Bithumb, saying that one of its employee's PCshad been hacked in June.

"This video can not be played Tensions are high in wake of Donald Trump's Jerusalem announcement Violence has flared between Israeli forces and Palestinians protesting at Donald Trump's contentious recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Clashes erupted in the occupied West Bank and over the Israeli-Gaza border, where one Palestinian was killed. Tensions are high in the wake ofMr Trump's announcement. His policy shift was hailed by Israel but condemned across the Arab and Islamic world. The UN's Middle East envoy warned of a risk the conflict would escalate. ""There is a serious risk today that we may see a chain of unilateral actions, which can only push us further away from achieving our shared goal of peace,"" Nickolay Mladenov told an emergency UN Security Council meeting, by videocall from Jerusalem. He called on all parties to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" and ""reign in radical elements"". While the meeting was going on, the Israeli army said it had intercepted a rocket launch from Gaza, but there had been ""no casualties and no damage"". Anger in the West Bank and delight in West Jerusalem Western allies of the US have disavowed Mr Trump's move, which reversed decades of US neutrality on the status of Jerusalem. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US became the first country to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital since the foundation of the state in 1948. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said it could take two years before the US embassy is relocated from Tel Aviv. In the West Bank, Israeli forces clashed with Palestinians in the cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah, Hebron and Nablus, as well as smaller locations. Television pictures from Bethlehem showed water cannon or so-called skunk water being used against stone-throwing protesters. This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace Clouds of tear gas and thick, black smoke from burning tyres filled the air. There were also reports of rubber bullets being fired by troops. Similar scenes were reported in other places where there were confrontations. Extra police were deployed in East Jerusalem ahead of the planned protests Israel had deployed extra battalions to the West Bank in anticipation of violence after Palestinian leaders called for protests after Friday prayers. In East Jerusalem there were scuffles as police pushed back hundreds of demonstrators outside the Old City. The ancient walled area, containing contentious holy sites, is historically a flashpoint for violence. At least 217 Palestinians were wounded in the confrontations in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestinian medics said. A 30-year-old Palestinian was killed and dozens of others injured in Gaza after Israeli forces opened fire after protesters threw stones at army posts on the border. Trump's speech in full Media reacts to 'slap of the century' Five key takeaways from speech Elsewhere, demonstrations against Mr Trump's announcement have spread. This video can not be played We hear from BBC reporters at protests in Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters held noisy demonstrations in Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Tunisia and Iran. Further afield, protesters rallied in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indian-administered Kashmir and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. There has been widespread denunciation of Mr Trump's move, especially in the Muslim world. Protests have swept the Arab world and further afield America's closest Arab allies, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, have expressed their opposition, while Egypt, Bolivia, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden, the UK and Uruguay have called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday to discuss the step. Which countries condemned Trump's move? Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Mr Trump's announcement was ""deplorable"" and a senior Palestinian official said US Vice President Mike Pence was ""not welcome in Palestine"" during a planned visit to the region later this month. Israel's arch-foe Iran accused Donald Trump of trying to provoke a war, while the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon called on the Muslim and Arab world to support a new intifada. Israel itself has hailed the announcement as historic.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a ""courageous and just decision"",external, whilesome 250 Israeli rabbis, including the chief rabbi of the Sephardi Jewish community, signed a letter thanking Mr Trump,external. Jerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Israel occupied the eastern sector - previously occupied by Jordan - in 1967, and annexed it in 1980, but the move has never been recognised internationally. Some 330,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem, along with about 200,000 Israeli Jews in a dozen settlements there. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel does not regard them as settlements but legitimate neighbourhoods. What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Why settlement issue is so difficult According to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. The last round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and while the US is formulating fresh proposals, Palestinian officials have said Mr Trump's announcement has disqualified the US from brokering future negotiations.

"Boris Johnson will urge Iran to free British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from jail when he visits Tehran. The foreign secretary is expected to travel to Iran in the next few days. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison since April 2016 after being accused of spying. She denies the claim. Supporters of the 38-year-old from London say that she recently had a health assessment to see if she was fit enough to remain in prison. Mr Johnson's Tehran trip will see him raising the cases of other dual nationals being held in Iran. He will also discuss British concerns over Iranian involvement in conflicts in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Yemen. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Medical concern for Briton held in Iran In November Mr Johnson apologised in the Commons after telling a committee of MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran. He retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Critics complained that the foreign secretary's initial comments could lead to her five-year jail term being increased. Mr Johnson met her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, in November to discuss calls for her to beprovided with diplomatic protection. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested Mr Ratcliffe told BBC News his wife was due back in court on Sunday to face possible new charges and it was important Mr Johnson would be in Iran around the same time to ""make clear that he thinks Nazanin is innocent and should be home with her family"". He said: ""I don't know if I'm expecting him to be able to unlock it all, and she comes out with him, but it can only be a good thing that he is there"". Mr Ratcliffe said he had wanted to accompany Mr Johnson but the Foreign Office felt his presence would be ""too political"". By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When Boris Johnson arrives in Tehran this weekend, the foreign secretary will be required to perform some nifty diplomatic footwork even before he comes to address the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. For relations between Britain and the Islamic Republic of Iran are delicate at the best of times. It is only six years since a mob stormed and sacked Britain's embassy in Tehran. And to some in Iran, Britain will always be seen as the ""Little Satan"", a former imperial power that meddles in their country's affairs at America's bidding. Both the UK and Iran have now restored diplomatic relations. But good relations are a work in progress. So this visit, Mr Johnson's first, is designed above all to stabilise what has at times been a difficult relationship, a trip that was planned long before the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe became a frontline political issue. Read more of James Landale's analysis here. The mother had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested last year. The child has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran for the last 20 months. Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his daughter during his wife's incarceration. There were concerns about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health after lumps in her breasts were discovered butthose were found to be non-cancerous. Richard Ratcliffe and Boris Johnson met at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in November In November Mr Ratcliffe said: ""She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I absolutely believe that's true. ""I think it's important I don't exaggerate anything in the media and I'm not melodramatic, but she is in a difficult place.""

"Universities could be accused of ""mis-selling"" courses to teenagers who have little understanding of money matters, the public spending watchdog says. National Audit Office head Amyas Morse said young people were taking out large loans to pay for tuition fees without much effective help or advice. It compared the higher education market to financial products, highlighting how little regulation universities faced. The government said its reforms were helping students make informed choices. But the NAO report highlights that tighter rules apply to the sale of complex financial products than to universities offering courses that may well be more expensive. Mr Morse said: ""If this was a regulated financial market, we would be raising the question of mis-selling."" The report says a student loan is likely to be a person's biggest sum for borrowing after a mortgage and will require a long-term commitment. The average loan is expected to top Â£50,000 by the time it is repaid. But the decision whether or not to go to university and which course and provider to choose is typically made at the age of 16 or 17. These choices can have a long-lasting impact on future employment and earnings prospects, the report says. And where services or markets are especially complex, consumers often need additional support and protection to make good choices. The report says the Financial Conduct Authority requires companies to disclose clearly the risks of such products to potential customers. But for universities there are limited comparable disclosure requirements, despite the clear strong financial incentives to attract as many students as possible. Mr Morse said: ""We are deliberately thinking of higher education as a market, and as a market, it has a number of points of failure. ""Young people are taking out substantial loans to pay for courses, without much effective help and advice, and the institutions concerned are under very little competitive pressure to provide best value."" The report also suggests only a third of higher education students say their course offers value for money. Mr Morse added: ""The [education] department is taking action to address some of these issues, but there is a lot that remains to be done."" The report also highlights how despite increased participation by students from disadvantaged groups, they are far more likely to attend courses at ""lower ranked providers"". The report does, however, note that students have statutory protections - including the fact repayments are based on earnings and liability is written off after a set amount of time - and that graduates earn on average 42% more than non-graduates. The government said its student finance system removed the financial barriers for those going to university. It is also planning a review of tertiary education to ensure a joined up system works for everyone. Meg Hillier MP, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said the government was failing to give inexperienced young people the advice and protection they needed when making one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. ""It has created a generation of students hit by massive debts, many of whom doubt their degree is worth the money paid for it,"" she said. But Universities UK said universities had increased investment in teaching and learning, and that students were now reporting record levels of satisfaction with their courses. ""Graduates leaving our universities are also increasingly in demand from employers and continue to benefit from their degrees. They earn on average almost Â£10,000 a year more than people without degrees and are more likely to be employed."" It added that they would be working with the new Office for Students to ensure that students have the necessary information to make informed decisions and to ensure that competition works in the interests of all students.

"Bitcoin's value has been volatile in recent weeks Bitcoin continued its rollercoaster ride on Friday, hitting a new high above $17,000 (Â£12,615) before falling. The digital currency slid as low as $13,963, according toCoindesk.com,external, before rallying again to trade at about $15,600 on Friday afternoon. Bitcoin has soared about 70% this week, with its dramatic rise being likened to a ""charging train with no brakes"". As concerns mount, an industry group has warned plans to start Bitcoin futures trading have been ""rushed"". Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, but others argue it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. ""Bitcoin now seems like a charging train with no brakes,"" said Shane Chanel, from Sydney-based ASR Wealth Advisers. Nigel Green, of financial consultancy deVere Group, said he expected Bitcoin to see-saw in coming weeks. ""Today's digital world needs crypto-currencies. One or two of the existing ones will succeed. Whether it's Bitcoin or not remains to be seen,"" he added. Millions 'stolen' in NiceHash Bitcoin heist What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? Bitcoin: Risky bubble or the future? US regulator approves Bitcoin trading The surging price of Bitcoin has been helped by the start of trading on the Chicago-based Cboe Futures Exchange on Sunday. The world's largest futures exchange, CME, will begin its Bitcoin offering a week later. Trading on futures exchangesallows investors to buy and sell contracts for the crypto-currency at a certain point in the future at an agreed price. Tim McCourt, CME's global head of equity index and alternative investment products, said customers are excited but he is not certain how much interest the futures will attract in the first days of trading. He said he will consider the launch successful if there is a balance of buyers and sellers, and market movements correspond to the underlying Bitcoin price. ""That's the larger measure of success,"" he said. ""What does the market look like - not necessarily how much does it trade."" 'Weighing the risks'? The Futures Industry Association, which includes Wall Street's largest banks, brokers and traders, has written to the US regulator over concerns that the contracts were approved ""without properly weighing the risks"". ""A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearing houses,"" the association said. Edward Tilly, chief executive of Cboe, said he thinks the criticism is unfair. He said his firm worked extensively with regulators to figure out how this would work. For example, the firm set up rules in the contracts to address concerns that Bitcoin's value has sometimes varied widely, depending on the exchange. ""This is a walk-before-you-run launch,"" he said. ""It is mindful that this is new to the marketplace."" While Goldman Sachs is a member of the futures industry association, it is also one of the banks that will work as an intermediary to help clear Bitcoin futures contracts for some clients. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said it was evaluating the risks as part of its due diligence process. Many big investors have been reluctant to pile into the crypto-currency market unless it is regulated. However, the prospect of a Bitcoin futures market has raised hopes that it will be regarded as sufficiently ""regulated"". While Bitcoin has become more mainstream in recent weeks, many observers warn the market could be a bubble waiting to pop. Mr Green added: ""Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset that remains in uncharted waters... an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors."" Even a crash or a major correction is unlikely to pose risks to the global economy, some analysts say. While billions of dollars have been invested in Bitcoin, its $268bn total market value is still small compared to other asset classes.

"Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker announce progress in Brexit talks in Brussels on Friday More clarity on the Brexit transition is needed to stop companies proceeding with contingency plans despite the progress announced on Friday, the CBI has warned. Paul Drechsler, president of the business lobby group, said companies had begun triggering plans months ago. However, more detail could help suspend further action by firms, he said. Sterling was trading higherat just under $1.35 and â¬1.15 after the announcement in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""breakthrough"" meant Brexit talks could now move on to the next phase. The CBI's Mr Drechsler also called for ""unconditionality"" about the status of EU citizens living in the UK. ""It's an important political milestone, but clarity on transition is the most important thing from a business point of view at this stage,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Kamal Ahmed: Did 'soft Brexit' just win? 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks Live: Latest updates from Brussels Full text of the EU-UK statement,external The Institute of Directors (IoD) echoed the CBI's call for certainty on the rights of EU citizens. Stephen Martin, IoD director-general, said companies urgently needed certainty about the future of EU staff in the UK. ""We have grounds to hope now that our members will be able to send their employees off for the Christmas break feeling more comfortable about their status here,"" he said. ""We look forward to further clarity about what the UK's objectives are for that new relationship, as well as a firm commitment on transition in the very near future."" The reaction from big business organisations has been - broadly - ""phew, about time"". But it's not job done on Brexit - far from it. What companies say they need is certainty about future trading and customs arrangements with the EU, Britain's biggest trading partner. We are nowhere near such clarity. The immediate priority for businesses is a temporary transitional deal that kicks in as the UK leaves the EU. Only that will stop companies continuing to implement any Brexit contingency plans to relocate staff or offices, leaders warn. Some businesses say a long-term trade deal is not needed as global rules will suit the UK just fine. The government disagrees. However, ministers have not yet spelled out in detail what they hope the future trading relationship will look like. It will have to do that soon. Trade talks typically take years to complete. Those talks look set to be tougher than those on the divorce which - remember - have taken longer than both sides hoped. It took seven years for the EU and Canada to negotiate a deal, the EU's most ambitious yet. The UK hopes for an even more comprehensive arrangement than that. But there isn't seven years to spare. There are just 476 days until Brexit Day. Adam Marshall, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said ""clarity and security"" for European employees had been the biggest priority for UK companies since the referendum vote. ""We are delighted that they, as well as UK citizens living and working in the EU, now have more clarity and can plan their future with greater confidence,"" he said. As attention turns to trade negotiations, the BCC said companies wanted ""absolute clarity"" on the long-term deal being sought. ""Businesses want answers on what leaving the EU will mean for regulation, customs, hiring, standards, tariffs and taxes."" The EEF, which represents manufacturers, said the agreement was one step forward in a complex and long process. EEF chief executive Stephen Phipson said: ""We need to pin down the transition arrangements, which will be in place after March 2019, to ensure it's business as usual for companies for as long as it takes until a final deal is reached. ""Until we get to that point, many businesses will need to prepare for any and every eventuality."" The ADS Group, the trade organisation that represents the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, called Friday's announcement ""an important step"". ""Continued uncertainty over arrangements for a transition period benefits no-one and it is vital that both parties make formal commitments as soon as possible to a transition lasting at least two years, allowing businesses to continue to invest in our economy with confidence,"" said ADS chief executive Paul Everitt.

"At 04:57 GMT Downing Street officially confirmed the wheels of Theresa May's plane were going up. The plans that had been put in place for a middle of the night dash to Brussels were going ahead. After many calls to DUP leader Arlene Foster in the early hours, all that was left for the prime minister was to share croissants with Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk and, finally, agree. Mrs May has achieved what she wanted - the green light to move on. Had she not, she would have been in deep, deep political trouble. But the 15 pages ofthe agreed joint EU-UK report,external, described as a ""personal success"" for Mrs May by Donald Tusk, give her what she needs for now. There are additional guarantees for Northern Ireland and the border, but an undefined statement on ""full alignment"", if there is no big trade deal. The implications of what ""full alignment"" means will be fought over by the two wings of the Conservative Party. One prominent Remainer this morning was frankly delighted that line was there, believing it is an opportunity to push for continued membership of the customs union for the whole UK. The DUP, for their part, agreed enough to move ahead. But they are clearly not happy about that particular issue, saying there is still a big debate to be had about what it really means. The UK has agreed a future role for the European Court of Justice, which Brexiteers may object to. But No 10 says it is temporary and narrow, and may only affect a handful of cases a year. And, as expected, there are no specific figures on the Brexit bill, although there are pretty chunky hypothetical commitments. Throughout the document, however, a lot is left open. This is a political agreement, not a practical one, that answers every single question. But for Downing Street today, the important thing is that it is done.

"Bitcoin's value has been volatile in recent weeks Bitcoin continued its rollercoaster ride on Friday, hitting a new high above $17,000 (Â£12,615) before falling. The digital currency slid as low as $13,963, according toCoindesk.com,external, before rallying again to trade at about $15,600 on Friday afternoon. Bitcoin has soared about 70% this week, with its dramatic rise being likened to a ""charging train with no brakes"". As concerns mount, an industry group has warned plans to start Bitcoin futures trading have been ""rushed"". Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, but others argue it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. ""Bitcoin now seems like a charging train with no brakes,"" said Shane Chanel, from Sydney-based ASR Wealth Advisers. Nigel Green, of financial consultancy deVere Group, said he expected Bitcoin to see-saw in coming weeks. ""Today's digital world needs crypto-currencies. One or two of the existing ones will succeed. Whether it's Bitcoin or not remains to be seen,"" he added. Millions 'stolen' in NiceHash Bitcoin heist What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? Bitcoin: Risky bubble or the future? US regulator approves Bitcoin trading The surging price of Bitcoin has been helped by the start of trading on the Chicago-based Cboe Futures Exchange on Sunday. The world's largest futures exchange, CME, will begin its Bitcoin offering a week later. Trading on futures exchangesallows investors to buy and sell contracts for the crypto-currency at a certain point in the future at an agreed price. Tim McCourt, CME's global head of equity index and alternative investment products, said customers are excited but he is not certain how much interest the futures will attract in the first days of trading. He said he will consider the launch successful if there is a balance of buyers and sellers, and market movements correspond to the underlying Bitcoin price. ""That's the larger measure of success,"" he said. ""What does the market look like - not necessarily how much does it trade."" 'Weighing the risks'? The Futures Industry Association, which includes Wall Street's largest banks, brokers and traders, has written to the US regulator over concerns that the contracts were approved ""without properly weighing the risks"". ""A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearing houses,"" the association said. Edward Tilly, chief executive of Cboe, said he thinks the criticism is unfair. He said his firm worked extensively with regulators to figure out how this would work. For example, the firm set up rules in the contracts to address concerns that Bitcoin's value has sometimes varied widely, depending on the exchange. ""This is a walk-before-you-run launch,"" he said. ""It is mindful that this is new to the marketplace."" While Goldman Sachs is a member of the futures industry association, it is also one of the banks that will work as an intermediary to help clear Bitcoin futures contracts for some clients. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said it was evaluating the risks as part of its due diligence process. Many big investors have been reluctant to pile into the crypto-currency market unless it is regulated. However, the prospect of a Bitcoin futures market has raised hopes that it will be regarded as sufficiently ""regulated"". While Bitcoin has become more mainstream in recent weeks, many observers warn the market could be a bubble waiting to pop. Mr Green added: ""Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset that remains in uncharted waters... an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors."" Even a crash or a major correction is unlikely to pose risks to the global economy, some analysts say. While billions of dollars have been invested in Bitcoin, its $268bn total market value is still small compared to other asset classes.

"European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says ""sufficient progress"" has been made in Brexit talks Theresa May says the stage-one deal would ensure ""no hard border"" in Ireland The UK's estimated divorce bill will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn Cabinet ministers praise the PM's ""remarkable"" achievement But UKIP's Nigel Farage says it is ""humiliating"" for her Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says there has been no real breakthrough EU negotiator Michel Barnier calls it is a ""turning point"" but warns of hard work ahead Gavin Stamp The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Arlene Foster warns ""more work to do"" on NI while the Irish PM says the Republic has achieved its aims. It's been more than 12 hours since Theresa May boarded a flight to Brussels to put her seal on an agreement that she hopes will give the Brexit process a huge push forward to its next stage. Let's recap on the main developments.  Theresa May is expected to brief MPs on the agreement in the Commons on Monday. In the meantime, follow the BBC for reaction to this breakthrough moment over the weekend.     BBC Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler says the skillful drafting of the Brexit document has left all sides claiming victory. But have some of the key questions about the Irish border merely been ""kicked down the road""? This video can not be played Brexit deal wording is open to interpretation, says BBC Ireland correspondent Britain will be able to carry out criminal record checks, should it wish, on EU nationals seeking to stay in the country after Brexit. The government has said it wants applicants for settled status to have to declare any criminal convictions and for the authorities to be able to check UK databases and, in certain cases, verify international records. The UK's position was initially met with resistance in Brussels but ministers believe that they have got their way over the issue in Friday's agreement. The document, released earlier, says: ""Systematic criminality and security checks can - in the specific context of acquiring status under the Withdrawal Agreement - be carried out on all applicants for status under the agreement and applicants can be asked to declare criminality.""  There's been a bit of a kerfuffle about that picture of Boris Johnson visiting Downing Street yesterday, which was tweeted by chief whip Julian Smith. He said it was taken ""last night"" but some eagle-eyed observers spotted the clock on the No 10 mantelpiece, which indicated that it was actually the middle of the afternoon. It has now been confirmed that the shot was taken at 16.30 GMT. Does all this really matter? In the scheme of things probably not. But given Tory fault-lines over Brexit and the feverish atmosphere in the party, the extent of the foreign secretary's involvement in the negotiations and at what stage he was briefed is fascinating to the kremlinologists.

BBC Radio 5 live Former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern has told the BBC that Theresa May has been negotiating in good faith and that the government in Dublin has clearly received new guarantees from Downing Street when it comes to the border. They recognise that she's given very firm guarantees and I think this certainly allows the negotiations to go on. But, you know, we could be still here this time next year arguing about some of the detail."" Bertie Ahern, Former Irish prime minister BBC News Channel It's fair to say Conservative MP Anna Soubry has not been one of Theresa May's greatest cheerleaders in the past, having called for her to go after June's general election result. But she is positively gushing in her praise of the PM today, saying she has shown strong leadership and ""put her mark"" on the first-phase agreement. She has stood up and she has not been found to be wanting at all."" Anna Soubry Remember... the European Parliament has to give its backing to the final deal. Its Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, seems to have set some conditions before the parliament will give its blessing to the proposals for citizens' rights. Allow Twitter content?

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva During his trip to Geneva for a UN debate on human rights, Jeremy Corbyn was asked several times whether Labour thought staying in the single market and the customs union was the best or most realistic option for Britain. He said he had made it ""very clear that we are leaving the EU"" and that Labour's policy was tariff-free trade. ""Lots of jobs depend on itâ¦it is essential that we maintain and defend those jobs"". However he would not specify how Labour thought tariff-free access could be achieved. He dismissed Nicola Sturgeon's call for Labour to join forces with the SNP to campaign for a Brexit which involved remaining inside the single market and the customs union, saying that staying in was ""not a necessary scenario"", adding ""we will be making our own case, she can make hers"". Sinn Fein has given a ""cautious and qualified"" welcome to the agreement on the Irish border although party president Gerry Adams said it was a ""work in progress"" and many questions remained to be answered. The devil remained in the detail, he said, and the Irish government must ""remain vigilant"" as talks progressed to the next stage. While the communique recognises the unique and special circumstances surrounding the issue of the Irish peace process and the border, it does not address key areas of concern for many citizens - especially nationalists living in the north and citizens in the border region. The insistence by the British that Britain and the north must leave the customs union and the single market presents a real and live danger which cannot be understated.""  This is a few hours old but we think it is worth sharing even now. The UK's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, earlier described Friday's first-phase agreement as a ""vital milestone"" in the Brexit process. Allow Twitter content?

Kamal AhmedEconomics editor Reading the joint report between the UK and the EU, it is clear that the most important section when considering the economics of Brexit is the section on Ireland. The document commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and that there will be ""no new regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It also commits to the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union. These two positions appear to be in contradiction. If Britain does become a ""third country"" - that is trading with the EU as other non-EU countries outside the single market and the customs union do - then border controls will be necessary. And that open border will become very much more closed. There is at least a partial way around this conundrum.Read more from Kamal Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking about Friday's Brexit agreement during a visit to the United Nations in Geneva. Asked if he thought it represented a significant breakthrough, he said ""no"" and suggested he wanted more clarity on how long the UK will stay in the customs union as well as protection for workers, consumer and environmental rights. Many of Friday's details, including the residency guarantee for EU citizens, could have been settled almost nearly 18 months ago, he suggests. ""This could have been done some time ago...The referendum took place in 2016. This is the first sign of movement since then."" Labour, he says, wants long-term tariff-free access to EU markets for British businesses. ""It is essential we protect and defends these jobs,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Britain and the EU have agreed a breakthrough in Brexit talks - but what's it all about? Most Brexit-suppporting Tories seem to be happy about what's been agreed although some are picking the odd hole in the documents. Former Welsh Secretary David Jones is worried about the implications if there is no agreement on how cross-border trade in Ireland is regulated. In such a scenario, he tells Radio 4's World at One the UK will be fully aligned to existing EU single market rules relating to North-South co-operation - a situation he thinks would hamper efforts to strike trade deals with other countries after the UK leaves. The worry about that is of course that it could relate to very important areas such as, for example, agriculture which we would want to throw into the mix in negotiating a free trade agreement with a third country. And if this was to persist it could severely handicap our ability to enter into those free trade agreements so I think we do need to see that particular provision refined.""  Are you one of the three million or so citizens of other EU countries currently living in the UK worried about their future? Here's an explainer of what's been agreed and what it means for you. In summary, EU and UK citizens will have free movement of rights until the day the UK withdraws from the EU - 29 March 2019. This, in effect, is the cut-off date for EU citizens moving to the UK. 
Anyone who arrives before Brexit day will have the right to stay. Those who are yet to be granted permanent residency in the UK will have their rights protected, so they  can still acquire it after withdrawal. The latest deal also includes reunification rights for relatives who do not live in the UK, to join them in the future.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Tomioka Hachimangu shrine is famous for a summer festival in August An attack believed to have been sparked by a succession feud has left three people dead at a well-known Shinto shrine in Tokyo. The chief priestess was stabbed to death, reportedly by her brother. A bloodied Samurai sword was found at the scene, along with other knives. The attacker's wife also took part in the ambush on Thursday evening, police say, injuring the priestess's driver. The male attacker then stabbed his wife to death before killing himself. The attack began when the 58-year-old priestess, Nagako Tomioka, got out of her car at the shrine and was confronted by her brother, Shigenaga Tomioka, 56, and his wife, said to be in her 30s. The wife reportedly attacked the priestess's driver, stabbing him with a sword. The driver fled the scene, pursued by the woman. Police said there was a trail of blood down the road but the driver's wounds were not life-threatening. The priestess suffered a deep stab wound to her chest, along with a laceration on the back of her neck, and was later pronounced dead. The suspects then moved to another part of the shrine's grounds. ""We believe the male suspect stabbed the woman before stabbing himself,"" a police spokesman said. Shinto priests attend a ritual during an autumn festival at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo Shintoism is Japan's indigenous religion. The essence of Shinto is its spirits, or kami, to which its followers are devoted. The kami are said to intervene in human lives if treated well by followers. The shrine is an essential part of Shinto. Along with rituals, the shrines are used to communicate with the kami. Devotees have a close relationship with their local shrine and often have a small shrine-altar at home. Shinto is regarded as less of a religion, more as a way of life. The name Shinto comes from Chinese characters for Shen (divine being), and Tao (way) and means Way of the Spirits. There are some 80,000 shrines, and about as many Shinto priests, in Japan but female priests make up only a tiny fraction of the number. About 80% of Japan's population practise some form of Shinto. According to local media, the murders were sparked by a longstanding succession feud between the priestess and her brother. Mr Tomioka had himself been chief priest of the shrine, having taken over from his father in the 1990s, according to the Asahi Shimbun. However, he was sacked in 2001 and their father returned to the position as main priest, installing his daughter Nagako Tomioka as the second-ranked in the shrine. It was not clear why he was removed. During those years, the suspect is said to have sent threatening letters to his sister and was arrested in 2006 after sending her a note saying he would ""send her to hell"". After their father retired in 2010, Ms Tomioka became the chief priestess, breaking with a Shinto shrine umbrella organisation after it failed to rubberstamp the succession, according to the Asahi Shimbun. The Tomioka Hachimangu shrine dates back to 1627 and is famous for the Fukagawa Hachiman summer festival in August. According to its website, it was among those to start the tradition in Edo (now Tokyo) of holding sumo tournaments on its grounds to attract visitors and donations - a custom still common at many Shinto shrines. Japan's emperor and empress visited the shrine in 2012.

"Wormwood Scrubs is one of the UK's most iconic prisons Chronic staff shortages, food running out and a surge in violence were among the findings of a critical prison report into Wormwood Scrubs. Inspectors also found areas of the west London jail were strewn with litter, attracting rats and cockroaches. Chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said the findings painted an ""extremely concerning picture"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the jail was recruiting staff in a bid to ""urgently"" raise standards. Wormwood Scrubs 'dangerous for officers' The HM Inspectorate of Prisons' report said Wormwood Scrubs, which holds more than 1,200 men, had high levels of often serious violence, resulting in some significant injuries. It also detailed how food routinely ran out in one wing, with staff having to source a half-used tray from another servery or distribute ""mountain survival"" dried food packs. There had been a ""dramatic"" increase in violence against staff, with more than 90 assaults in the six months to July, when inspectors visited the jail Far too many windows facing the perimeter wall were broken, which enabled prisoners to retrieve contraband thrown over the wall The prison stores had not been open for many weeks, leaving staff to ""scavenge"" for many basic items needed by inmates A case sample found important aspects of public protection work had not been done, potentially leaving some serious issues unmanaged Publishing the latest assessment, Mr Clarke said: ""Wormwood Scrubs is an iconic local prison serving communities in London. ""Overall, this was an extremely concerning picture, and we could see no justification as to why this poor situation had persisted since 2014. ""The governor and his team were, to their credit, working tirelessly to address the problems faced."" The MoJ said the prison had taken ""decisive action"" to reduce violence and was working to urgently improve conditions. A spokesman said: ""We know staffing remains an issue, so we are recruiting 120 extra officers and will cut the time taken for new recruits to begin training. ""The addition of new, senior probation staff has also led to significant improvements in resettling offenders into the community following release. ""We are pleased inspectors recognised the hard work and dedication of staff at the prison, especially in improving education and purposeful activity.""

"This video can not be played The prime minister said the deal will allow more to be invested in ""priorities at home"" PM Theresa May has struck a last-minute deal with the EU in a bid to move Brexit talks on to the next phase. There will be no ""hard border"" with Ireland; and the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be protected. The so-called ""divorce bill"" will amount to between Â£35bn and Â£39bn, Downing Street sources say. The European Commission president said it was a ""breakthrough"" and he was confident EU leaders will approve it. Brexit deal as it happened Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Kuenssberg: Theresa May buys breathing space So, did 'soft Brexit' just win? Brexitcast - EU deal special Reality Check: What next for talks? They are due to meet next Thursday for a European Council summit and need to give their backing to the deal if the next phase of negotiations are to begin. Talks can then move onto a transition deal to cover a period of up to two years after Brexit, and the ""framework for the future relationship"" - preliminary discussions about a future trade deal, although the EU says a deal can only be finalised once the UK has left the EU. A final withdrawal treaty and transition deal will have to be ratified by the EU nations and the UK Parliament, before the UK leaves in March 2019. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose opposition on Monday led to talks breaking down,  said there was still ""more work to be done"" on the border issue and how it votes on the final deal ""will depend on its contents"". Mrs May depends on the party's support to win key votes in Westminster. The pound was trading at a six-month high against the euro as news broke of the draft agreement. Guarantee that there will be""no hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republicand that the ""constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom"" will be maintained. EU citizens living in the UK and vice versawill have their rights to live, work and study protected.  The agreement includes reunification rights for relatives who do not live in the UK to join them in their host country in the future Financial settlement- No specific figure is in the document but Downing Street sources say it will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn, including budget contributions during a two-year ""transition"" period after March 2019 Brexit: All you need to know The UK government and the EU want to maintain the free flow of goods, without border checks that they fear could threaten a return to The Troubles, but the DUP does not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK after Brexit. The joint EU-UK document says any future deal must protect ""North-South co-operation"" and hold to the UK's ""guarantee of avoiding a hard border"". The agreement also says ""no new regulatory barriers"" will be allowed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and that Northern Ireland's businesses will continue to have ""unfettered access"" to the UK internal market - a passage thought to have been added to meet DUP concerns. But it also sets out a fallback position if the UK fails to agree a trade deal. This could prove controversial because it says there will continue to be ""full alignment"" between the EU and Northern Ireland on some elements of cross-border trade, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP would have preferred this not to be in the agreement, says the BBC's Chris Morris, and there could be some hard negotiating to do further down the line. 'More Brexit work to be done' warns Foster What does Brexit deal mean for NI? Watching the Brexit deal unfold in Brussels Agreement has been reached on what happens to the three million EU citizens living in the UK and more than a million UK citizens in EU states after Brexit. EU citizens currently in the UK would be allowed to continue living and working there - and those already in the country who do not yet have permanent residency would be able to acquire it after Brexit. Freedom of movement could continue for two years after March 2019, although the UK says new arrivals will have to register. The plan is that UK citizens in living in an EU country would get the same rights, although they would not retain them if they moved to another EU country. For eight years after Brexit, UK courts will be able to refer cases involving EU nationals to the European Court of Justice for interpretation. But the campaign group the 3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, said there was ""still no clarity around the registration criteria for these rights"" and said of the eight years: ""Our rights should not have an expiry date"". Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? A figure is not mentioned in the text of the agreement but Downing Street sources says it will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn.  It will be paid over four years and the precise figure is unlikely to be known for some time. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU had agreed to drop the cost of relocating UK-based EU agencies from the final divorce bill. The prime minister said it would be ""fair to the British taxpayer"" and would mean the UK in future ""will be able to invest more in our priorities at home, such as housing, schools and the NHS"". Technically a future trade deal cannot be signed while the UK remains a member of the EU but ""preliminary and preparatory discussions"" can begin. But the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the withdrawal treaty and transition deal need to be ready by October 2018 - in order that they can be ratified by March 2019, before the ""real negotiation"" begins on the future relationship. Mr Barnier suggested on Friday that the only option for a future trade arrangement wasa Canada-style deal, rather than a one based on Norway, which retains free movement and unrestricted access to the single market but pays into the EU budget. The European Council wants the UK to remain a ""member"" of the EU's customs union and single market and to remain under the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition period, according to a leaked document.

"This video can not be played Wildfires devastate southern California Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes in California as firefighters battle several raging wildfires. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. One death has been reported - a woman's body was found in a burned-out area in Ventura County. But an official told the Ventura Country Star newspaper that the death, in the town of Ojai, may have been the result of a car crash not related to the fire. California wildfire flames seen from space On Friday, US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in California, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"". About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the brushfires, officials have said, with firefighters drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County remains the largest, burning 180 square miles so far The Thomas fire in Ventura County to the north of Los Angeles remains the largest of the blazes and has spread as far as the Pacific coast. It has consumed 180 square miles (466 sq km) since it broke out on Monday, and destroyed more than 430 buildings, fire officials said. A BBC correspondent in Ojai says the blaze is burning in the hills all around and more than 100 fire engines have been seen driving through the town centre. Allow Twitter content?

"Border officials have seized Â£1.5m worth of counterfeit Calvin Klein pants, along with fake Dyson fans, Superdry hoodies and Nike shoes. The authorities are using the hauls to highlight the risk of buying cut-price, substandard counterfeits at Christmas. The Intellectual Property Office is also using humour to fight the fakes. It has createda Youtube series,externalin which a couple sing about their 12 days of rashes, injuries and humiliation due to dodgy Christmas gifts. The daily updates feature warnings about ""copy floppy"" boxer shorts, perfume that ""smelt like sick"" and ""risky whisky"" containing anti-freeze. Every year dire warnings are issued over the dangers posed by fake goods, from poisonings to electrical fires. The Intellectual Property Office hopes that by taking a more light-hearted tone they will reach consumers who have ignored their previous messages. The couple sing about ""copy floppy boxer shorts"" and perfume that ""smelt like sick"" In the run up to Christmas a surge in counterfeits enters the country, from designer watches to children's toys, as shoppers, keen to save money at a costly time of year, are either hoodwinked or turn a blind eye to the lack of authenticity. And border officials step up their efforts to block them, employing huge x-ray machines to check that the items inside shipping crates match the accompanying documents. This video can not be played Millions of pounds of fake goods seized ahead of Christmas ""Counterfeiters will counterfeit anything,"" said Sean Gigg, Border Force higher officer at Southampton Dock. ""It's based on supply and demand."" ""It can be anything from cosmetics to jewellery to watches to the latest toys but also undergarments as well."" Among the items seized in recent weeks are: â¢1,440 Superdry hoodie tops worth approximately Â£100,000 â¢16,000 Gillette Mach 3 razor blades worth approximately Â£143,840 â¢82,320 Calvin Klein underpants worth approximately Â£1.5m â¢450 Dyson fans and Apple chargers worth approximately Â£182,500 â¢1,530 Pandora charms worth approximately Â£45,900 â¢379 Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund football shirts worth approximately Â£16,149 â¢48 pairs of Nike Vapormax trainers worth approximately Â£5,760 â¢2,112 Spiderman, Pokemon and Hello Kitty hand held fans worth approximately Â£31,680 By highlighting the range of products seized, the authorities hope to alert consumers to the chance that if a price is too good to be true for a sought after item, the product probably isn't genuine. Border officials find counterfeiters respond to fashions for popular gifts While designer handbags are perennial favourites, other faked items vary from year to year following fashions, suggesting counterfeiters have an understanding of the market to match the top retail buyers. Back in 2013 officials seized mock-versions of Beats by Dr Dre headphones and Ugg boots. In 2015 fake - and dangerous - hoverboards were a big problem. Last year saw a lot of Harry Potter wands, Nike Air Max trainers and Pokemon, Nintendo and Minecraft cuddly toys being stopped. The IPO said it hoped to grab attention ""rather than be seen as shaking a stick"" by trying a more light-hearted approach in its video this year, in the hope that it will be shared on social media. However Ros Lynch, director of copyright and enforcement at the Intellectual Property Office, said the underlying issues were ultimately very serious. ""Those involved in counterfeiting are in the business to take advantage of consumers and make huge profits in the process. ""The goods are often of inferior quality, dangerous and the proceeds can be used to fund other serious organised crime. ""Counterfeiters have a total disregard for safety or quality, and even if items look genuine at first, they may end up being a dangerous or inferior copy.""

"Universities could be accused of ""mis-selling"" courses to teenagers who have little understanding of money matters, the public spending watchdog says. National Audit Office head Amyas Morse said young people were taking out large loans to pay for tuition fees without much effective help or advice. It compared the higher education market to financial products, highlighting how little regulation universities faced. The government said its reforms were helping students make informed choices. But the NAO report highlights that tighter rules apply to the sale of complex financial products than to universities offering courses that may well be more expensive. Mr Morse said: ""If this was a regulated financial market, we would be raising the question of mis-selling."" The report says a student loan is likely to be a person's biggest sum for borrowing after a mortgage and will require a long-term commitment. The average loan is expected to top Â£50,000 by the time it is repaid. But the decision whether or not to go to university and which course and provider to choose is typically made at the age of 16 or 17. These choices can have a long-lasting impact on future employment and earnings prospects, the report says. And where services or markets are especially complex, consumers often need additional support and protection to make good choices. The report says the Financial Conduct Authority requires companies to disclose clearly the risks of such products to potential customers. But for universities there are limited comparable disclosure requirements, despite the clear strong financial incentives to attract as many students as possible. Mr Morse said: ""We are deliberately thinking of higher education as a market, and as a market, it has a number of points of failure. ""Young people are taking out substantial loans to pay for courses, without much effective help and advice, and the institutions concerned are under very little competitive pressure to provide best value."" The report also suggests only a third of higher education students say their course offers value for money. Mr Morse added: ""The [education] department is taking action to address some of these issues, but there is a lot that remains to be done."" The report also highlights how despite increased participation by students from disadvantaged groups, they are far more likely to attend courses at ""lower ranked providers"". The report does, however, note that students have statutory protections - including the fact repayments are based on earnings and liability is written off after a set amount of time - and that graduates earn on average 42% more than non-graduates. The government said its student finance system removed the financial barriers for those going to university. It is also planning a review of tertiary education to ensure a joined up system works for everyone. Meg Hillier MP, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said the government was failing to give inexperienced young people the advice and protection they needed when making one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. ""It has created a generation of students hit by massive debts, many of whom doubt their degree is worth the money paid for it,"" she said. But Universities UK said universities had increased investment in teaching and learning, and that students were now reporting record levels of satisfaction with their courses. ""Graduates leaving our universities are also increasingly in demand from employers and continue to benefit from their degrees. They earn on average almost Â£10,000 a year more than people without degrees and are more likely to be employed."" It added that they would be working with the new Office for Students to ensure that students have the necessary information to make informed decisions and to ensure that competition works in the interests of all students.

"Asthma symptoms can be brought on by exercise in elite athletes Professional footballers should be screened for exercise-induced asthma, researchers say, after a study found three in 10 could be affected. University of Kent scientists used lung tests to identify players with symptoms and improved their fitness after treatment. Elite athletes are known to be prone to asthma-related problems because of their high-intensity breathing. Experts said screening made sense and could prevent later problems. In the study, presented at a meeting of the British Thoracic Society, 97 footballers in England from two Premier League clubs, one Championship club and a League One club had their lung health tested during pre-season. Twenty-seven players tested positive for airway or breathing problems, also known as exercise-induced asthma. Ten of those had no previous history of asthma or airway problems. When they were treated with appropriate medication, their symptoms - such as tightness of the chest, wheezing and coughing after playing - reduced, and their lung function improved over time. The researchers also found that their aerobic fitness and performance on the pitch improved. Airway problems can be treated using lung health screening, experts say Dr John Dickinson, from the school of sport and exercise science at the University of Kent, said although top football clubs were good at screening players for heart problems, they were not carrying out tests which could identify respiratory problems - which were much more common. ""Clubs can't rely on players reporting symptoms because they are not always that obvious and sometimes they are written off as poor fitness,"" he said. 'Wear a scarf' to stop asthma attacks 'My miracle daughter died from asthma' The researchers used medical tests to assess the footballers' breathing, airway function and how efficiently they could empty their lungs. They were then able to detect asthma-related symptoms accurately and tailor treatment for those affected. Improving the health of footballers' airways also has other benefits, Dr Dickinson said. ""They are less likely to pick up coughs and colds."" It is a common lung condition caused by inflammation or swelling of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs It can cause wheezing, breathlessness, a tight chest and coughing This can occur after exposure to a trigger, such as allergens (pollens, animal fur and house dust), cigarette smoke, gases, cold air, exercise and chest infections Asthma can affect people of all ages and the severity of the symptoms varies from person to person Exercise-induced asthma only happens during or after exercise Source:NHS - Asthma,external High rates of exercise-induced asthma have been found in other sports among elite athletes. Experts believe it may be connected to athletes exercising regularly at high intensity which means their breathing rates are also high When the air is cold and dry, and if there is exposure to air pollution or other allergens like pollen, this could worsen symptoms - but more research is needed to confirm this. Dr Lisa Davies, consultant respiratory physician and chairwoman of the British Thoracic Society's board of trustees, said lungs were pivotal to exercise and life in general. ""In key sports, where the lungs are worked hard and are prone to repeat exposure to different and challenging internal and external conditions - it really makes sense to have lung health screening, so if there are any airway problems they can be treated.""

The UK's position was initially met with resistance in Brussels but ministers believe that they have got their way over the issue in Friday's agreement. The document, released earlier, says: ""Systematic criminality and security checks can - in the specific context of acquiring status under the Withdrawal Agreement - be carried out on all applicants for status under the agreement and applicants can be asked to declare criminality.""  There's been a bit of a kerfuffle about that picture of Boris Johnson visiting Downing Street yesterday, which was tweeted by chief whip Julian Smith.

It has now been confirmed that the shot was taken at 16.30 GMT. Does all this really matter? In the scheme of things probably not.

"The future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains a sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.  BBC Reality Check explains. Yes, borders are not just about security checks, tariffs and customs duties. When two countries (in this case the UK and the Republic of Ireland) are both members of the European Union, and therefore in the single market and the customs union, then many rules and regulations on both sides of the border are identical. That doesn't mean all rules are the same (think of speed limits in miles per hour or kilometres per hour for example) but a huge number of basic standards are. That means you don't have to check standards at the border because you know they are the same to start with. Over the summer, Brexit negotiators identified more than 140 areas of ""north-south co-operation"" that would be affected by Brexit in one way or another. Many of them are issues associated with cross-border trade in the agricultural sector - things like food safety and animal welfare. Energy is another important issue (there is an all-Ireland electricity market) - so too is transport (safety standards on cross-border routes) and the medical sector (the same rules governing things like prescriptions and medical devices). All of them are regulated under the umbrella of common EU legislation. If Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK, starts changing its regulations after Brexit, then problems start to arise. But the language is pretty confusing. At one point, the Irish government was asking for ""no regulatory divergence"". Now the dispute seems to be about ""continued regulatory alignment"". If you start from the point we're at right now, with all these rules and regulations the same, then ""no divergence"" implies that Northern Ireland would not be able to change them at all. It would have to remain the same as the Republic of Ireland (and the wider EU). Alignment implies something slightly different - two similar systems running in parallel could be aligned, but be different in some respects. So it is language which produces a little more wiggle room. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he thinks both phrases mean the same thing. If other parties think they mean something slightly different and honour is satisfied - well, that's the kind of creative ambiguity that sometimes makes international negotiations work. Yes. Everyone says they want to avoid the return of a ""hard"" border (a border where there is some kind of physical infrastructure and some kind of checks). But they all have slightly different solutions. The Irish government want a guarantee that regulations will remain broadly the same; the DUP doesn't want Northern Ireland to be treated any differently from the rest of the UK; Scotland, Wales, London and probably several others want special treatment themselves; and the EU is left wondering whether the UK government can square the circle. Leo Varadkar says ""avoiding regulatory divergence"" and ""maintaining regulatory alignment"" mean the same thing Either you try to limit the alignment of regulations to a few specific issues including some of those which fall under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the document on which the Northern Ireland peace process is based. (The Irish government wants a written guarantee that any agreement on the border respects the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.) Or you declare that you will try to ensure that some form of regulatory alignment eventually refers to the whole of the UK, not just to Northern Ireland. But option one would mean that Northern Ireland was being treated slightly differently which might be unacceptable to the DUP (on whom Theresa May is dependent for her parliamentary majority). And option two would upset Brexit supporters (on whom Theresa May is also dependent for her parliamentary majority) who argue that one of the main aims of Brexit was to be able move away from the EU's regulatory framework. Many in the EU think the heart of the problem is that by insisting that there should be a) no hard border b) no UK membership of the single market and the customs union and c) no checks of any kind between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, the government in Westminster has set up a series of fundamentally incompatible red lines. For everyone politics has come home to roost. In various past negotiations - both in Northern Ireland and more generally in the EU - a form of words to satisfy all sides has been found at the eleventh hour. That could well happen again - but, don't forget, the aim at the moment is only to reach ""sufficient progress"" in the negotiations. If a deal is declared this week or next, that is by no means the end of the story. The UK government insists that if an ambitious trade agreement can be agreed with the EU in the future, then all of these detailed concerns about the Irish border will melt away. Mr Varadkar has also said an EU-UK trade agreement allowing free trade to continue is his preferred option. But until that happens the border will remain a fundamental part of the Brexit negotiations for some time to come.

"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary David Davis is quizzed by committee chairman Hilary Benn The government has not carried out any impact assessments of leaving the EU on the UK economy, Brexit Secretary David Davis has told MPs. Mr Davis said the usefulness of such assessments would be ""near zero"" because of the scale of change Brexit is likely to cause. He said the government had produced a ""sectoral analysis"" of different industries but not a ""forecast"" of what would happen when the UK leaves the EU. Labour called it a ""shambles"". The Liberal Democrats said impact assessments were urgently needed while the SNP called it an ""ongoing farce"". Mr Davis said a ""very major contingency planning operation"" was in place for Brexit. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict May says 'good progress' made on Brexit Pienaar: Davis raises questions over Brexit planning Kuenssberg: The phone call that never was Opposition MPs have been on the trail of the ""Brexit impact assessments"" for months. And when David Davis told them they didn't exist, they were quick to highlight some similar-sounding studies he had referred to in the past: October 2016,asked what assessment the government had made of the impact of Brexit on the economy: ""We currently have in place an assessment of 51 sectors of the economy. We are looking at those one by one, but the aim at the end is that this will inform the negotiating approach so that no one gets hurt."" December 2016, to the Brexit Committee: ""We are in the midst of carrying out about 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% of the economyâ¦ everything except sectors that are not affected by international trade."" February 2017, in a statement to MPs: ""We continue to analyse the impact of our exit across the breadth of the UK economy, covering more than 50 sectors - I think it was 58 at the last count - to shape our negotiating position."" June 2017,on the Andrew Marr Show:""That data's being gathered, we've got 50, nearly 60 sector analyses already done, we've got planning work going on in the customs, we've got planning work going on 22 other issues which are critical, 127 all told."" Downing Street told journalists: ""We have been clear that the impact assessments don't exist. They're a specific thing in Whitehall terms. We think we have complied with the terms of the motion."" At Wednesday morning's Brexit committee hearing, chairman Hilary Benn asked whether impact assessments had been carried out into various parts of the economy, listing the automotive, aerospace and financial sectors. ""I think the answer's going to be no to all of them,"" Mr Davis responded. When Mr Benn suggested this was ""strange"", the minister said formal assessments were not needed to know that ""regulatory hurdles"" would have an impact, describing Brexit as a ""paradigm change"" of similar impact to the financial crash, which could not be predicted. ""I am not a fan of economic models because they have all proven wrong,"" he said. 'Davis sounded frazzled' -by the BBC's Norman Smith David Davis has probably not done the Brexit cause a huge bundle of good this morning. First, his frank admission that no impact assessments have been completed will inevitably be seized on by critics to argue Team May simply haven't done the basic spadework. Second his suggestion that he doesn't have the resources for this, and anyway some of the work his officials have done wasn't much good, is hardly a ringing endorsement of his Brexit department. Third, Mr Davis probably didn't help his own reputation by telling the committee he had been handed two chapters of the 850 pages of analysis but hadn't read them. At times Mr Davis even chided the committee over the time they were taking. Fair enough the Brexit secretary had a cold - but at times he sounded thoroughly frazzled and cheesed off. Not a great look. There has been a long-running row over the government's Brexit studies and their publication. MPs have been pushing for the documents to be published, and on 1 November the Commons passed a motion to release ""Brexit impact assessments"" to the Brexit Committee of MPs. In response, the government said this motion ""misunderstood"" what the documents actually were, but has since provided an edited set of reports to the committee. David Davis said the impact of Brexit on different sectors had not been assessed Mr Davis told the MPs this represented ""getting as close as we can to meeting what we took to be the intent of Parliament"". A ""quantitative economic forecast of outcome"" does not exist, he said. ""That is not there. We have not done that. What is there is the size of the industry, the employment and so on."" Mr Davis also said there was no ""systematic impact assessment"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks: ""Do they exist, or donât they?"" During PMQs, Prime Minister Theresa May repeated Mr Davis' line that ""sectoral analysis"", not ""impact assessments"" had been drawn up, adding that the government would not give a running commentary on the negotiations. ""This really is a shambles,"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. Later, Chancellor Philip Hammond was asked whether the Treasury had produced analysis of the potential economic impact of Brexit. He said his department had ""modelled and analysed a whole range of potential alternative structures between the EU and the UK, potential alternative arrangements and agreements that might be made"". Appearing before the Treasury Select Committee, he suggested these could be made public when a Brexit deal has been agreed, but said to do so at this stage would be ""deeply unhelpful to the negotiation"".

"This video can not be played Franken attacked Donald Trump and Roy Moore in his resignation speech Democratic Senator and ex-comedian Al Franken has said he plans to quit ""in the coming weeks"" after string of sexual harassment allegations. ""I am proud that during my time in the Senate that I have used my power to be a champion of women,"" the Minnesota senator said from the US Senate floor. His speech came a day after nearly 30 Democrats called on him to resign. He would be the most prominent lawmaker to resign amid a wave of misconduct claims against high-profile figures. Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives Ethics Committee launched sexual harassment investigations into two Republican congressmen. Trent Franks of Arizona announced he was resigning as the inquiry was announced. Mr Franken arrived at the Capitol holding hands with his wife He acknowledged having made two female congressional aides ""uncomfortable"" by asking them about surrogacy when he and his wife faced infertility. The committee also said it would investigate Blake Farenthold, who used $84,000 (Â£62,000) oftaxpayers' money to settle a sexual harassment lawsuitwith his former spokeswoman. Over in the Senate, Mr Franken told his colleagues on Thursday: ""Today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate. ""I may be resigning my seat but I am not giving up my voice."" The former Saturday Night Live comic and two-term senator has apologised to several women who have accused him of groping and sexual harassment, but he faced mounting pressure to step aside after a new allegation surfaced on Wednesday. Democrats desert senator in grope claims Mr Franken said some of the claims against him ""are simply are not true"", but added that women ""deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously"". He also referenced the sexual misconduct allegations that have been levelled against President Donald Trump and Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. ""I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party."" This video can not be played Franken accuser: I was disgusted Mr Franken is not the only US politician to have found himself engulfed by sexual harassment in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Michigan Democrat John Conyers announced he would resign amid claims of sexual harassment made by his congressional aides. US lawmaker to retire amid harassment claims Seven women have come forward to accuse Mr Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court judge, of sexual misconduct decades ago. Several Democratic female senators - including some who called for Mr Franken's resignation a day earlier - hugged the lawmaker after his speech.

""Nothing is easy or pleasant about this,"" she wrote, ""but we all must recognise that our workplace cultures - and the way we treat each other as human beings - must change."" The decision to fill the vacancy left by Mr Franken will fall to Democratic Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who said in a statement he has not determined who will replace him.

"Asthma symptoms can be brought on by exercise in elite athletes Professional footballers should be screened for exercise-induced asthma, researchers say, after a study found three in 10 could be affected. University of Kent scientists used lung tests to identify players with symptoms and improved their fitness after treatment. Elite athletes are known to be prone to asthma-related problems because of their high-intensity breathing. Experts said screening made sense and could prevent later problems. In the study, presented at a meeting of the British Thoracic Society, 97 footballers in England from two Premier League clubs, one Championship club and a League One club had their lung health tested during pre-season. Twenty-seven players tested positive for airway or breathing problems, also known as exercise-induced asthma. Ten of those had no previous history of asthma or airway problems. When they were treated with appropriate medication, their symptoms - such as tightness of the chest, wheezing and coughing after playing - reduced, and their lung function improved over time. The researchers also found that their aerobic fitness and performance on the pitch improved. Airway problems can be treated using lung health screening, experts say Dr John Dickinson, from the school of sport and exercise science at the University of Kent, said although top football clubs were good at screening players for heart problems, they were not carrying out tests which could identify respiratory problems - which were much more common. ""Clubs can't rely on players reporting symptoms because they are not always that obvious and sometimes they are written off as poor fitness,"" he said. 'Wear a scarf' to stop asthma attacks 'My miracle daughter died from asthma' The researchers used medical tests to assess the footballers' breathing, airway function and how efficiently they could empty their lungs. They were then able to detect asthma-related symptoms accurately and tailor treatment for those affected. Improving the health of footballers' airways also has other benefits, Dr Dickinson said. ""They are less likely to pick up coughs and colds."" It is a common lung condition caused by inflammation or swelling of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs It can cause wheezing, breathlessness, a tight chest and coughing This can occur after exposure to a trigger, such as allergens (pollens, animal fur and house dust), cigarette smoke, gases, cold air, exercise and chest infections Asthma can affect people of all ages and the severity of the symptoms varies from person to person Exercise-induced asthma only happens during or after exercise Source:NHS - Asthma,external High rates of exercise-induced asthma have been found in other sports among elite athletes. Experts believe it may be connected to athletes exercising regularly at high intensity which means their breathing rates are also high When the air is cold and dry, and if there is exposure to air pollution or other allergens like pollen, this could worsen symptoms - but more research is needed to confirm this. Dr Lisa Davies, consultant respiratory physician and chairwoman of the British Thoracic Society's board of trustees, said lungs were pivotal to exercise and life in general. ""In key sports, where the lungs are worked hard and are prone to repeat exposure to different and challenging internal and external conditions - it really makes sense to have lung health screening, so if there are any airway problems they can be treated.""

What happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been among the key sticking points in Brexit negotiations. On Monday, the DUP - whose support the UK prime minister needs to win key votes in Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. They included aligning regulations in Northern Ireland with those in the Republic so as to avoid border checks. This video can not be played ""However many times you phrase it, we're not going to be making any comment"" The DUP insists it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland, on the other hand, which is an EU member, wants a guarantee that there will be no hard border between it and Northern Ireland after Brexit. The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. The EU will only agree to discuss this when it judges that enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues"" - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far.

"Theresa May has arrived in Brussels following overnight talks on the issue of the Irish border. The PM and Brexit Secretary David Davis are meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Details of an agreement are expected to be set out at a joint news conference within the hour. If the border question has been settled, talks can move on to the future of trade after Brexit. Additional wording is understood to have been added to reassure the DUP, whose opposition on Monday led to talks breaking down.

"Is it done? Not yet. But, but, but, after two days where it has felt that there has been very little movement indeed, tonight, the atmosphere has changed. Well-placed sources on the EU and UK sides sound suddenly cheerful. New language to add to the agreement thatfailed to persuade the DUPat the start of the week has been discussed approvingly in London, Brussels and Dublin. And on Thursday evening, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's spokesman posted this: But the DUP, who blocked the deal on Monday, humiliating Theresa May, are not yet fully on board. Until their support can be guaranteed, don't expect Theresa May to get on the plane. They are no strangers to taking their time, and making the most of their maximum moments of leverage. It is possible that Theresa May could, by Friday evening, have been to Brussels and back, and have an agreement approved that would allow the Brexit talks to move on to the next phase. It's also possible that this latest plan will fall foul of her Belfast allies and indeed, some figures in her own party. A senior source told me on Thursday: ""If she can't solve it in the next couple of days, how could she solve it in the next month?.""

"The winning city was announced in the current UK City of Culture, Hull Coventry has been chosen to be the UK's City of Culture for 2021. The bid team said their plans were ""about changing the reputation of a city"" as well as hosting a year of cultural celebration. The title is awarded every four years and Coventry will hope to emulate the success of Hull, which is UK City of Culture this year. The other places in the running for the title were Swansea, Paisley, Stoke-on-Trent and Sunderland. Left-right: Philip Larkin, Delia Derbyshire and The Specials Famous sons and daughters Coventry is the birthplace of Philip Larkin, one of England's finest poets, electronic music pioneer Delia Derbyshire and best-selling author Lee Child. It's also the home of the Two Tone ska movement through bands like The Specials and The Selecter. Cultural claims to fame Venues will include Warwick Arts Centre, the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum and the Belgrade Theatre, which launched the Theatre In Education movement in 1965. It's also the home of the UK's first Shop Front Theatre and boasts the UK's largest free family music festival with the Coventry Godiva Festival. Coventry's bid team said the city had ""constantly reinvented itself to survive"". It has suffered from the decline of its status as the heart of the British motor industry, and it was devastated by bombing during the World War Two. It will hope to learn from Hull, whose status as UK City of Culture has boosted the local economy by an estimated Â£60m. Hull has also seen more than Â£1bn of investment since being chosen to hold the 2017 title four years ago, and the year's artistic programme has been a hit with both residents and critics.

"""Pence you are not welcome"", says graffiti in the West Bank city of Bethlehem The US has warned Palestinians against cancelling talks with Vice-President Mike Pence, after Washington recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. A senior Palestinian official earlier said Mr Pence would not be welcome. It would be ""counterproductive"" to scrap talks between Mr Pence and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas planned later this month, the US said. President Donald Trump's announcement on Jerusalem this week reversed decades of US policy on Jerusalem's status. This video can not be played The Israeli army fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds as Palestinian protesters burned tyres and threw stones in protests on Thursday On Thursday, at least 31 Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the Gaza Strip and across the occupied West Bank. Anger in the West Bank and delight in West Jerusalem The clashes were triggered by Mr Trump's policy shift. More protests are expected in Palestinian territories on Friday, with Israel deploying hundreds of extra troops in the West Bank. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has already called for a new intifada, or uprising. Trump's speech in full Media reacts to 'slap of the century' Five key takeaways from speech Jibril Rajoub, a senior official in Mr Abbas' Fatah party, said on Thursday Mr Pence was ""not welcome"" in the Palestinian territories and that the meeting would not take place. A White House official responded by saying Mr Pence ""still intends to meet Mr Abbas and Palestinian leaders and thinks any decision to pull out of the meeting would be counterproductive"". During his visit - scheduled for the second half of December - Mr Pence will also travel to Israel and Egypt. Mr Abbas has not personally commented on the issue. Mr Trump announced the move on Wednesday,external. The US president said: ""I've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians."" He said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Despite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Mr Trump's right-wing base. This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace Recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""nothing more or less than a recognition of reality"", he added. ""It is also the right thing to do."" Mr Trump said the US would support a two-state solution - shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel - ""if agreed to by both sides"". The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of any future Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was profoundly grateful to Mr Trump, who had ""bound himself forever with the history of the capital"". He also said Israel was ""in touch with other countries to follow suit"". He did not name any of these countries, although the Philippines and the Czech Republic have been mentioned in Israeli media. The mood has been very different on the Palestinian side. The leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniya, which dominates the Gaza Strip, has called for a ""day of rage"" on Friday and said it should ""be the first day of the intifada against the occupier"". This video can not be played Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said the announcement was a ""declaration of war"" Meanwhile, the Fatah party is filing a complaint to the UN Security Council and pushing for a strong stance by the Arab League. ""We are going to declare the United States disqualified as co-sponsor of any peace process or political process,"" spokesman Dr Nasser Al-Kidwa said. ""In our mind, it has lost its ability to do or perform any efforts in this regard."" Which countries condemned Trump's move? There has also been widespread condemnation across the Arab and wider Muslim world, with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning Mr Trump that he was ""throwing the region into a ring of fire"". Many of Washington's closest allies have said they disagree with the US announcement. Both the UN Security Council and the Arab League will meet in the coming days to decide their response. Jerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Why settlement issue is so difficult East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, was annexed by Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, but before now it has not been internationally recognised as part of Israel. According to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.

"The overall pupil absence rate is 4.5%, according to the latest figures from the Department for Education.  One in 10 of those school children are classed as ""persistently absent"". A persistently absent child is one who misses school for at least 10% of the time. Secondary schools had a higher rate of persistent absence than primary schools. And overall, unauthorised absence, whether persistent or not, also increased. Such statistics are just one of the reasons the BBC Stories team decided to look behind the numbers to make a series of films about why children don't attend school. Taking to the streets in cities across the country, the team asked children themselves why they skipped classes. They gave a range of reasons including anxiety, depression, bullying and having little interest in the subjects they are taught. Many said they wanted more support at school and some wished they could go back and ""just start all over again"". This video can not be played 'School's dead man, it's the same lessons every day' According to the Department for Education's latest statistics, sickness was the main reason for absence in the autumn 2016 and spring 2017 terms. But illness rates remained the same as the previous year at 2.7%. Unauthorised absences, however, rose, including unauthorised family holidays. It is important to note that overall school absences in England declined since the same period a decade earlier, as did the percentage of pupils who were persistently absent. Bath and North East Somerset is one of England's wealthiest local authorities But what's most surprising is where truancy was at its highest. While high deprivation indicators based on health, crime, education and crucially income are commonly linked to high truancy, a closer look shows this isn't necessarily the case. Bath and North East Somerset is one of England's wealthiest local authorities, according to deprivation indices, but it had one of the highest levels of truancy in 2015 to 2016. At the other end of the scale Manchester, a city which ranks highly on deprivation levels, had one of the lowest levels of truancy. Manchester had one of the lower levels of truancy If you compare middle income areas, again there are contrasts. Norfolk and Herefordshire are very similar overall when you look at health, crime, education and income but the truancy rate in Norfolk in 2015 to 2016 was much higher than in Herefordshire. So, how reliable is the data? Pupil absence in England is measured at local authority level and deprivation by district so we can only look at the picture as an average with variation within each area. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland record pupil absence in different ways. In Wales, overall absence increased in 2016 to 2017 from the previous year - unauthorised absence and persistent absence also increased. However, persistent absenteeism in Wales was less than half of what is was eight years earlier. In Scotland, attendance rates are recorded only once every two years. In 2014 to 2015, the overall attendance rate improved since the previous report but the unauthorised absence rate also increased. In Northern Ireland, the overall attendance rate in 2015 to 2016 remained unchanged from the previous year at 94.6%. Neither Scotland nor Northern Ireland measure persistent absence.

"This video can not be played Nicholas Hart says his daughter Averil's ""death was avoidable"" A teenager who ""starved to death"" in a matter of weeks was failed by ""every NHS organisation that should have cared for her"", a review has found. Averil Hart, 19, died in 2012 after her anorexia rapidly worsened at university in Norwich. Her father Nicholas said in just 10 weeks she went from being fit and healthy to ""being at death's door"". The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) found her death could and should have been prevented. The NHS services involved say changes have been made, with one saying it accepted the report's findings. Averil Hart went to the University of East Anglia to study creative writing Miss Hart, the youngest of three sisters, from Newton, near Sudbury, became unwell after her A-levels and spent 10 months as an in-patient at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She was discharged to study creative writing at the University of East Anglia. Miss Hart was found collapsed at the university in December 2012 and taken to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital by ambulance but saw no specialist eating disorders clinician for three days after admission, by which time her condition had deteriorated. She was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital on 11 December. Overnight her blood sugar fell to very low levels, but she did not receive appropriate treatment for this and became unconscious, suffering brain damage. She died three days later. Averil Hart's father says his daughter ""literally starved to death"" The ombudsman found Miss Hart did not receive ""appropriate care and treatment"". ""In addition, the local investigation into her death was wholly inadequate with the organisations involved being defensive and protective of themselves, rather than taking responsibility,"" the ombudsman's report said. Miss Hart's father Nicholas Hart, who lives in Newton, near Sudbury, said: ""As a parent I suppose it is a great relief to finally know that the words you knew were true all along and that Averil's death was avoidable. ""It is good to know that the report itself will enable other children and families to potentially not have to go through what we have been through. ""It was a needless death, it did not have to happen. It took only 10 weeks for her to go from fit and healthy to being at death's door."" Averil Hart celebrating her 11th birthday Ombudsman Rob Behrens said: ""Averil's tragic death would have been avoided if the NHS had cared for her appropriately. ""Sadly, these failures, and her family's subsequent fight to get answers, are not unique. ""The families who brought their complaints to us have helped uncover serious issues that require urgent national attention - I hope that our recommendations will mean that no other family will go through the same ordeal."" Dr Bill Kirkup, who led part of the investigation, said: ""I hope this report will act as a wake-up call to the NHS and health leaders to make urgent improvements to services for eating disorders so that we can avoid similar tragedies in the future."" Andrew Radford, chief executive at the eating disorder charity BEAT, said: ""The PHSO report is very clear, if the eating disorder had been recognised earlier and effective and timely care was put in place, Averil Hart's death would have been prevented. ""We await a response from the Government and NHS England who must learn and take action following this tragedy, we cannot continue to fail people with eating disorders. ""We must see good, joined-up intensive home and community-based treatment for people of all ages, and in all locations across the UK. This does require the NHS to reorganise but it will deliver improved outcomes for patients and considerable cost savings to the NHS. ""It is also clear there were multiple failings across the health service in the lead-up to this tragedy, and the behaviour of each responsible part of the NHS in evading and obfuscating justice is appalling, and piled even more distress on an already distraught family. This requires further investigation and action taken to ensure it cannot be repeated. ""This tragedy demonstrates, once again, the devastation eating disorders can cause."" A spokeswoman for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital said: ""We met Averil's family in 2014 to offer our sincere condolences for their sad and devastating loss. ""Since then we have taken into account the learning from this tragic event and our structure and processes have been reviewed."" As well has holding a black belt in karate, Averil Hart had travelled extensively A spokesman for Cambridge University Hospital said: ""The trust would like to repeat the apologies previously made to Averil Hart's family and accepts the findings and recommendations in the ombudsman's report. ""When Averil was transferred to Addenbrooke's in December 2012, she was already very unwell but her death, at that time, may have been avoided had failures in her care not taken place. ""A thorough investigation has been carried out, lessons have been learned from what happened to Averil and a number of changes made."" The Norfolk Community Eating Disorder unit, which was tasked with providing community care to Miss Hart, has been approached for comment but is yet to respond. The University of East Anglia declined to comment on the report, claiming it had ""been informed that legal action is pending subject to the outcome of an inquest"".

"The Â£5 Christmas candle began to burn an hour after it was first lit A picture of a Primark candle bursting into flames has gone viral, after a mother-of-three took to Facebook to raise awareness of the potential hazard. Jenny Ferneyhough purchased the Â£5 candle - which she said developed into ""massive flames"" after an hour of burning - in Manchester on Saturday. The 33-year-old's Facebook post has been shared 145,000 times. Primark said it is removing the product from sale and investigating the matter. Mrs Ferneyhough, a Manchester City Council benefits officer, said she lit the candle - in the shape of a Christmas tree - after putting her three children to bed. She said the flame had spread from the wick to the whole candle within an hour. Jenny Ferneyhough, left, was with her husband Evan when the candle burst into flames She said: ""Obviously everyone knows not to leave a flame unattended, but if you went to the loo, a couple of seconds later it could have burst into flames. ""If it [develops into] a massive flame when anything else is around it, it could be very dangerous."" Speaking to the BBC, she added that she was especially concerned about people lighting the candle ""around neighbouring decorations"" during the festive period. Mrs Ferneyhough sent the pictures to Primark, who replied to say they were ""very concerned"" about the discovery. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A company spokesperson has since said the product is being removed from sale, while the complaint is investigated ""as a matter of urgency"". Mrs Ferneyhough said she was ""reassured"" by the massive response she had received to her post, less than 24 hours after posting the picture. She added the main reason for sharing the pictures was to raise awareness of the potential issue with the candle, and to stop people from lighting it unattended. ""My husband went into the Manchester store to take a picture of the packaging, and a mum and her daughter said they'd seen the photo I shared of it in flames,"" she added.
