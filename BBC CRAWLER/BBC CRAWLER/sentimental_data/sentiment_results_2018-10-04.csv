"The controversial monument represents women forced to work in military brothels Japan's Osaka city has ended its ""sister city"" ties with San Francisco over the display of a statue depicting women forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during World War Two. Osaka mayor Hirofumi Yoshimura said the ""comfort women"" monument ""destroyed the two sides' relationship of trust"". The work depicts three young women - from Korea, China and the Philippines - standing in a circle holding hands. It is estimated that some 200,000 women were kept in these military brothels. The statue on display in San Francisco, which was initially set up privately but officially accepted by the US city last November, is entitled the ""Women's Column of Strength"". It represents the women who worked in the brothels at the time, including some who were reportedlylured with the offer of paid work as cooks or cleaners,external, according to a UN report. 'Comfort women' - a painful legacy Bad blood between Japan and Korea persists Mr Yoshimura's decision to end Osaka's sisterhood with the city, which dates back to 1957, was first announced in November, but the move was delayed following the death of San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee in December. Lee was later replaced by London Breed, the city's first female black mayor. Mr Yoshimura set out the reasons for his decision in a 10-page letter,externalto Ms Breed, saying that part of the ""problem"" was the monument's inscription, which he said ""presents uncertain and one-sided claims as historical facts"". ""There is also disagreement among historians when regarding the historical facts such as the number of 'comfort women', the degree to which the former Japanese army was involved, and the extent of the wartime harm"", his letter adds. The fourth figure (left) represents the first woman to speak out about her experience In a statement, Mayor Breed said it was impossible to cut the ties between the two cities, which have enjoyed a relationship ""for over 60 years"". ""One mayor cannot unilaterally end a relationship that exists between the people of our two cities,"" she said. The full inscription on the side of the statue reads: ""This monument bears witness to the suffering of hundreds of thousands of women and girls euphemistically called 'comfort women', who were sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial armed forces in 13 Asian-Pacific countries from 1931 to 1945."" The monument also includes a fourth figure who stands nearby, depicting an elderly woman meant to be Kim Hak-sun, the first woman to speak out about her experience during the Japanese occupation of Korea during the war. The San Francisco mayor's statement went on to say the memorial is ""a symbol of the struggle faced by all women who have been, and are currently, forced to endure the horrors of enslavement and sex trafficking.

"An eight-year-old found a pre-Viking-era sword while swimming in a lake in Sweden during the summer. Saga Vanecek found the relic in the Vidostern lake while at her family's holiday home in Jonkoping County. The sword was initially reported to be 1,000 years old, but experts at the local museum now believe it may date to around 1,500 years ago. ""It's not every day that you step on a sword in the lake!"" Mikael Nordstrom from the museum said. This video can not be played Saga Vanecek: ""I noticed something that felt like a stick"" The level of the water was extremely low at the time, owing to a drought, which is probably why Saga uncovered the ancient weapon. ""I felt something in the water and lifted it up. Then there was a handle and I went to tell my dad that it looked like a sword,"" Saga told the broadcaster Sveriges Television. Saga's father Andy Vanecek told the English-language website The Local he initially thought his daughter had found an unusual stick or branch in the water. Roman road discovered in Dutch town Drugs trace find inside Bronze Age jug Nursery to teach 'Viking language' It was only after he asked a friend to take a closer look did he discover that it was likely to be an ancient relic. The local museum, where the sword is now being kept, said it was extremely well-preserved. Further excavations have revealed more ancient items lurk at the bottom of the lake Saga's discovery led the museum and local council to carry out further excavations at the site, finding a brooch from the 3rd Century. The Jonkoping county museum said that its investigation of the lake is unfinished and it could yet turn up more ancient items.

"This video can not be played Footage shows former rap label boss Marion ""Suge"" Knight running over two men with his pick-up truck - the man in this clip survived Ex-rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight showed no emotion as he was sentenced for a hit-and-run amid emotional statements from his victim's family. The daughter of one victim called Knight ""truly a disgusting, selfish disgrace to the human species"" as Knight received 28 years behind bars. In September, Knight pleaded no contest to a 2015 fatal hit-and-run on the set of the film Straight Outta Compton. His record label helped launch rappers including Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg. The 55-year-old founder of Death Row Records had reached a plea deal last month with investigators over the driving attack, which left one man dead and another with serious injuries. The deal allowed him to avoid charges of murder and attempted murder with his pick-up truck in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Compton. The incident happened after an argument over the making of Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about rap group NWA. Plea deal for hit-and-run rap mogul Crystal Carter, a daughter of victim Terry Carter, addressed Knight during the hearing in an LA courthouse on Thursday. ""You're unrepentant,"" Ms Carter said. ""Your callous actions took my dad's life away."" She told the judge that Knight deserved more than 28 years in jail. Suge Knight says Tupac may be alive Six of the most notorious execs in music How rock and rap combined to create Beats ""He is truly a disgusting, selfish disgrace to the human species,""she said,external. ""He murdered my dad in cold blood and is a menace to society."" Mr Carter's widow told local media that thinking about the crime still makes her ""feel numb"". ""I really don't want him to ever leave jail. I hope he spends the rest of his life there,"" she said. Throughout the sentencing hearing, Knight sat silently wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and a large crucifix. Sales and profits for Knight's Death Row Records declined after he was imprisoned in 1996 The maximum penalty for voluntary manslaughter in California is 11 years. But the sentence was doubled because of Knight's prior convictions under the state's three-strikes law, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said. Footage of the incident captured by security cameras show Knight's vehicle pulling up to the drive-in hamburger shop, with one of the victims approaching the driver's side window. Following what appears to be a brief discussion, a struggle then ensues. Knight's truck is seen going into reverse, throwing the man to the ground. It then moves forward, driving over his legs and slams into the other victim, who was killed. Knight turned himself in to authorities a day after the incident. His attorneys had said he was acting in self-defence and was fleeing armed attackers when he ran over Mr Carter and Cle ""Bone"" Sloan. Mr Sloan denied claims he was carrying a gun during the confrontation.

"Hundreds of tonnes of human body parts and medical waste is piling up after a disposal company working for the NHS has struggled to incinerate it. The government confirmed the waste had not been properly disposed of by Healthcare Environmental Services. A spokeswoman said there was no risk to the public, but the waste material had not been incinerated in a timely fashion. The anatomical waste is stored on sites in secure and refrigerated containers. The contractor removes the waste from a significant number, but not all, hospitals in England and Scotland. It is understood that the Environment Agency has been putting pressure on the company to dispose of the backlog but that rules on incineration have limited the amount which can be dealt with. A ministerial meeting last month discussed contingency plans for alternative disposal arrangements, but for now the contractor in question is being allowed to continue collecting the waste. The firm is being closely monitored by the Environment Agency, which first raised the alarm about the problem at the end of July, the government said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We are monitoring the situation closely and have made sure that public services - including NHS Trusts - have contingency plans in place. ""There is absolutely no risk to the health of patients or the wider public. ""Our priority is to prevent disruption to the NHS and other vital public services and work is underway to ensure organisations can continue to dispose of their waste safely and efficiently."" Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, said the situation was ""simply horrific"", saying it was ""unlikely that such a distressing situation would have happened had the service remained in-house"". She added: ""Ethics and decent behaviour aside, it begs the question as to why services that are such a crucial part of the NHS are ever outsourced in the first place."" The BBC has contacted Healthcare Environmental Services for comment. The Health Service Journal, which first reported the story, is reporting the company is blaming a lack of ""incineration capacity in the market"" and desire to reduce use of landfill. The statement given to the journal said all waste companies have been affected and the firm had been ""consistently"" highlighting these issues to regulators.

"This video can not be played Tusk: Comparing EU with Soviet Union 'unwise and insulting' Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's jibe likening the EU to the Soviet Union was ""as unwise as it is insulting"", the president of the European Council says. Donald Tusk called for ""respect"", saying as someone who spent half his life in the Soviet bloc: ""I know what I am talking about."" Asked if Mr Hunt, who made the comments at the Tory conference, should resign, he replied: ""That's not my problem."" He also said a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU remained on the table. Hunt 'must apologise' for EU-Soviet jibe May demands respect from EU in Brexit talks Addressing Conservatives at the party conference in Birmingham, Mr Hunt accused the EU of seeking to punish the UK in order to ""keep the club together"". His speech recalled a visit to Latvia earlier this summer and the role that the UK and others played in helping it transition from Soviet rule to becoming a modern democracy and market economy. ""What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?"" he asked. ""The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving."" Please upgrade your browser He has since faced calls to apologise from several EU ambassadors. At a press briefing in Brussels, Mr Tusk - the former prime minister of Poland - said: ""In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return. ""Comparing the EU to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. ""The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours. ""The European Union is about freedom and human rights, prosperity and peace, life without fear, it is about democracy and pluralism - a continent without internal borders and walls. ""As the president of the European Council and someone who spent half his life in the Soviet bloc, I know what I am talking about."" At last month's EU summit in Salzburg, Mr Tusk rejected Theresa May's Brexit proposals and sparked anger among some Tories with an Instagram post apparently poking fun at the prime minister and suggesting she was ""cherry picking"". The day after the summit Mrs May called for ""respect"" from the EU towards the UK side. Mr Tusk - after his criticism of Mr Hunt's comments and his own call for respect to be shown -  added: ""Telling the truth, even if difficult and unpleasant, is the best way of showing respect for partners, that's how it was in Salzburg and that's also how it will work in the coming days."" He added: ""Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound attractive but they do not facilitate agreement."" The UK is due to leave the EU in March, but the two sides have not yet reached a deal on how this will work. Mr Tusk said that now the Conservative Party conference had ended, ""we should get down to business"". And in a remark that was welcomed by some Eurosceptics who want to scrap Mrs May's proposed trade plans, he said the EU remained open to a ""Canada plus plus plus"" deal - a reference to the EU's free trade deal with Canada. This would be ""much further reaching on trade, on internal security and on foreign policy co-operation"" than Canada's arrangement, he said.

Reality Check: Red lines on the Irish border But Mrs May has said a deal like Canada's would not prevent a visible, physical border being needed in Northern Ireland - a key commitment of both sides - because of the extra checks that would be needed on goods. The EU has proposed a ""backstop"" plan to keep the border open - under which Northern Ireland would remain aligned to some EU rules. But this has been rejected by Mrs May who says the arrangement would carve up the UK and create a new border in the Irish sea. Irish PM Mr Varadkar said that it could take longer than the length of the post-Brexit transition period, due to run to 31 December 2020, to agree a final EU-UK trade deal. ""What I do know is that we need a backstop, a protocol on Ireland and N Ireland as part of a withdrawal agreement,"" he said. However, he added: ""I think we are entering a critical and decisive stage of these negotiations and there is a good opportunity to clinch a deal over the next couple of weeks."" UK ministers have suggested new proposals for a border backstop are being prepared. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said UK officials were understood to be working on plans for a ""hybrid backstop"" with light-touch regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the possibility of some kind of democratic oversight from Stormont and a temporary extension of the customs union to the whole of the UK in the event that a free trade deal has not been completed. There is no official confirmation of the plans or when the proposals will be presented to the EU, she added. The deputy leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, Nigel Dodds,told the BBChis party could not accept a ""separate hybrid model"" in which Northern Ireland is in the EU single market but out of its customs union. And asked about the prospect of ""light touch regulatory checks"" between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Mr Dodds asked why such techniques could not be used on the land frontier in Ireland.

"An eight-year-old found a pre-Viking-era sword while swimming in a lake in Sweden during the summer. Saga Vanecek found the relic in the Vidostern lake while at her family's holiday home in Jonkoping County. The sword was initially reported to be 1,000 years old, but experts at the local museum now believe it may date to around 1,500 years ago. ""It's not every day that you step on a sword in the lake!"" Mikael Nordstrom from the museum said. This video can not be played Saga Vanecek: ""I noticed something that felt like a stick"" The level of the water was extremely low at the time, owing to a drought, which is probably why Saga uncovered the ancient weapon. ""I felt something in the water and lifted it up. Then there was a handle and I went to tell my dad that it looked like a sword,"" Saga told the broadcaster Sveriges Television. Saga's father Andy Vanecek told the English-language website The Local he initially thought his daughter had found an unusual stick or branch in the water. Roman road discovered in Dutch town Drugs trace find inside Bronze Age jug Nursery to teach 'Viking language' It was only after he asked a friend to take a closer look did he discover that it was likely to be an ancient relic. The local museum, where the sword is now being kept, said it was extremely well-preserved. Further excavations have revealed more ancient items lurk at the bottom of the lake Saga's discovery led the museum and local council to carry out further excavations at the site, finding a brooch from the 3rd Century. The Jonkoping county museum said that its investigation of the lake is unfinished and it could yet turn up more ancient items.

"The firm that owns viral news website Unilad has gone into administration, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Bentley Harrington has debts of Â£6.5m, including owing Â£1.5m to UK tax authorities. The Unilad Facebook account has 39 million followers and posts viral videos and news stories. A Â£10m joint bid for the company has been made by Linton Capital, whose partner David Sefton said he had ""known the company for quite a while."" Rocket Sports, which chief executive Will Muirhead describes as ""a network of 300 biased football news creators"" on social media, is part of the joint bid. The offer of Â£10m in cash, which Mr Sefton said has been secured, would go to paying back creditors at 100p in the pound, he said. He added that Unilad was attractive as a business as it pulled in ""core programmatic revenue"" of between Â£6m and Â£7m per year. Unilad, which has offices in London and Manchester, was founded in 2010. It was shut down in 2012, but relaunched in 2014 under new owners Liam Harrington and Sam Bentley. It was named as one of Facebook's most popular pages last year. Manchester-based administrators Leonard Curtis Business Rescue and Recovery say they are ""seeking offers for the business in order to preserve jobs and maximise the return to creditors"". Mr Sefton said he was aware of other parties who were interested in bidding, but as far as he was aware, his was the first formal bid. It is understood that Unilad employs more than 200 people. Administration came after a hearing at a specialist Insolvency and Companies Court in London, where Judge Clive Jones heard that a creditor and directors of the firm agreed that administrators should be appointed. HM Revenue and Customs officials were also not against administrators being appointed. Unilad founder Alex Partridge told the court he was owed Â£5m and argued for the company to be placed into administration. Lawyers for Bentley Harrington had initially argued against administration, but withdrew their objections. HM Revenue and Customs officials have issued a petition to wind up Bentley Harrington in separate litigation, with that case coming to court on 31 October.

"Megan Lee from Oswaldtwistle died two days after she was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital A 15-year-old girl was unlawfully killed when she unknowingly ate a takeaway meal containing peanuts, a court has heard. Megan Lee died on 1 January 2017 from acute asthma brought on by an allergic reaction to food from the Royal Spice Takeaway in Hyndburn, Lancashire. Her friend wrote ""prawns, nuts"" on the Just Eat online order, but staff paid no attention to it, the jury heard. Takeaway owner Mohammed Kuddus and co-accused Harun Rashid deny manslaughter. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said staff served a meal including an onion bhaji, a Peshwari naan and a seekh kebab which tests later showed had the ""widespread presence"" of peanut protein. Megan Lee died two days after eating food from the Royal Spice restaurant After the delivery was dropped off at her friend's house, the girls shared the food but Megan suffered an ""immediate reaction"" when she began to eat the kebab. Her friend noted Megan appeared ""lumpy"" and the friend's mum gave her some liquid antihistamine, which made her feel better. Megan left the kebab but continued eating and, aside for a rash on her cheek, showed no signs of discomfort when her mum, Gemma, took her home. Mr Wright said Megan went upstairs to her bedroom but shortly after Mrs Lee heard her daughter call out. He said: ""Megan was in a state of distress. Her lips were swollen and blue, she was struggling to breathe and an ambulance was called. Megan's condition continued to deteriorate. She stopped breathing and her heart stopped."" Mrs Lee and paramedics tried to revive Megan but she had suffered irreversible brain damage and was pronounced dead two days later when her life support was switched off, the prosecutor said. A police investigation was launched as well as a probe by local Trading Standards and environmental health officers who closed the takeaway. Mr Wright said there were ""no procedures in place"" to manage foods known to cause allergic reactions and ""no audit of their available dishes or written records of their recipes"". He said the premises were not clean and evidence of mouse droppings was found. Samples of the dishes were tested and detected the ""widespread presence of peanut protein of levels that were unsafe for people allergic to peanuts"", Mr Wright said. Mr Kuddus, 40, of Belper Street, Blackburn, earlier pleaded guilty to failing to discharge a general duty of employers, contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act. He also admitted failing to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures in contravention of European Union food safety regulations. Mr Kuddus also entered guilty pleas to the same offences on behalf of Royal Spice Takeaway Limited, trading as Royal Spice Takeaway. His co-defendant, fellow Bangladeshi national Rashid, 38, of Rudd Street, Haslingden, pleaded not guilty to those charges. The trial continues.

"Thousands of O2 customers in the UK have reported problems making and taking phone calls. Many logged the difficulty they had using the network via online sites that keep an eye on the status of the UK's telecoms systems. The problems were logged by customers all over the UK. O2 said the initial problem had been fixed, but that customers may still have some ""intermittent issues"" when reconnecting to the network. The volume of people trying to reconnect to the network continued to overload it at certain points, but it was expected that normal service would resume on Thursday evening, an O2 spokesman said.

The spokesman added: ""Some customers may continue to experience some intermittent issues when reconnecting to the network. ""We're investigating what happened and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused,"" he said. It is not yet clear what caused the problem but many people reported that it suddenly became impossible to make calls. The first messages about issues were posted at about 16:00 BST with some saying that the system had stopped working in the middle of a conversation.

Judge Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all allegations against him. A confirmation vote is expected on Saturday. His appointment would tilt the court in favour of conservatives. The court's nine justices are appointed for life and have the final say on some of the most contentious issues in US public life, from abortion to gun control and voting laws. WATCH: Trump supporters brand Ford a liar The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words The truth about lie detector tests Given Republicans slender 51-49 majority in the Senate, the nominee's fate has hinged on five undecided senators - three Republicans and two Democrats. Republicans have accused Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh in the hope they will make gains in the mid-term elections in November and stop his appointment altogether. As senators feuded over the report's findings, police began arresting more than 300 protesters who had gathered in a Senate office building to oppose the nominee. During a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said: ""We're just about 48 hours away from having a new person the Supreme Court."" In a statement earlier after reading the report,external, he said the FBI had ""found no hint of misconduct"". Activists have gathered in the Senate office building to protest Judge Kavanaugh's nomination The report contains summaries of interviews that the FBI has conducted. Nine people were reportedly interviewed, but not Judge Kavanaugh, 53, or the woman who first accused him of sexual assault. It is in paper format only and no copies will be made. It is being held in a secure room in the basement of the Capitol building, known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or ""Skif"". Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Simple guide to mid-term elections Senators have been told not to reveal its contents, but some have already begun to describe its findings. Senator Bob Corker said the report is 46 pages long. This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault Democrats have raised concerns the investigation has been too narrow in scope, with key witnesses not interviewed. In a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday, the lawyers for the first woman accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, criticised investigators for not speaking with more than a dozen alleged witnesses whose names she provided. Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona - like other Republicans - said the report contained ""no additional corroborating information"". Moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine said it ""appears very thorough"". Another key Republican Senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told Bloomberg she did not believe that if confirmed Judge Kavanaugh would overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalised abortion in the US. They have yet to reveal their voting intentions. A closely watched Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, said on Thursday afternoon she would vote against the nominee. ""In addition to the concerns about his past conduct,"" she said in a statement, ""last Thursday's hearing called into question Judge Kavanaugh's current temperament, honesty, and impartiality."" Another key Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has yet to declare whether he will support the nominee. If all Democrats vote against confirming Judge Kavanaugh, Republicans can only afford one defection - since in a tie, Vice-President Mike Pence would have the casting vote. Anti-Kavanaugh protesters rally outside the US Supreme Court Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Six days later, the Senate is where it was before the reopened FBI background check of Brett Kavanaugh began. The confirmation vote was, at its heart, a political decision then. It's a political decision now. The conservative president has his conservative nominee, and the conservative majority in the Senate is predisposed to put that man on the Supreme Court for life. The biggest sign that this process is heading toward a successful conclusion for Judge Kavanaugh is that, with the investigation concluded, Democrats are fighting about the process by which it was conducted. If there were some explosive revelation, it would have been blasted from the rooftops by now. Instead, key on-the-fence Republicans like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins are dropping hints they are satisfied with the results. The Senate procedural machinery is grinding toward a final weekend vote. After all the tumult of the past few days, Judge Kavanaugh could be Justice Kavanaugh by the time the Supreme Court reconvenes next week. Last week Prof Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Brett Kavanaugh had assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. She said he was drunk and had pinned her on to a bed, tried to remove her clothing and put his hand over her mouth when she screamed. Are young men in America scared? Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking The women who confronted Jeff Flake Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, has accused the nominee of exposing himself to her during a drinking game when they were students at Yale University in the 1980s. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her After Prof Ford's testimony, the Senate panel approved Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, but asked for the FBI to conduct further inquiry before the full chamber voted on his appointment to America's top court. However, the FBI did not examine allegations made by a third woman, Julie Swetnick, that Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. He has described that allegation as a ""joke"". The remit of the FBI investigation came from the White House, and some US media reports have said it decided not to ask the FBI to interview Prof Ford or Judge Kavanaugh. The White House Counsel's office believes thatthe sworn testimony from both in front of the Senate committee last week is sufficient,external, CNN reported.

"This video can not be played Footage of Zakaria's arrest was released by police after his conviction A drug dealer who trafficked teenagers to sell heroin and crack cocaine through his ""county lines"" narcotics network has been jailed for 14 years. Zakaria Mohammed, 21, groomed them before transporting them from Birmingham to rural Lincolnshire. West Midlands Police said it was the first time a drug dealer had been convicted, under the Modern Slavery Act, of trafficking children. He admitted conspiracy to supply class A drugs and trafficking charges. Police said Mohammed, from Aston in Birmingham, was ""cynical, deliberate and ruthless"" in befriending young and vulnerable children, aged 14 and 15 at the time, to use as a commodity to further his drug-dealing business. Children, who had previously been reported as missing to the force, were found inside three flats in Lincoln when police conducted raids and recovered money, drugs and weapons. ""Dishevelled"" children were found living in one flat with no food or heating At least one flat was described as ""unsanitary"", littered with drug paraphernalia, with no heating or food, despite police believing Mohammed was making as much as Â£500 a day. Latest news and updates in the West Midlands Although it is believed that as many as 10 children were involved, Mohammed was prosecuted for trafficking two boys who were found in a flat and a girl he bought a train ticket to Lincoln for. Passing sentence at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Nicholas Webb said: ""The fact is the children were being taken away for days or weeks, exposed to potential danger in a squalid environment."" Mohammed had a ""significant"" role which he was carrying out in order to pay off a drugs debt. ""Your contribution was to exploit their vulnerability,"" the judge said. Drugs were found at some flats along with weapons, police said Officers launched an investigation with Lincolnshire Police after two 15-year-old boys who were reported missing from their Birmingham homes were found in a flat in Yarborough Road, on 25 January. Subsequent surveillance identified a Seat Leon registered in Mohammed's name making regular trips from Birmingham, often with teenagers, to an address in Lincoln, police said. He was stopped in his vehicle by police in February, which led officers to finding a phone to run the drugs line, called ""Castro"", which contained more than 100 customer contacts. The car also had school uniform trousers, a white shirt and school tie inside it belonging to a missing child from Birmingham. Children were filmed distributing drugs in Lincoln Forensic tests on two soft drinks in the vehicle gave a DNA match to two other 15-year-old boys who had been reported missing from the city. With his car impounded, Mohammed was later seen taking taxis with children to Lincoln and filmed on CCTV at Birmingham's New Street station in March buying train tickets for a boy and a girl. Lincolnshire Police filmed children passing on the drugs to customers, with some transactions occurring as regularly as every 10 or 15 minutes. By Sima Kotecha, Midlands correspondent West Midlands Police is happy to publicise this case as the force believes it's been triumphant in bringing Mohammed to justice. However, charities have told BBC News this type of trafficking is going on much more than we might think and the authorities need to be ""sharper"" in finding those responsible. Children involved are vulnerable and scared and it's very unlikely that they'll go to the authorities themselves, placing more responsibility on the intelligence services and police to rescue them. This landmark case highlights how behind closed doors, even in the 21st Century, children are being exploited and treated like slaves, and even once they're found, the mental scarring of the nightmare they lived is unlikely to ever fade. The children in this case were never prosecuted for dealing drugs, instead they were seen as victims of grooming who were promised the world - and given squalor instead. Mohammed was eventually arrested while driving in Lincoln. Police said he was ""a very busy man, living the life of a travelling salesman, sleeping in service stations and out on the road for many hours each day taking drugs and phones to children"". Supt Richard Agar said: ""He befriended these children... with one end in mind and that was [to] exploit them. ""He didn't see them as individuals. He saw them as a commodity. He didn't recognise their humanity."" The phrase ""county lines"" refers to the phone line used by inner-city gangs to either set up and run, or take over drug-dealing businesses in smaller towns and cities. Mohammed previously admitted four counts of conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine and five counts of arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to exploitation.

"A team of Russians allegedly tried to compromise and disrupt computers at the OPCW (file photo) Four Russians, a car full of electronic equipment, and a foiled plot to hack the world's foremost chemical weapons watchdog. The Dutch security services say Russia planned a cyber-attack on the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague earlier this year. At a press conference on Thursday, Defence Minister Ank Bijleveld said the plan was thwarted with the help of officials from the UK. Russia has described the allegations as a ""diabolical cocktail"" and a ""rich fantasy"". Here is what we know about the alleged plot so far. The four suspects travelled on diplomatic passports Dutch and British officials have named four Russians they say are agents in a GRU intelligence cyber warfare team. Specifically, GRU's Unit 26165, which has also been known as APT 28 and has been accused of conducting cyber operations around the world. Alexei Morenets, 41, and Yevgeny Serebriakov, 37, were described by officials as ""cyber-operators"". Oleg Sotnikov and Alexei Minin - both aged 46 - were also named as support agents. They allegedly travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports and arrived in the country on April 10. ""They were clearly not here on holiday,"" the head of the Dutch intelligence service said on Thursday. The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia What happened to the Skripals? Russia 'tried to hack Foreign Office' Yevgeny Serebriakov's laptop was ultimately seized by the authorities, and his search history showed he had researched the OPCW building and its surroundings. It also included a picture of him at the Olympic games in Brazil in 2016 alongside an unidentified Russian athlete. Yevgeny Serebriakov pictured at the Olympic Games in 2016 The OPCW has been investigating the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK. Authorities believe Mr Skripal's door in the city of Salisbury was targeted with the nerve agent Novichok. The organisation was also examining an alleged chemical attack by Syria's Russian-backed military in Douma. The OPCW is the world's top chemical weapons watchdog, and in June granted itself new powers to assign blame for attacks despite protests by Russia. At the time, Russia said the organisation was going beyond its mandate and Industry Minister Georgy Kalamonov said it was like a ""sinking ship"". After arriving in the country, the team of Russians hired a grey Citroen C3 car and were seen scouting the area around the OPCW building. Alexei Minin's recovered camera shows a number of reconnaissance photographs of the area which were taken on 11 April. All the while the group were being closely monitored by the Dutch intelligence service. They planned to carry out a closed access hack operation targeting the OPCW's wifi network, officials say. In the rear of the car they had set up specialist equipment for doing this, and parked the vehicle in the car park of a nearby Marriot hotel. The equipment included an antenna which was hidden under a waterproof jacket and aimed at the OPCW office. This was being used to intercept login details, Maj Gen Onno Eichelsheim from the Dutch MIVD intelligence service said. The goal was to compromise and disrupt computers in the building, officials say. They then planned to travel to Switzerland on 17 April, as shown by train tickets that were in their possession, but they were intercepted before they could leave. Mark Ward, technology correspondent Close or ""drive-by"" attacks on wi-fi networks are well known in the cyber-security world. They are an established technique for penetrating a target. They work well because some wi-fi hotspots can harbour hardware weaknesses that can be exploited to grab traffic. Some run third-party software that can contain vulnerabilities. There have also been instances of hotspot makers picking passcodes that are easy to generate. And researchers have demonstrated fundamental weaknesses in the protocols used to create hardened passcodes. Then there are the issues with the way wi-fi works, which make it possible to force gadgets that use wireless to hop onto fake, copycat networks. All of this would be well known to the average nation-state-backed hacker. The group were being continually monitored by the intelligence services, and were eventually intercepted by the authorities on 13 April. When this happened they tried to destroy one of the mobile phones they were carrying, which officials say shows their heightened awareness of security. They had also collected their litter from the hotel they were staying at, also allegedly for security reasons. The four men were detained and expelled to Moscow rather than being arrested. This is probably because they had diplomatic passports and, under the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats are theoretically immune from prosecution. They were escorted to Schiphol airport and put on a plane without any of their items, and the intelligence services were in charge of the operation. ""The decision taken at the time of catching the operatives was to disrupt as quickly as possible so we deported them, it was not a police operation,"" the director of the Dutch intelligence service said. As well as the specialist equipment in the car, Yevgeny Serebriakov's laptop was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia. In Malaysia it was used to target the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Earlier this year Dutch-led international investigators concluded that the missile belonged to a Russian brigade. Russia has denied any involvement in the plane's destruction. Separate data from the laptop showed it was also present in the Swiss city of Lausanne where it was linked to the hacking of a laptop belonging to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which has exposed the taking of performance-enhancing drugs by Russian athletes. Officials also found Alexei Morenets's taxi receipt, which showed he had travelled from the GRU headquarters to a Moscow airport on 10 April - the day they arrived in the Netherlands. There were also a number of print-outs from Google Maps showing Russian diplomatic buildings in Switzerland, where they had planned to travel.

"When Theresa May addressed MPs on 5 September - revealing the identities of two Russian agents suspected of the Salisbury poisoning - she said the UK and its allies would step up their collective efforts against the country's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU. In particular, she promised to deploy what she called ""the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus in order to counter the threat posed by the GRU."" Well, we now know what she means. And the biggest tool in her box is what officials call the shining light of transparency. West accuses Russia of global cyber-plots How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' Russia 'tried to hack Foreign Office' What is the GRU? The revelations about how the British and Dutch security agencies disrupted the operations of the GRU are astonishing in their detail and their openness. This is not what secretive intelligence agencies normally do. But the willingness of both countries to be so candid illustrates how determined both they and some other western governments are to try to push back against what they see as a concerted pattern of Russian aggression. ""I imagine Mr Putin is shouting at one or two people right now,"" a cheerful British official told me. After the Salisbury poisonings, the British government scored a significant diplomatic success in persuading 28 countries to expel more than 150 Russian diplomats and intelligence agents. Officials believe the scale of that joint action against Russia took the Kremlin by surprise and put them on the back foot. The UK then went further, revealing the identities and pictures of the two Russian military intelligence officers that it believes were responsible for poisoning the Skripals. And now, the UK and the Dutch governments have revealed a huge amount of new intelligence about how the GRU has been operating across the world, namely its attempts to hack the OPCW chemical weapons inspectors' headquarters in the Hague, the computers of the Foreign Office in London and the work of the Porton Down military laboratories in Wiltshire. Russian diplomats were expelled from their UK embassy in March The aim of this highly unusual openness is to counter Russian behaviour by exposing their operations to the world. As the UK ambassador to The Hague, Peter Wilson, said, the GRU operates in the shadows so the West must do more to shine a light on their activities. In other words, officials hope that Russia will know that if it carries out attacks like this again, there will be a price to be paid of further international opprobrium. The revelations of the Hague operation do not just illustrate international co-operation, but also reveal the extent of western intelligence capabilities. This shows Moscow - and other European capitals - what can be done when they are targeted by what officials describe as malign Russian activities. But as well as this rare openness about joint intelligence, what was also surprising was the scale of the international co-operation. The UK and the Dutch held a joint press conference with their defence minister and the British ambassador, the British and Dutch prime ministers issued a joint statement, and the Nato secretary general also had a statement ready. Other governments and intelligence agencies will almost certainly have had to agree to the revelation of this information. And the United States charged seven Russian GRU officers for hacking and other crimes. This indicates a growing international willingness to call out Russian intelligence aggression. There will, inevitably, be limits to this cooperation. The Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he would talk to allies about imposing further sanctions on Russia. But some EU countries - like Italy - are reluctant to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow. The Dutch government released CCTV footage of four suspects travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports earlier this year And some are hoping - after Brexit - to exploit Britain's absence from the EU to weaken sanctions next time they have to be agreed. This, though, is something that Britain hopes to avoid, for the wider message that the government wants to send to allies is that the UK will continue to cooperate with its European partners in the fight against Russian aggression after the UK leaves the EU. UK diplomats hope their EU counterparts will have a greater sense of the important role that Britain can play in Europe's security and defence community long after it has left the European Union.

"Peter Wilson (R), the UK ambassador to the Netherlands, was speaking alongside Dutch defence minister Ank Bijleveld (C) after revelations by the Dutch security services Russian cyber intelligence officers tried to hack the UK's Foreign Office, a British diplomat has said. Peter Wilson, the UK ambassador in The Hague, said Russian intelligence officers tried to compromise Foreign Office systems with an attack in March. The accusation comes after Dutch security services said theyexpelled four Russians over a cyber plotagainst the global chemical weapons watchdog. Moscow said the allegations were ""not backed by any proof"". Elsewhere, the US has charged seven Russians with hacking anti-doping agencies and other organisations. The allegations are part of an organised push-back against alleged Russian cyber attacks around the world. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK was discussing further sanctions against Russia with its allies. He said Russia's ""fake news"" was in contrast to ""the hard evidence of Russian military activity"" provided by the joint operations between the Dutch and British governments. Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has written to Mr Hunt calling for an inquiry into alleged Russian interference in UK elections - in particular the EU referendum. In his letter he accused the government of ""ignoring glaring concerns"" and said there had been no response to a parliamentary committee that had asked whether the intelligence services were investigating. Russia 'targeted chemical weapons body' What we know about Russian 'OPCW plot' UK accuses Russian spies of cyber-attacks In a statement with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Theresa May said ""joint operations"" had shone ""further light on the unacceptable cyber activities of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU"". Mrs May said the attempted hack of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) demonstrated the GRU's ""disregard for the global values"". The watchdog, based in the Hague, was examining the 4 March Salisbury attack. Mr Wilson said targeting of the OPCW headquarters in May followed unsuccessful attacks by the GRU on the Foreign Office in March and on the defence laboratories at Porton Down, which was also investigating the Salisbury poisoning, in April. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Russia needed to be confronted with the evidence and that this had to be a ""diplomatic confrontation"". ""What I want is positive relations with Russia but that does mean diplomatically confronting them with the evidence both of what happened in Salisbury and of course the more recent cyber issues that come up,"" he said. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Today's astonishing revelations show how much the UK and its allies are prepared to co-operate to maintain pressure on Russia. The British government could have sat back after it persuaded 28 countries to expel more than 150 Russian diplomats and intelligence agents in the wake of the Salisbury attack. But it went further, revealing the identities and pictures of the two Russia spies it believes were responsible for poisoning the Skripals. And now the UK and the Dutch governments have revealed a huge amount of new intelligence about how the GRU has been operating across the world. The aim of this highly unusual openness is to counter Russian behaviour by exposing their operations to the world. But for the British, there is also a wider message: namely that the UK will continue to co-operate with its European partners in the fight against Russian aggression.

"There will be no service on the Central Line throughout Friday, including the Night Tube London Underground passengers will face 24 hours of disruption on two Tube lines after talks to prevent strike action collapsed. There will be no service on the Central Line or the Waterloo and City Line throughout Friday. The action by the drivers' union Aslef is part of a dispute over working conditions. Talks at the conciliation service Acas broke down on Thursday afternoon without agreement. Aslef's Finn Brennan said the strike action was over a number of issues including ""unsafe"" working practices. ""Drivers are continually forced into overtime and unsafe new working practices are pushed through without agreement,"" he added. ""It would be a dereliction of our duty as trade unionists if we did not take action to stop our members being treated like this."" Members of the Aslef union also plan to strike in November The strike by Central Line drivers will mean the Waterloo and City Line will also be closed for the entire day. This is because the trains are from the same stock and therefore have the same operating system - so all Waterloo and City drivers are also Central Line drivers. A 48-hour strike by rail workers on South Western Railwaywill also begin at 00:01 on Friday, affecting services to London Waterloo. Transport for London advised passengers that Thursday's trains would run as normal until the final service at just after midnight on Friday, but that there will be no service after that - including on the Night Tube which would normally run into Saturday morning. Nigel Holness, director of Network Operations for London Underground, called the strike ""needless"" and apologised to commuters for the ""unnecessary disruption"". He said recent talks between the parties over the action had been ""positive"" but they had ""not been able to agree on the reinstatement of a train driver who was dismissed for a serious breach of our safety regulations."" Another strike is scheduled for 7 November, and members of the RMT union tookindustrial action on the Piccadilly Line last week in a separate row. Fresh 24-hour Tube strike announced Second Piccadilly Line Tube strike begins Transport for London Aslef Richmond named one of the best places to retire with its 'sense of belonging' All London Underground line and stations closed this weekend listed Huge new 46-storey Canary Wharf tower could still be built despite being blocked over noise and crime fears What the papers say â January 9 Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Megan Lee from Oswaldtwistle died two days after she was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital A 15-year-old girl was unlawfully killed when she unknowingly ate a takeaway meal containing peanuts, a court has heard. Megan Lee died on 1 January 2017 from acute asthma brought on by an allergic reaction to food from the Royal Spice Takeaway in Hyndburn, Lancashire. Her friend wrote ""prawns, nuts"" on the Just Eat online order, but staff paid no attention to it, the jury heard. Takeaway owner Mohammed Kuddus and co-accused Harun Rashid deny manslaughter. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said staff served a meal including an onion bhaji, a Peshwari naan and a seekh kebab which tests later showed had the ""widespread presence"" of peanut protein. Megan Lee died two days after eating food from the Royal Spice restaurant After the delivery was dropped off at her friend's house, the girls shared the food but Megan suffered an ""immediate reaction"" when she began to eat the kebab. Her friend noted Megan appeared ""lumpy"" and the friend's mum gave her some liquid antihistamine, which made her feel better. Megan left the kebab but continued eating and, aside for a rash on her cheek, showed no signs of discomfort when her mum, Gemma, took her home. Mr Wright said Megan went upstairs to her bedroom but shortly after Mrs Lee heard her daughter call out. He said: ""Megan was in a state of distress. Her lips were swollen and blue, she was struggling to breathe and an ambulance was called. Megan's condition continued to deteriorate. She stopped breathing and her heart stopped."" Mrs Lee and paramedics tried to revive Megan but she had suffered irreversible brain damage and was pronounced dead two days later when her life support was switched off, the prosecutor said. A police investigation was launched as well as a probe by local Trading Standards and environmental health officers who closed the takeaway. Mr Wright said there were ""no procedures in place"" to manage foods known to cause allergic reactions and ""no audit of their available dishes or written records of their recipes"". He said the premises were not clean and evidence of mouse droppings was found. Samples of the dishes were tested and detected the ""widespread presence of peanut protein of levels that were unsafe for people allergic to peanuts"", Mr Wright said. Mr Kuddus, 40, of Belper Street, Blackburn, earlier pleaded guilty to failing to discharge a general duty of employers, contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act. He also admitted failing to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures in contravention of European Union food safety regulations. Mr Kuddus also entered guilty pleas to the same offences on behalf of Royal Spice Takeaway Limited, trading as Royal Spice Takeaway. His co-defendant, fellow Bangladeshi national Rashid, 38, of Rudd Street, Haslingden, pleaded not guilty to those charges. The trial continues.

"Miguel Alves was one of the first people to escape the Grenfell Tower fire One of the first people to escape the Grenfell Tower said he wished he had warned every floor about the fire. Miguel Alves and his wife Maria returned to the building from a night out at about 01:00 BST and saw the blaze starting on the 4th floor. The couple went up to their 13th floor flat to rescue their children, ignoring advice to stay put, saying it was like ""waiting in a trap"". Mr Alves said: ""It was my duty to help my neighbours, they are my family"". The fire in the early hours of 14 June 2017 claimed the lives of 72 people. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us Grenfell bereaved to decide site's future Mr Alves said after reaching his children, his daughter Ines fled the property with just her revision notes for her chemistry GCSE exam, which she was due to take the following day. The inquiry heard Ines got an A grade in the exam, which prompted the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick to say it was ""astonishing"" that she achieved such a high grade after experiencing such trauma. CCTV showed Mrs Alves getting out of a lift and leaving the building After getting his two children out of the flat, Mr Alves, who had lived in the North Kensington block for 19 years, knocked on the doors of the five other flats on the 13th floor. He said it only took about 15 minutes for the flames to spread from the bottom to the top of the tower. He added: ""The people that live on my floor are like family,  I wish I had the same strength and to go to the top floor and bring everybody down."" On Wednesday, his wife Maria said she was still haunted by guilt because she hadn't buzzed more doorbells. One of the doors Mr Alves knocked on was that of Randa Al-Arasi, who also lived on the 13th floor with her husband Mohammed Ahmed. In a written statement she said she was  ""quite happily, totally unaware"" of the scale of the fire until Mr Alves knocked on their door. ""I was not worried as there was no fire alarms sounding, no sprinklers and no indication of how dangerous the situation I was in was."" When she got to the ground floor  ""almost half of the building was on fire,"" she said. ""I could not believe that we were not warned of the enormity of this fire and to get out,"" she added. Mr Alves said the London Fire Brigade should have evacuated everyone from the tower block immediately. In his written statement he said: ""Looking at the fire on Grenfell Tower, it seemed clear that the fire brigade should have gone to the top of the tower, knocked on all the doors and got people out. ""There was still enough time to evacuate the building and it was clear the fire could not be stopped and that this was the only choice."" Mr Alves said the fire travelled up the tower within 15 minutes At about 01:30 BST Mr Alves called his friend Marcio Gomes, who lived on the 21st floor with his two daughters and wife, who was eight months pregnant. Mr Alves said: ""He did not leave and said he was waiting for the fire brigade, who had told him to stay in the flat. ""I said that there was no way for him to stay and he had to get out. I was terrified for him and his wife. ""I spoke to him in Portuguese and kept saying if he stayed there he was going to die."" Mr Gomes and his family did eventually escape and were treated in hospital. Mr Alves also told the inquiry that he took pictures of cars which obstructed the fire crews' access to the tower on the night of the blaze. He said: ""I was really frustrated about this because I had seen it there many times before and had complained to the council that this kind of parking would block fire engines."" During Thursday's inquiry, Richard Millett QC also read out the written testimony of Shahid Ahmed, who described a fireball coming through his flat window after being woken by the fire alarms. ""As soon as I got to the kitchen and looked down out of the window I saw a big fireball coming up from the outside of the building. It was the colour of a burning sunset. ""I initially thought it must have been a fire in the flat below. The kitchen window then exploded inwards. I was lucky I wasn't close to the window."" The inquiry has been adjourned and will continue on Monday 8 October. To get an in-depth analysis of the inquiry you candownload the The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mairon BBC iPlayer.

"The two men were found dead at Banham Poultry in the early hours Two men have died after a suspected gas leak at a poultry firm in Norfolk. Police were called to Banham Poultry after reports two subcontractors had been found dead at about 01:10 BST. The men, aged in their 30s and 40 and from a pest control company, were found dead close to the factory in Station Road, Attleborough. Police have said a potential refrigeration gas leak near where the men were working was one line of inquiry. Officers said they believed there was no threat to the wider public as result of the gas leak. The fire service, police and the Health and Safety Executive remain at the scene ""in order to understand the circumstances which led to the men's deaths"", it added. A cordon is in place at the factory and at the nearby railway station, where only the Norwich-bound platform is open. Earlier, Greater Anglia said Cambridge-bound trains would not stop at Attleborough because of a ""chemical spillage"" and disruption was expected until further notice. Allow Twitter content?

"False widows are the most dangerous spider species in the UK Four schools have been forced to close because infestations of false widow spiders have been discovered. Ellen Wilkinson Primary School, Star Primary School, Lister Community School and Rokeby School in east London were closed on Wednesday after the finds. False widows are about the size of a 50p coin and are the most dangerous spider species in the UK. Newham Council said it was working with the schools to ensure ""children can continue to receive an education"". The schools are all within a two-mile radius of each other and are being ""treated and fumigated"", theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicereports. A spokeswoman for Newham Council said the closures have been implemented ""at the head teachers' discretion [...], as these infestations were in a number of locations across the school sites"". Lister Community School closed as a precaution after being contacted by Newham Council She said the spiders which ""only bite if mishandled or provoked"" were first discovered on Tuesday. Bites from false widows can cause painful swelling but are not life-threatening. In a letter to parents, Star Primary School said the council's environmental team found the infestation during a routine check and ""believe [it] is contained to the outside of the building and that this needs to be treated immediately before the eggs start hatching"". ""Pupils are being set work via the schools and will remain in contact with schools,"" a council spokeswoman said. Anne-Marie Fenttiman says she is lucky she ""can be here"" for her son Mitchell Anne-Marie Fenttiman, 36, whose son Mitchell goes to Rokeby School, said: ""My son is upset, he just started school and he likes being there. ""Luckily, I'm a stay-home mum so I can be here with him. It would be very different if we both worked full-time - as many other parents do."" Ms Fenttiman, from Canning Town, said her friend was bitten by a false widow earlier this year and told her he was ""in hospital for two days and still blisters and flares up"". How to spider-proof your home False widow spider 'devours' native lizard Man put in coma after spider bite Ellen Wilkinson Primary School in Beckton said in a letter it expects to be closed for most of next week. Star Primary School in Canning Town said in a letter to parents it would provide an update on the length of the closure on its website next week. Lister Community School in Plaistow hopes to be open by Friday while Rokeby School in Canning Town will be closed until 29 October.

"When Theresa May addressed MPs on 5 September - revealing the identities of two Russian agents suspected of the Salisbury poisoning - she said the UK and its allies would step up their collective efforts against the country's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU. In particular, she promised to deploy what she called ""the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus in order to counter the threat posed by the GRU."" Well, we now know what she means. And the biggest tool in her box is what officials call the shining light of transparency. West accuses Russia of global cyber-plots How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' Russia 'tried to hack Foreign Office' What is the GRU? The revelations about how the British and Dutch security agencies disrupted the operations of the GRU are astonishing in their detail and their openness. This is not what secretive intelligence agencies normally do. But the willingness of both countries to be so candid illustrates how determined both they and some other western governments are to try to push back against what they see as a concerted pattern of Russian aggression. ""I imagine Mr Putin is shouting at one or two people right now,"" a cheerful British official told me. After the Salisbury poisonings, the British government scored a significant diplomatic success in persuading 28 countries to expel more than 150 Russian diplomats and intelligence agents. Officials believe the scale of that joint action against Russia took the Kremlin by surprise and put them on the back foot. The UK then went further, revealing the identities and pictures of the two Russian military intelligence officers that it believes were responsible for poisoning the Skripals. And now, the UK and the Dutch governments have revealed a huge amount of new intelligence about how the GRU has been operating across the world, namely its attempts to hack the OPCW chemical weapons inspectors' headquarters in the Hague, the computers of the Foreign Office in London and the work of the Porton Down military laboratories in Wiltshire. Russian diplomats were expelled from their UK embassy in March The aim of this highly unusual openness is to counter Russian behaviour by exposing their operations to the world. As the UK ambassador to The Hague, Peter Wilson, said, the GRU operates in the shadows so the West must do more to shine a light on their activities. In other words, officials hope that Russia will know that if it carries out attacks like this again, there will be a price to be paid of further international opprobrium. The revelations of the Hague operation do not just illustrate international co-operation, but also reveal the extent of western intelligence capabilities. This shows Moscow - and other European capitals - what can be done when they are targeted by what officials describe as malign Russian activities. But as well as this rare openness about joint intelligence, what was also surprising was the scale of the international co-operation. The UK and the Dutch held a joint press conference with their defence minister and the British ambassador, the British and Dutch prime ministers issued a joint statement, and the Nato secretary general also had a statement ready. Other governments and intelligence agencies will almost certainly have had to agree to the revelation of this information. And the United States charged seven Russian GRU officers for hacking and other crimes. This indicates a growing international willingness to call out Russian intelligence aggression. There will, inevitably, be limits to this cooperation. The Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he would talk to allies about imposing further sanctions on Russia. But some EU countries - like Italy - are reluctant to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow. The Dutch government released CCTV footage of four suspects travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports earlier this year And some are hoping - after Brexit - to exploit Britain's absence from the EU to weaken sanctions next time they have to be agreed. This, though, is something that Britain hopes to avoid, for the wider message that the government wants to send to allies is that the UK will continue to cooperate with its European partners in the fight against Russian aggression after the UK leaves the EU. UK diplomats hope their EU counterparts will have a greater sense of the important role that Britain can play in Europe's security and defence community long after it has left the European Union.

"This selfie-taker risked her life on someone's shoulders at the top of a 180 metre high disused chimney in Romania The quest for extreme selfies killed 259 people between 2011 and 2017,a 2018 global study,externalhas revealed. Researchers at the US National Library of Medicine recommend that 'no selfie zones' should be introduced at dangerous spots to reduce deaths. These would include the tops of mountains, tall buildings and lakes, where many of the deaths occurred. Drowning, transport accidents and falling were found to be the most common cause of death. But death by animals, electrocution, fire and firearms also appeared frequently in reports from around the world. In July this year, 19-year-old Gavin Zimmerman fell to his death while taking selfies on a cliff in New South Wales, Australia. Allow Twitter content?

Tomer Frankfurter diedin California's Yosemite National Park in September after falling 250 metres while trying to take a selfie. News reports like this were analysed to compile the study. They found that selfie-related deaths are most common in India, Russia, the United States and Pakistan and 72.5% of those reported are men. Previous studieswere compiled from Wikipedia pages and Twitter, which researchers say did not give accurate results. The new study also showed that the number of deaths is on the rise. There were only three reports of selfie-related deaths in 2011, but that number grew to 98 in 2016 and 93 in 2017. However, the researchers claim that the actual number of selfie deaths could be much higher because they are never named as the cause of death. ""It is believed that selfie deaths are underreported and the true problem needs to be addressed,"" it says. ""Certain road accidents while posing for selfies are reported as death due to Road Traffic Accident. ""Thus, the true magnitude of the problem is underestimated. It is therefore important to assess the true burden, causes, and reasons for selfie deaths so that appropriate interventions can be made.""

"This video can not be played Pupils harness pedal power during lessons A school has introduced pedal machines under its desks in a bid to tackle the ""rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes"". Thirty machines, costing Â£20 each, have been bought using the PE budget for pupils at Red Oak Primary in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Head teacher Heather Madsen said: ""This is about setting up activity levels for the rest of their lives."" She hopes to fund more machines across the 430-pupil school, asfirst reported in the East Anglian Daily Times,external. Pupils aged seven and eight have been ""road-testing"" the machines under their desks Their use is not compulsory, but the head teacher said pupils have welcomed them. ""It was initially a novelty and like the Tour de France here, but since then they've calmed down and some are doing it out of habit,"" she said. ""We were talking about initiatives that would stimulate the children's concentration and ensure they could still stay focused on lessons."" Funding for the Â£20 machines has come from the school's physical education budget The machines, which were introduced this term, feature a display that shows duration of pedalling, number of revolutions per minute and calorie consumption - with some pupils burning up to 800 calories a day. Evie-Rose, a pupil at the school, said: ""I enjoy it because it's really fun, your brain works faster and you get stronger and smarter at the same time."" Another pupil, Ella, said: ""Sometimes we try to beat each other in class. I feel really famous because we've had lots of visitors wanting to put us on their news.""

"The firm that owns viral news website Unilad has gone into administration, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Bentley Harrington has debts of Â£6.5m, including owing Â£1.5m to UK tax authorities. The Unilad Facebook account has 39 million followers and posts viral videos and news stories. A Â£10m joint bid for the company has been made by Linton Capital, whose partner David Sefton said he had ""known the company for quite a while."" Rocket Sports, which chief executive Will Muirhead describes as ""a network of 300 biased football news creators"" on social media, is part of the joint bid. The offer of Â£10m in cash, which Mr Sefton said has been secured, would go to paying back creditors at 100p in the pound, he said. He added that Unilad was attractive as a business as it pulled in ""core programmatic revenue"" of between Â£6m and Â£7m per year. Unilad, which has offices in London and Manchester, was founded in 2010. It was shut down in 2012, but relaunched in 2014 under new owners Liam Harrington and Sam Bentley. It was named as one of Facebook's most popular pages last year. Manchester-based administrators Leonard Curtis Business Rescue and Recovery say they are ""seeking offers for the business in order to preserve jobs and maximise the return to creditors"". Mr Sefton said he was aware of other parties who were interested in bidding, but as far as he was aware, his was the first formal bid. It is understood that Unilad employs more than 200 people. Administration came after a hearing at a specialist Insolvency and Companies Court in London, where Judge Clive Jones heard that a creditor and directors of the firm agreed that administrators should be appointed. HM Revenue and Customs officials were also not against administrators being appointed. Unilad founder Alex Partridge told the court he was owed Â£5m and argued for the company to be placed into administration. Lawyers for Bentley Harrington had initially argued against administration, but withdrew their objections. HM Revenue and Customs officials have issued a petition to wind up Bentley Harrington in separate litigation, with that case coming to court on 31 October.

"Eleanor Wilson faces four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust A schoolteacher told police that claims she had sex with a teenage pupil in an aeroplane toilet made her ""feel sick"". Eleanor Wilson is accused of having sex with the boy on the way back from a school trip in 2015. She described the allegations against her as sounding ""like a porn film"" and said the claims had come from the boy's imagination, Bristol Crown Court heard. Ms Wilson, 29, denies four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust. The pupil and the school concerned cannot be identified for legal reasons. Ms Wilson said during a police interview that having sex with the teenager was ""the last thing on my mind"". ""I value my job,"" she added and said that she would not have wanted to risk her position by going to prison, the court heard. ""It just sounds like a porn film. It's come from his imagination. The other staff there would say that wasn't happening. It makes me feel sick, the idea of it."" Ms Wilson, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, admitted meeting up with the boy and texting him after the school trip, explaining ""the lines were blurred"". In police interviews, she said she later told him she was pregnant by her boyfriend Andrew Hall, and was planning to have an abortion because she ""felt lonely and upset"". Ms Wilson agreed she had told the teenager to keep their meetings a secret, but added she only saw him ""as a mate"", and did not have feelings for him. Giving evidence in court for the first time, Ms Wilson said there was ""no truth whatsoever"" in allegations she had a sexual relationship with a teenage boy, who she described as ""quite a charming, cheeky chap"". She told jurors that during the flight she was regularly checking on several students who were suffering from food poisoning. Ms Wilson, who now works as a civil servant, said her former boyfriend Mr Hall was ""very controlling"" and ""at times abusive"" and by August 2015 she was unhappy with their relationship. She told the jury she phoned the pupil after an argument she had had with Mr Hall while they were on holiday. ""I called him because I didn't have anyone else. He knew it was bad and he wouldn't judge what I said. He knew me,"" she said. The trial continues.

"In the past, Shetland has often appeared in maps floating in a box off the Aberdeenshire coast New rules barring public bodies from putting Shetland in a box on official documents have come into force. Islands MSP Tavish Scott had sought to change the law to ban the ""geographical mistake"" which ""irks"" locals, by amending the Islands (Scotland) Bill. The bill's ""mapping requirement"" has now come into force, although it does give bodies a get-out clause if they provide reasons why a box must be used. Mapmakers argue that boxes help avoid ""publishing maps which are mostly sea"". The Islands Bill, which aims to offer greater protections and powers to Scotland's island communities, was unanimously passed in May. It gives island councils extra powers over activities on and around their coastlines and requires ministers to have a long-term plan for improvement. 'Nobody puts Shetland in a box' Thanks to an amendment from Mr Scott, it also includes a ""Shetland mapping requirement"". The Lib Dem MSP said the common practice of placing Shetland in a box off the Moray Firth or the Aberdeenshire coast was ""intensely annoying"" to islanders, and created a false impression of the challenges they face on account of their remote location. Tavish Scott initially raised the issue with the rural economy committee The final rule written into the bill requires the islands to be ""displayed in a manner that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland"" in any documents published by Scottish public authorities. However, it does note that authorities can avoid complying with this if they provide ""information"" about their reasons. Mr Scott said it was ""ridiculous"" that he had to change the law to close the box. He said: ""There is no excuse now for the Scottish government, its agencies or others to put Shetland in a box. The box is closed. It doesn't exist, whether that be in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney. Shetland is now in the right place. ""This Islands Act must go a whole lot further. Islands proofing - ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation - must work."" Islands minister Paul Wheelhouse welcomed the requirement coming into force, alongside the rest of the bill. He said: ""The Scottish islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures. ""They have very distinctive needs so the act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future."" Shetland appears in a box on some banknotes Proper context - the red bordered landmass is Shetland in its rightful position with Norway to the east and Iceland to the north west Only the Scottish Conservatives spoke out against the move at Holyrood, with MSP Peter Chapman calling it ""impractical"" and warning it would reduce the amount of detail in maps due to changing scales. This was backed by the Ordnance Survey mapping agency, which said inset boxes avoid ""publishing maps which are mostly sea"". A spokesman for the company said: ""The Shetland Islands are approximately 245km (152 miles) from the Scottish mainland, from the most northerly part of the Shetland Islands to John O' Groats, and 690km (428 miles) from the most southerly point of the Scottish and English border.

"Miguel Alves was one of the first people to escape the Grenfell Tower fire One of the first people to escape the Grenfell Tower said he wished he had warned every floor about the fire. Miguel Alves and his wife Maria returned to the building from a night out at about 01:00 BST and saw the blaze starting on the 4th floor. The couple went up to their 13th floor flat to rescue their children, ignoring advice to stay put, saying it was like ""waiting in a trap"". Mr Alves said: ""It was my duty to help my neighbours, they are my family"". The fire in the early hours of 14 June 2017 claimed the lives of 72 people. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us Grenfell bereaved to decide site's future Mr Alves said after reaching his children, his daughter Ines fled the property with just her revision notes for her chemistry GCSE exam, which she was due to take the following day. The inquiry heard Ines got an A grade in the exam, which prompted the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick to say it was ""astonishing"" that she achieved such a high grade after experiencing such trauma. CCTV showed Mrs Alves getting out of a lift and leaving the building After getting his two children out of the flat, Mr Alves, who had lived in the North Kensington block for 19 years, knocked on the doors of the five other flats on the 13th floor. He said it only took about 15 minutes for the flames to spread from the bottom to the top of the tower. He added: ""The people that live on my floor are like family,  I wish I had the same strength and to go to the top floor and bring everybody down."" On Wednesday, his wife Maria said she was still haunted by guilt because she hadn't buzzed more doorbells. One of the doors Mr Alves knocked on was that of Randa Al-Arasi, who also lived on the 13th floor with her husband Mohammed Ahmed. In a written statement she said she was  ""quite happily, totally unaware"" of the scale of the fire until Mr Alves knocked on their door. ""I was not worried as there was no fire alarms sounding, no sprinklers and no indication of how dangerous the situation I was in was."" When she got to the ground floor  ""almost half of the building was on fire,"" she said. ""I could not believe that we were not warned of the enormity of this fire and to get out,"" she added. Mr Alves said the London Fire Brigade should have evacuated everyone from the tower block immediately. In his written statement he said: ""Looking at the fire on Grenfell Tower, it seemed clear that the fire brigade should have gone to the top of the tower, knocked on all the doors and got people out. ""There was still enough time to evacuate the building and it was clear the fire could not be stopped and that this was the only choice."" Mr Alves said the fire travelled up the tower within 15 minutes At about 01:30 BST Mr Alves called his friend Marcio Gomes, who lived on the 21st floor with his two daughters and wife, who was eight months pregnant. Mr Alves said: ""He did not leave and said he was waiting for the fire brigade, who had told him to stay in the flat. ""I said that there was no way for him to stay and he had to get out. I was terrified for him and his wife. ""I spoke to him in Portuguese and kept saying if he stayed there he was going to die."" Mr Gomes and his family did eventually escape and were treated in hospital. Mr Alves also told the inquiry that he took pictures of cars which obstructed the fire crews' access to the tower on the night of the blaze. He said: ""I was really frustrated about this because I had seen it there many times before and had complained to the council that this kind of parking would block fire engines."" During Thursday's inquiry, Richard Millett QC also read out the written testimony of Shahid Ahmed, who described a fireball coming through his flat window after being woken by the fire alarms. ""As soon as I got to the kitchen and looked down out of the window I saw a big fireball coming up from the outside of the building. It was the colour of a burning sunset. ""I initially thought it must have been a fire in the flat below. The kitchen window then exploded inwards. I was lucky I wasn't close to the window.""

"The two men were found dead at Banham Poultry in the early hours Two men have died after a suspected gas leak at a poultry firm in Norfolk. Police were called to Banham Poultry after reports two subcontractors had been found dead at about 01:10 BST. The men, aged in their 30s and 40 and from a pest control company, were found dead close to the factory in Station Road, Attleborough. Police have said a potential refrigeration gas leak near where the men were working was one line of inquiry. Officers said they believed there was no threat to the wider public as result of the gas leak. The fire service, police and the Health and Safety Executive remain at the scene ""in order to understand the circumstances which led to the men's deaths"", it added. A cordon is in place at the factory and at the nearby railway station, where only the Norwich-bound platform is open. Earlier, Greater Anglia said Cambridge-bound trains would not stop at Attleborough because of a ""chemical spillage"" and disruption was expected until further notice. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Footage of Zakaria's arrest was released by police after his conviction A drug dealer who trafficked teenagers to sell heroin and crack cocaine through his ""county lines"" narcotics network has been jailed for 14 years. Zakaria Mohammed, 21, groomed them before transporting them from Birmingham to rural Lincolnshire. West Midlands Police said it was the first time a drug dealer had been convicted, under the Modern Slavery Act, of trafficking children. He admitted conspiracy to supply class A drugs and trafficking charges. Police said Mohammed, from Aston in Birmingham, was ""cynical, deliberate and ruthless"" in befriending young and vulnerable children, aged 14 and 15 at the time, to use as a commodity to further his drug-dealing business. Children, who had previously been reported as missing to the force, were found inside three flats in Lincoln when police conducted raids and recovered money, drugs and weapons. ""Dishevelled"" children were found living in one flat with no food or heating At least one flat was described as ""unsanitary"", littered with drug paraphernalia, with no heating or food, despite police believing Mohammed was making as much as Â£500 a day. Latest news and updates in the West Midlands Although it is believed that as many as 10 children were involved, Mohammed was prosecuted for trafficking two boys who were found in a flat and a girl he bought a train ticket to Lincoln for. Passing sentence at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Nicholas Webb said: ""The fact is the children were being taken away for days or weeks, exposed to potential danger in a squalid environment."" Mohammed had a ""significant"" role which he was carrying out in order to pay off a drugs debt. ""Your contribution was to exploit their vulnerability,"" the judge said. Drugs were found at some flats along with weapons, police said Officers launched an investigation with Lincolnshire Police after two 15-year-old boys who were reported missing from their Birmingham homes were found in a flat in Yarborough Road, on 25 January. Subsequent surveillance identified a Seat Leon registered in Mohammed's name making regular trips from Birmingham, often with teenagers, to an address in Lincoln, police said. He was stopped in his vehicle by police in February, which led officers to finding a phone to run the drugs line, called ""Castro"", which contained more than 100 customer contacts. The car also had school uniform trousers, a white shirt and school tie inside it belonging to a missing child from Birmingham. Children were filmed distributing drugs in Lincoln Forensic tests on two soft drinks in the vehicle gave a DNA match to two other 15-year-old boys who had been reported missing from the city. With his car impounded, Mohammed was later seen taking taxis with children to Lincoln and filmed on CCTV at Birmingham's New Street station in March buying train tickets for a boy and a girl. Lincolnshire Police filmed children passing on the drugs to customers, with some transactions occurring as regularly as every 10 or 15 minutes. By Sima Kotecha, Midlands correspondent West Midlands Police is happy to publicise this case as the force believes it's been triumphant in bringing Mohammed to justice. However, charities have told BBC News this type of trafficking is going on much more than we might think and the authorities need to be ""sharper"" in finding those responsible. Children involved are vulnerable and scared and it's very unlikely that they'll go to the authorities themselves, placing more responsibility on the intelligence services and police to rescue them. This landmark case highlights how behind closed doors, even in the 21st Century, children are being exploited and treated like slaves, and even once they're found, the mental scarring of the nightmare they lived is unlikely to ever fade. The children in this case were never prosecuted for dealing drugs, instead they were seen as victims of grooming who were promised the world - and given squalor instead. Mohammed was eventually arrested while driving in Lincoln. Police said he was ""a very busy man, living the life of a travelling salesman, sleeping in service stations and out on the road for many hours each day taking drugs and phones to children"". Supt Richard Agar said: ""He befriended these children... with one end in mind and that was [to] exploit them. ""He didn't see them as individuals. He saw them as a commodity. He didn't recognise their humanity."" The phrase ""county lines"" refers to the phone line used by inner-city gangs to either set up and run, or take over drug-dealing businesses in smaller towns and cities. Mohammed previously admitted four counts of conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine and five counts of arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to exploitation.

"This video can not be played Tusk: Comparing EU with Soviet Union 'unwise and insulting' Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's jibe likening the EU to the Soviet Union was ""as unwise as it is insulting"", the president of the European Council says. Donald Tusk called for ""respect"", saying as someone who spent half his life in the Soviet bloc: ""I know what I am talking about."" Asked if Mr Hunt, who made the comments at the Tory conference, should resign, he replied: ""That's not my problem."" He also said a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU remained on the table. Hunt 'must apologise' for EU-Soviet jibe May demands respect from EU in Brexit talks Addressing Conservatives at the party conference in Birmingham, Mr Hunt accused the EU of seeking to punish the UK in order to ""keep the club together"". His speech recalled a visit to Latvia earlier this summer and the role that the UK and others played in helping it transition from Soviet rule to becoming a modern democracy and market economy. ""What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?"" he asked. ""The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving."" Please upgrade your browser He has since faced calls to apologise from several EU ambassadors. At a press briefing in Brussels, Mr Tusk - the former prime minister of Poland - said: ""In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return. ""Comparing the EU to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. ""The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours. ""The European Union is about freedom and human rights, prosperity and peace, life without fear, it is about democracy and pluralism - a continent without internal borders and walls. ""As the president of the European Council and someone who spent half his life in the Soviet bloc, I know what I am talking about."" At last month's EU summit in Salzburg, Mr Tusk rejected Theresa May's Brexit proposals and sparked anger among some Tories with an Instagram post apparently poking fun at the prime minister and suggesting she was ""cherry picking"". The day after the summit Mrs May called for ""respect"" from the EU towards the UK side. Mr Tusk - after his criticism of Mr Hunt's comments and his own call for respect to be shown -  added: ""Telling the truth, even if difficult and unpleasant, is the best way of showing respect for partners, that's how it was in Salzburg and that's also how it will work in the coming days."" He added: ""Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound attractive but they do not facilitate agreement."" The UK is due to leave the EU in March, but the two sides have not yet reached a deal on how this will work. Mr Tusk said that now the Conservative Party conference had ended, ""we should get down to business"". And in a remark that was welcomed by some Eurosceptics who want to scrap Mrs May's proposed trade plans, he said the EU remained open to a ""Canada plus plus plus"" deal - a reference to the EU's free trade deal with Canada. This would be ""much further reaching on trade, on internal security and on foreign policy co-operation"" than Canada's arrangement, he said. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""This shows clearly that No 10's claim that 'there is no alternative to Chequers' is just wrong.""

Reality Check: Red lines on the Irish border But Mrs May has said a deal like Canada's would not prevent a visible, physical border being needed in Northern Ireland - a key commitment of both sides - because of the extra checks that would be needed on goods. The EU has proposed a ""backstop"" plan to keep the border open - under which Northern Ireland would remain aligned to some EU rules. But this has been rejected by Mrs May who says the arrangement would carve up the UK and create a new border in the Irish sea. Irish PM Mr Varadkar said that it could take longer than the length of the post-Brexit transition period, due to run to 31 December 2020, to agree a final EU-UK trade deal. ""What I do know is that we need a backstop, a protocol on Ireland and N Ireland as part of a withdrawal agreement,"" he said. However, he added: ""I think we are entering a critical and decisive stage of these negotiations and there is a good opportunity to clinch a deal over the next couple of weeks."" UK ministers have suggested new proposals for a border backstop are being prepared. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said UK officials were understood to be working on plans for a ""hybrid backstop"" with light-touch regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the possibility of some kind of democratic oversight from Stormont and a temporary extension of the customs union to the whole of the UK in the event that a free trade deal has not been completed. There is no official confirmation of the plans or when the proposals will be presented to the EU, she added. The deputy leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, Nigel Dodds,told the BBChis party could not accept a ""separate hybrid model"" in which Northern Ireland is in the EU single market but out of its customs union. And asked about the prospect of ""light touch regulatory checks"" between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Mr Dodds asked why such techniques could not be used on the land frontier in Ireland.

"Eleanor Wilson faces four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust A schoolteacher told police that claims she had sex with a teenage pupil in an aeroplane toilet made her ""feel sick"". Eleanor Wilson is accused of having sex with the boy on the way back from a school trip in 2015. She described the allegations against her as sounding ""like a porn film"" and said the claims had come from the boy's imagination, Bristol Crown Court heard. Ms Wilson, 29, denies four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust. The pupil and the school concerned cannot be identified for legal reasons. Ms Wilson said during a police interview that having sex with the teenager was ""the last thing on my mind"". ""I value my job,"" she added and said that she would not have wanted to risk her position by going to prison, the court heard. ""It just sounds like a porn film. It's come from his imagination. The other staff there would say that wasn't happening. It makes me feel sick, the idea of it."" Ms Wilson, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, admitted meeting up with the boy and texting him after the school trip, explaining ""the lines were blurred"". In police interviews, she said she later told him she was pregnant by her boyfriend Andrew Hall, and was planning to have an abortion because she ""felt lonely and upset"". Ms Wilson agreed she had told the teenager to keep their meetings a secret, but added she only saw him ""as a mate"", and did not have feelings for him. Giving evidence in court for the first time, Ms Wilson said there was ""no truth whatsoever"" in allegations she had a sexual relationship with a teenage boy, who she described as ""quite a charming, cheeky chap"". She told jurors that during the flight she was regularly checking on several students who were suffering from food poisoning. Ms Wilson, who now works as a civil servant, said her former boyfriend Mr Hall was ""very controlling"" and ""at times abusive"" and by August 2015 she was unhappy with their relationship. She told the jury she phoned the pupil after an argument she had had with Mr Hall while they were on holiday. ""I called him because I didn't have anyone else. He knew it was bad and he wouldn't judge what I said. He knew me,"" she said. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Pupils harness pedal power during lessons A school has introduced pedal machines under its desks in a bid to tackle the ""rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes"". Thirty machines, costing Â£20 each, have been bought using the PE budget for pupils at Red Oak Primary in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Head teacher Heather Madsen said: ""This is about setting up activity levels for the rest of their lives."" She hopes to fund more machines across the 430-pupil school, asfirst reported in the East Anglian Daily Times,external. Pupils aged seven and eight have been ""road-testing"" the machines under their desks Their use is not compulsory, but the head teacher said pupils have welcomed them. ""It was initially a novelty and like the Tour de France here, but since then they've calmed down and some are doing it out of habit,"" she said. ""We were talking about initiatives that would stimulate the children's concentration and ensure they could still stay focused on lessons."" Funding for the Â£20 machines has come from the school's physical education budget The machines, which were introduced this term, feature a display that shows duration of pedalling, number of revolutions per minute and calorie consumption - with some pupils burning up to 800 calories a day. Evie-Rose, a pupil at the school, said: ""I enjoy it because it's really fun, your brain works faster and you get stronger and smarter at the same time.""

"Bradley Tout jumped out of the dock after being unanimously convicted of rape A rapist who leapt from the dock and ran out of court moments after being convicted is being hunted by police. Jurors at Worcester Crown Court unanimously convicted Bradley Tout, 20, of an attack on a teenage girl, in December 2016. Upon hearing the verdict, Tout ""vaulted"" from the dock and was able to evade court officers during a chase. Security firm GeoAmey confirmed the escape and said one officer had to be taken to hospital with injuries. No police officers were at court when Tout made his escape shortly after 16:00 BST on Wednesday, West Mercia Police said. Those present at the hearing told the BBC Tout could be seen with both hands on the 4ft-high dock shortly before he jumped over it Latest news and updates from the West Midlands No action was taken to apprehend him in the courtroom, they said, and a communications breakdown meant staff did not know who to stop when a panic alarm was set off. Tout was able to run out of the courtroom before passing security officers and running through a metal detector onto the street outside. During an altercation outside, the court officer suffered suspected broken ribs and bruising. According to those who were in the courtroom, Judge Nicholas Cartwright told jurors he had ""never seen anything like that happen before"". Supt Paul Moxley, of West Mercia Police, said a GeoAmey court officer ""did give chase"" to Tout but was ""unable to catch up with him"". A GeoAmey court officer was unable to catch Tout after he ran from the court At a sentencing hearing after his escape, Tout, of Durham Road, Worcester, was jailed for seven and a half years in his absence. His co-defendant, Kulin Odedra, 28, from Canterbury Road, Worcester, was jailed for 11 and a half years for three counts of rape and one count of attempted rape. The court heard the attacks happened in Tout's car after he parked behind a skip in County Hall in December 2016. Judge Cartwright said Tout was a ""manipulative liar"" who treated his victim ""like a sexual commodity"". ""He's committed a very serious offence and now he's committed more offences by escaping from lawful custody,"" said Supt Moxley. Anyone harbouring or assisting Tout ""should also expect to be arrested"", he said. Police described the 20-year-old as white, 5ft 8ins, with short mousey brown hair. He was wearing a white top and dark trousers when he escaped. Supt Moxley said he did not believe Tout to be dangerous and appealed for anyone with information to contact police immediately.

"Online retailing giant Amazon has been criticised for cutting benefits for UK warehouse workers, offsetting part of a pay rise announced this week. The removal of employee share and incentive schemes could cost some workers Â£1,500 in a single year, according to the GMB union. Amazon, it says, is imposing ""a stealth tax on its own wage increase - a clear case of robbing Peter to pay Paul"". The firmis raising pay for hundreds of thousands of staffin the US and UK. Amazon's lowest paid US workers will receive $15 an hour from 1 November. In the UK, pay will rise from Â£8.20 an hour in London to Â£10.50, while outside London the rate rises from Â£8 an hour to Â£9.50. The pay rise applies to 250,000 workers in the US, 17,000 in the UK and tens of thousands of seasonal workers. The move comes after criticism of its employment practices, with complaints over its warehouse working conditions. Amazon owner Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man Tim Roache, the GMB's general secretary, said the firm had conducted a ""PR blitz ... without mentioning a dicky bird about cutting staff benefits"". ""Meanwhile, workers still graft in horrific conditions to impossible targets and Amazon refuse to listen to or engage with a trade union,"" he said. ""If Jeff Bezos - the richest man in the world - really wants to give hardworking staff a pay rise he should let them keep their share options as well as increasing their hourly rate."" Amazon, which refuses to recognise the GMB union, confirmed the incentives were being withdrawn. On a blog post,externalit said it had made the changes because ""hourly fulfilment and customer service employees [said] they prefer the predictability and immediacy of cash [to share bonuses]"". It said it would be phasing out share bonuses, which would be replaced with a share-save scheme, allowing staff to buy discounted shares. The Bezos backlash Amazon and Starbucks blast Seattle homeless tax How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Amazon UK tax bill falls despite profits leap Amazon added that the increase in hourly cash wages would ""more than compensate"" for the phasing out of other incentives. ""We can confirm that all hourly operations and customer service employees will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement. In addition, because it's no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable."" As well as the recent criticisms, Amazon has also been attacked by campaigners for how much tax it pays.  The company is one of the world's biggest companies in the world, worth about $1 trillion. Mr Bezos, its founder, is the world's richest man, with a fortune estimated at some $150bn. Amazon's pay rise comes after widespread strikes by workers across Europe. This summer, workers took action to coincide with the internet retail giant's Prime promotion event.  Staff at warehouses in Germany Spain and Poland were trying to force the firm to offer better working conditions. Amazon is also facing pressure from workers in the US, and the pay rise coincides with a cross-US movement by retail unions to raise wages to a minimum of $15 an hour, the so-called ""Fight for Fifteen"" movement.

"A team of Russians allegedly tried to compromise and disrupt computers at the OPCW (file photo) Four Russians, a car full of electronic equipment, and a foiled plot to hack the world's foremost chemical weapons watchdog. The Dutch security services say Russia planned a cyber-attack on the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague earlier this year. At a press conference on Thursday, Defence Minister Ank Bijleveld said the plan was thwarted with the help of officials from the UK. Russia has described the allegations as a ""diabolical cocktail"" and a ""rich fantasy"". Here is what we know about the alleged plot so far. The four suspects travelled on diplomatic passports Dutch and British officials have named four Russians they say are agents in a GRU intelligence cyber warfare team. Specifically, GRU's Unit 26165, which has also been known as APT 28 and has been accused of conducting cyber operations around the world. Alexei Morenets, 41, and Yevgeny Serebriakov, 37, were described by officials as ""cyber-operators"". Oleg Sotnikov and Alexei Minin - both aged 46 - were also named as support agents. They allegedly travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports and arrived in the country on April 10. ""They were clearly not here on holiday,"" the head of the Dutch intelligence service said on Thursday. The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia What happened to the Skripals? Russia 'tried to hack Foreign Office' Yevgeny Serebriakov's laptop was ultimately seized by the authorities, and his search history showed he had researched the OPCW building and its surroundings. It also included a picture of him at the Olympic games in Brazil in 2016 alongside an unidentified Russian athlete. Yevgeny Serebriakov pictured at the Olympic Games in 2016 The OPCW has been investigating the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK. Authorities believe Mr Skripal's door in the city of Salisbury was targeted with the nerve agent Novichok. The organisation was also examining an alleged chemical attack by Syria's Russian-backed military in Douma. The OPCW is the world's top chemical weapons watchdog, and in June granted itself new powers to assign blame for attacks despite protests by Russia. At the time, Russia said the organisation was going beyond its mandate and Industry Minister Georgy Kalamonov said it was like a ""sinking ship"". After arriving in the country, the team of Russians hired a grey Citroen C3 car and were seen scouting the area around the OPCW building. Alexei Minin's recovered camera shows a number of reconnaissance photographs of the area which were taken on 11 April. All the while the group were being closely monitored by the Dutch intelligence service. They planned to carry out a closed access hack operation targeting the OPCW's wifi network, officials say. In the rear of the car they had set up specialist equipment for doing this, and parked the vehicle in the car park of a nearby Marriot hotel. The equipment included an antenna which was hidden under a waterproof jacket and aimed at the OPCW office. This was being used to intercept login details, Maj Gen Onno Eichelsheim from the Dutch MIVD intelligence service said. The goal was to compromise and disrupt computers in the building, officials say. They then planned to travel to Switzerland on 17 April, as shown by train tickets that were in their possession, but they were intercepted before they could leave. Mark Ward, technology correspondent Close or ""drive-by"" attacks on wi-fi networks are well known in the cyber-security world. They are an established technique for penetrating a target. They work well because some wi-fi hotspots can harbour hardware weaknesses that can be exploited to grab traffic. Some run third-party software that can contain vulnerabilities. There have also been instances of hotspot makers picking passcodes that are easy to generate. And researchers have demonstrated fundamental weaknesses in the protocols used to create hardened passcodes. Then there are the issues with the way wi-fi works, which make it possible to force gadgets that use wireless to hop onto fake, copycat networks. All of this would be well known to the average nation-state-backed hacker. The group were being continually monitored by the intelligence services, and were eventually intercepted by the authorities on 13 April. When this happened they tried to destroy one of the mobile phones they were carrying, which officials say shows their heightened awareness of security. They had also collected their litter from the hotel they were staying at, also allegedly for security reasons. The four men were detained and expelled to Moscow rather than being arrested. This is probably because they had diplomatic passports and, under the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats are theoretically immune from prosecution. They were escorted to Schiphol airport and put on a plane without any of their items, and the intelligence services were in charge of the operation. ""The decision taken at the time of catching the operatives was to disrupt as quickly as possible so we deported them, it was not a police operation,"" the director of the Dutch intelligence service said. As well as the specialist equipment in the car, Yevgeny Serebriakov's laptop was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia. In Malaysia it was used to target the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Earlier this year Dutch-led international investigators concluded that the missile belonged to a Russian brigade. Russia has denied any involvement in the plane's destruction. Separate data from the laptop showed it was also present in the Swiss city of Lausanne where it was linked to the hacking of a laptop belonging to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which has exposed the taking of performance-enhancing drugs by Russian athletes. Officials also found Alexei Morenets's taxi receipt, which showed he had travelled from the GRU headquarters to a Moscow airport on 10 April - the day they arrived in the Netherlands. There were also a number of print-outs from Google Maps showing Russian diplomatic buildings in Switzerland, where they had planned to travel.

"US and UK intelligence agencies claim state-sponsored Russian hackers are trying to hijack internet hardware The latest warning of Russian intrusions is another sign that cyber-space is becoming one of the focal points for growing tension between Russia and the West. But so far,much of the talk about cyber-warremains hypothetical rather than real. It is true that Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is on high alert for the possibility of some kind of Russian activity. More people and resources have been devoted to monitoring and investigation. There has also been outreach to companies to warn them on what to look out for and what to do. ""Russia is our most capable hostile adversary in cyber-space, so dealing with their attacks is a major priority for the National Cyber Security Centre and our US allies,"" NCSC chief Ciaran Martin said in a statement. Russia accused of global net hack attacks Russian Fancy Bear hackers' UK link revealed UK think tanks 'hacked by groups in China' But so far, there has not been any sign of a significant cyber-attack or change of behaviour from Russia. That is not to say that officials are not seeing any Russian activity. Quite the opposite, the reality is that they are almost always seeing Russian activity and they have done for close to 20 years. Russian espionage - the theft of information - dates back at least to the late 1990s. More recently, in the past few years, officials in the UK and US have said they have seen Russia pre-positioning in networks that are part of the critical infrastructure in a way that could be used for destructive acts of sabotage, for instance taking down parts of the electricity grid. Ukraine's energy grid has been repeatedly attacked It is possible that Russian intrusions may be increasing. But it is too early to know for sure if this is the case, since it takes time to spot this - if it is spotted at all - and to be sure it is Russian. The crucial thing is whether Russia actually employs its offensive capability to actually do something destructive. So far, there has been relatively little sign of this in the US or UK, although Russia is accused of launching destructive attacks against Ukraine, which spilled over into companies that did business there. It is worth saying that Britain and the US will be carrying out almost identical activities in Russia, pre-positioning in Russian networks to be able to respond. What no-one is quite sure of is whether this creates a deterrent a bit like mutually assured nuclear destruction in the Cold War. Or if the fact that cyber-attacks are harder to trace and at least partially deniable - unlike a nuclear missile - makes the threshold for action much lower. It was notable though that thehead of GCHQ last week made public referenceto the use of Britain's offensive cyber-capability. ""For well over a decade, starting in the conflict in Afghanistan, GCHQ has pioneered the development and use of offensive cyber-techniques,"" said Jeremy Fleming. ""And by that I mean taking action online that has direct real world impact."" In this case, Mr Fleming was talking about activities targeting the Islamic State group. ""We may look to deny service, disrupt a specific online activity, deter an individual or a group, or perhaps even destroy equipment and networks,"" he said. Talking publicly about the capability is also likely to be seen as a means of warning Russia that Britain could respond if it was targeted. One possibility is that Russia could take action primarily in the information space. It has already been accused of unleashing bots and trolls to push its narrative of the Salisbury poisoning, although such activity does not fall under the traditional definition of a cyber-attack. It has previously been alleged that a hacking group called Fancy Bears has worked with the Russian military But it could use cyber-intrusions to steal compromising data and then release this into the public domain to punish those it is opposing. This tactic was used with information stolen from sporting anti-doping bodies but also in the case of the Democratic National Committee in the US. Such activity is a reminder that cyber-space should not be seen as somehow completely separate from other fields of activity - whether information flows or traditional military activity. Particularly in the Russian doctrine of hybrid warfare, it is simply part of a continuum. But as the field that is newest, the rules in cyber-space of what constitutes war and an attack are much less clear. And that may be the danger, as miscalculation could lead to escalation.

"New car sales in the UK plunged in September, figures show, while a major carmaker has warned of the effects of a no-deal Brexit. The number of total vehicles registered was down 20.5% on the same period in 2017 at 338,834, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. Carmakers had struggled with ""a raft of upheavals"" including adjusting to stricter emissions standards, it added. Meanwhile, Nissan said a no-deal Brexit would have ""serious implications"". The Japanese firm, which employs almost 7,000 people at its Sunderland plant, urged the UK and the EU to ""work towards a balanced Brexit"". Vauxhall owner PSA warns of 'dramatic consequences' of Brexit Toyota says no-deal Brexit would affect investment The SMMT said it had been an ""exceptional"" September, following ""an unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year"". It said the impact of the sales plunge was felt across the board, with registrations by private consumers, fleets and businesses all down. Sales of petrol and diesel cars fell, but those of hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles actually rose - although only just 3.9%. Since 1 September, all cars sold in the EU have had to undergo a new test known as the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure. This has replaced all existing tests of emissions and fuel economy and has caused carmakers to struggle to cope. Honda to invest $2.8bn in GM's self-driving car unit Aston Martin shares slide on debut CitroÃ«n boss: 'Where does my handbag go?' SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model line-up, it's no surprise that we've seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. ""These are exceptional circumstances, with similar declines seen in other major European markets. The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum."" Alex Buttle, director of car-buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, said the figures would send ""shock waves"" through the motor industry. He added: ""We are now entering a crucial and unprecedented period for the car industry, as the next new number plate will be March 2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU. ""It's likely to be a rollercoaster ride for new car sales figures for the foreseeable future, but it feels like we have just plunged into a deep canyon."" The release of the figures coincided with a warning from Nissan that a no-deal Brexit would harm its business. The carmaker said that frictionless trade as part of the EU single market had enabled the growth that had seen its Sunderland plant become ""the biggest factory in the history of the UK car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU"". It added: ""Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. ""As a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the WTO will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade."" A government spokesperson said it was ""determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing. Our proposals make plans for a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on industrial goods. ""However, a responsible government should prepare for all potential outcomes, including the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement can be reached, and that is exactly what we are doing."" Other carmakers have issued similar warnings and said they are making contingency plans. Last week, Toyota UK told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt output at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, while Honda has said it is identifying components it might stockpile. Last month, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest carmaker, said if the ""wrong decisions"" were taken, it could result in the ""worst of times"" for the UK and cost the company more than Â£1.2bn a year. BMW said it was looking for car parking space on either side of the Channel and has also saidit will close its Mini plant for a month following Brexit.

"A second British woman has died from ""Brazilian butt lift"" surgery, the BBC has learned, as fresh warnings come over the risks. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps) said it was the most dangerous cosmetic procedure to undergo. The surgery has been made popular by celebrities. But many people are putting themselves at risk by seeking cheaper procedures abroad, Baaps warned. A Brazilian butt lift (BBL) is a cosmetic procedure in which fat is taken from one part of the body and then injected into the buttocks. Baaps told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme an estimated one in 3,000 die worldwide as a result of complications. In August, 29-year-old Leah Cambridge died while undergoing aBBL procedurein Turkey. A second British woman in her late 20s, also died this year, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. An inquest into her death is due to happen within the next year. Gerard Lambe, consultant plastic surgeon and Baaps member, explained: ""It has the highest death rate of all procedures due to the risk of injecting fat into large veins in the buttocks, that can travel to the heart or brain."" One 23-year-old woman from Wales - who did not wish to be named - said she had been left scarred for life after having BBL surgery in February in Turkey. Three months after the procedure, infected holes appeared on her buttocks. ""I couldn't walk properly for ages,"" she said. ""To be honest, when the holes came it was better as the fat was leaking out, which made it possible to walk again."" She said her buttocks were leaking for three months, ""soaking all my clothes"". She added: ""It smelled. I had to bandage it up every day. ""I honestly wish I could go back. I was happy with my body before. And now I paid a stupid amount of money to look like this."" Women who have undergone BBL surgery abroad have had to seek NHS treatment as a result of it going wrong, which Baaps estimates is costing the Health Service thousands of pounds. It has calculated that serious complications - including pulmonary embolus, fat necrosis and abscess - that require time in hospital can cost more than Â£13,000 per patient. Those affected require an average hospital stay of 20 days, it suggested, based on data at one hospital. Celebrities such as reality TV star Kim Kardashian are seen as being central to the trend Cheryl Palmer-Hughes, a solicitor from Irwin Mitchell specialising in claims arising from cosmetic surgery abroad, said the number of girls inquiring about BBL complications is growing. ""Some patients have had skin grafts, [others] have had significant periods of time off work and some have suffered psychological issues,"" she said. ""Complaints also include having fat transferred to the wrong area of the body - for example, to the thighs rather than the buttocks."" A second woman who spoke to the BBC anonymously said she went to Turkey for BBL surgery two years ago because ""the cost was a lot cheaper [than in the UK]"". She only met the surgeon for the first time 10 minutes before being put under general anaesthetic. A few days later she had a really high fever, but when she tried to talk to the surgeon and nurses she says they stopped responding to her emails and texts. This woman told the BBC she is still in pain two years after her BBL She was admitted to hospital in the UK, and had to take a month off work. Two years on, the woman said she still has pain from the surgery. Ms Palmer-Hughes said more than half of her clients had undergone surgery in Turkey - with Hungary, Belgium and Spain also regular destinations. She added that the women often signed documentation they do not get to read, with the terms and conditions containing a clause stating that any negative comments made online or on social media will result in a defamation lawsuit.

"Peter Wilson (R), the UK ambassador to the Netherlands, was speaking alongside Dutch defence minister Ank Bijleveld (C) after revelations by the Dutch security services Russian cyber intelligence officers tried to hack the UK's Foreign Office, a British diplomat has said. Peter Wilson, the UK ambassador in The Hague, said Russian intelligence officers tried to compromise Foreign Office systems with an attack in March. The accusation comes after Dutch security services said theyexpelled four Russians over a cyber plotagainst the global chemical weapons watchdog. Moscow said the allegations were ""not backed by any proof"". Elsewhere, the US has charged seven Russians with hacking anti-doping agencies and other organisations. The allegations are part of an organised push-back against alleged Russian cyber attacks around the world. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK was discussing further sanctions against Russia with its allies. He said Russia's ""fake news"" was in contrast to ""the hard evidence of Russian military activity"" provided by the joint operations between the Dutch and British governments. Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has written to Mr Hunt calling for an inquiry into alleged Russian interference in UK elections - in particular the EU referendum. In his letter he accused the government of ""ignoring glaring concerns"" and said there had been no response to a parliamentary committee that had asked whether the intelligence services were investigating. Russia 'targeted chemical weapons body' What we know about Russian 'OPCW plot' UK accuses Russian spies of cyber-attacks In a statement with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Theresa May said ""joint operations"" had shone ""further light on the unacceptable cyber activities of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU"". Mrs May said the attempted hack of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) demonstrated the GRU's ""disregard for the global values"". The watchdog, based in the Hague, was examining the 4 March Salisbury attack. Mr Wilson said targeting of the OPCW headquarters in May followed unsuccessful attacks by the GRU on the Foreign Office in March and on the defence laboratories at Porton Down, which was also investigating the Salisbury poisoning, in April. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Russia needed to be confronted with the evidence and that this had to be a ""diplomatic confrontation"". ""What I want is positive relations with Russia but that does mean diplomatically confronting them with the evidence both of what happened in Salisbury and of course the more recent cyber issues that come up,"" he said. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale Today's astonishing revelations show how much the UK and its allies are prepared to co-operate to maintain pressure on Russia. The British government could have sat back after it persuaded 28 countries to expel more than 150 Russian diplomats and intelligence agents in the wake of the Salisbury attack. But it went further, revealing the identities and pictures of the two Russia spies it believes were responsible for poisoning the Skripals. And now the UK and the Dutch governments have revealed a huge amount of new intelligence about how the GRU has been operating across the world. The aim of this highly unusual openness is to counter Russian behaviour by exposing their operations to the world. But for the British, there is also a wider message: namely that the UK will continue to co-operate with its European partners in the fight against Russian aggression.

"In the past, Shetland has often appeared in maps floating in a box off the Aberdeenshire coast New rules barring public bodies from putting Shetland in a box on official documents have come into force. Islands MSP Tavish Scott had sought to change the law to ban the ""geographical mistake"" which ""irks"" locals, by amending the Islands (Scotland) Bill. The bill's ""mapping requirement"" has now come into force, although it does give bodies a get-out clause if they provide reasons why a box must be used. Mapmakers argue that boxes help avoid ""publishing maps which are mostly sea"". The Islands Bill, which aims to offer greater protections and powers to Scotland's island communities, was unanimously passed in May. It gives island councils extra powers over activities on and around their coastlines and requires ministers to have a long-term plan for improvement. 'Nobody puts Shetland in a box' Thanks to an amendment from Mr Scott, it also includes a ""Shetland mapping requirement"". The Lib Dem MSP said the common practice of placing Shetland in a box off the Moray Firth or the Aberdeenshire coast was ""intensely annoying"" to islanders, and created a false impression of the challenges they face on account of their remote location. Tavish Scott initially raised the issue with the rural economy committee The final rule written into the bill requires the islands to be ""displayed in a manner that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland"" in any documents published by Scottish public authorities. However, it does note that authorities can avoid complying with this if they provide ""information"" about their reasons. Mr Scott said it was ""ridiculous"" that he had to change the law to close the box. He said: ""There is no excuse now for the Scottish government, its agencies or others to put Shetland in a box. The box is closed. It doesn't exist, whether that be in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney. Shetland is now in the right place. ""This Islands Act must go a whole lot further. Islands proofing - ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation - must work."" Islands minister Paul Wheelhouse welcomed the requirement coming into force, alongside the rest of the bill. He said: ""The Scottish islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures. ""They have very distinctive needs so the act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future."" Shetland appears in a box on some banknotes Proper context - the red bordered landmass is Shetland in its rightful position with Norway to the east and Iceland to the north west Only the Scottish Conservatives spoke out against the move at Holyrood, with MSP Peter Chapman calling it ""impractical"" and warning it would reduce the amount of detail in maps due to changing scales. This was backed by the Ordnance Survey mapping agency, which said inset boxes avoid ""publishing maps which are mostly sea"". A spokesman for the company said: ""The Shetland Islands are approximately 245km (152 miles) from the Scottish mainland, from the most northerly part of the Shetland Islands to John O' Groats, and 690km (428 miles) from the most southerly point of the Scottish and English border. ""It would be virtually impossible to print a paper map, with any usable detail, of this vast geography.""

"This selfie-taker risked her life on someone's shoulders at the top of a 180 metre high disused chimney in Romania The quest for extreme selfies killed 259 people between 2011 and 2017,a 2018 global study,externalhas revealed. Researchers at the US National Library of Medicine recommend that 'no selfie zones' should be introduced at dangerous spots to reduce deaths. These would include the tops of mountains, tall buildings and lakes, where many of the deaths occurred. Drowning, transport accidents and falling were found to be the most common cause of death. But death by animals, electrocution, fire and firearms also appeared frequently in reports from around the world. In July this year, 19-year-old Gavin Zimmerman fell to his death while taking selfies on a cliff in New South Wales, Australia. Allow Twitter content?

Tomer Frankfurter diedin California's Yosemite National Park in September after falling 250 metres while trying to take a selfie. News reports like this were analysed to compile the study. They found that selfie-related deaths are most common in India, Russia, the United States and Pakistan and 72.5% of those reported are men. Previous studieswere compiled from Wikipedia pages and Twitter, which researchers say did not give accurate results. The new study also showed that the number of deaths is on the rise. There were only three reports of selfie-related deaths in 2011, but that number grew to 98 in 2016 and 93 in 2017. However, the researchers claim that the actual number of selfie deaths could be much higher because they are never named as the cause of death. ""It is believed that selfie deaths are underreported and the true problem needs to be addressed,"" it says. ""Certain road accidents while posing for selfies are reported as death due to Road Traffic Accident. ""Thus, the true magnitude of the problem is underestimated. It is therefore important to assess the true burden, causes, and reasons for selfie deaths so that appropriate interventions can be made.""

"The divers were from Malaysia's Fire and Rescue department Six rescue divers have drowned while trying to save a teenager from a disused mining pool in Malaysia. They were searching for a 17-year-old boy who is thought to have fallen into the body of water while fishing with his friends on Wednesday. Authorities said the divers became caught in a ""whirlpool"" and sudden strong currents caused some of their equipment to come off. The search for the missing boy resumed on Thursday. The boy and his friends were about to start fishing at the mining pool in Sepang district in Selangor state when he fell in, reports said. The divers followed all safety procedures as they went into the pool on a search and rescue mission, according to Sepang district police chief Abdul Aziz Ali. They were all wearing complete diving equipment and were tied to a single rope, he said. Mr Aziz told state news agency Bernama that a strong current ""caused all victims to spin in the water"", adding that this caused their equipment to come off. ""A whirlpool had formed at the area anda team on the banks said they saw the six divers struggling to get out,external,"" Fire and Rescue Department director-general Mohammad Hamdan Wahid told the New Straits Times. The men were in the water for about 30 minutes while their colleagues tried to rescue them. All six were unconscious when they were pulled out of the water and could not be resuscitated. ""This is the first time as many as six personnel died,"" Mr Wahid told Bernama. ""This is a very sad day for us."" Mr Wahid said an initial investigation suggested that a floodwall near the area failed to contain gushing water brought about by heavy rain earlier that day, causing the strong current. Some 500 people turned out at a funeral prayer ceremony on Thursday to pay their last respects to the six victims. Their bodies were earlier today sent back to their respective hometowns. Across social media, tributes poured in for the six divers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Artwork: There's nothing like this planet-moon pair in our Solar System Astronomers have announced the possible discovery of the first known moon outside our Solar System. This ""exomoon"" is not like any in our cosmic neighbourhood: it's the size of Neptune and orbits a planet the size of Jupiter - but with 10 times the mass. The object was spotted in data from Nasa's Kepler spacecraft, and later observed using the Hubble telescope. Astronomers David Kipping and Alex Teacheyhave published their results in Science Advances journal.,external But they say that further observations are needed to understand the distant planetary system. ""We've tried our best to rule out other possibilities such as spacecraft anomalies, other planets in the system or stellar activity, but we're unable to find any other single hypothesis which can explain all of the data we have,"" said Dr Kipping, fromColumbia University in New York.,external To date, astronomers have discovered more than 3,500 exoplanets - worlds orbiting stars other than the Sun. A hunt for exomoons - bodies that orbit these distant planets - has proceeded in parallel. But so far, these natural satellites have lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques. The researchers monitored a planet known as Kepler 1625b as it passed in front of its parent star. This 19-hour event, known as a transit, blocked out some of the light coming from the star, which lies at a distance of 8,000 light-years from Earth. Artistâs impression of the exoplanet Kepler-1625b transiting the star with the candidate exomoon in tow Kipping and Teachey looked for two signals suggestive of an exomoon in the data from several transits. The first of these signals was a dip in the parent star's brightness as the exomoon passed in front. The second was a delay in the planet passing in front of its star. This is exactly what the researchers saw: ""The location, shape and depth of this event appear consistent with a Neptune-sized moon transiting in front of the star,"" said Dr Kipping. Both objects are gas giants and the apparent moon, known as Kepler 1625b-i, orbits some three million kilometres from the planet. About 3.5 hours after the planet's transit ended, the Hubble telescope recorded a second smaller dimming of the star's brightness, which indicated a moon ""trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash,"" according to Dr Kipping. In addition, the transit occurred about one-and-a-quarter hours earlier than predicted. ""That's indicative of something gravitationally tugging on the planet,"" explained Dr Kipping. The researchers also had to remove artefacts from the Hubble data and used computer models to work out how different scenarios fit with the observed data. The researchers will conduct follow-up observations with Hubble in October ""The moon model emerges as the best explanation for the data, and it has the added benefit of being a single explanation for both the timing effects and the dimming of the star that we see in the data,"" said Alex Teachey. ""Still we are urging caution here. The first exomoon is obviously an extraordinary claim and it requires extraordinary evidence."" But, he added: ""We are excited about this result, certainly it is a tantalising result."" The astronomers were allocated 40 hours of observation time on the Hubble telescope. These observations ended before a full transit of the moon could be measured. However, the evidence provides the most compelling evidence yet for the first known planetary satellite around an exoplanet. David Kipping has spent about a decade of his career searching for these distant and elusive planetary companions. Several promising exomoon candidates have cropped up in the past, only to be debunked as further data became available. Exomoons: On the hunt for mystery moons Signal may be from first 'exomoon' Dr Kipping, along with colleagues Alex Teachey and Allan Schmitt, announced that they were studying this candidate moon in July 2017. At the time, he told me it was ""the best candidate we've had"". They had already dubbed the candidate satellite a ""Nept-moon"", because of its large size. The researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one. A current theory of planetary formation suggests that objects like this are unlikely to have formed in place with their Jupiter-mass planets, but would instead be objects captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of a planetary system.

"New car sales in the UK plunged in September, figures show, while a major carmaker has warned of the effects of a no-deal Brexit. The number of total vehicles registered was down 20.5% on the same period in 2017 at 338,834, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. Carmakers had struggled with ""a raft of upheavals"" including adjusting to stricter emissions standards, it added. Meanwhile, Nissan said a no-deal Brexit would have ""serious implications"". The Japanese firm, which employs almost 7,000 people at its Sunderland plant, urged the UK and the EU to ""work towards a balanced Brexit"". Vauxhall owner PSA warns of 'dramatic consequences' of Brexit Toyota says no-deal Brexit would affect investment The SMMT said it had been an ""exceptional"" September, following ""an unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year"". It said the impact of the sales plunge was felt across the board, with registrations by private consumers, fleets and businesses all down. Sales of petrol and diesel cars fell, but those of hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles actually rose - although only just 3.9%. Since 1 September, all cars sold in the EU have had to undergo a new test known as the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure. This has replaced all existing tests of emissions and fuel economy and has caused carmakers to struggle to cope. Honda to invest $2.8bn in GM's self-driving car unit Aston Martin shares slide on debut CitroÃ«n boss: 'Where does my handbag go?' SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model line-up, it's no surprise that we've seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. ""These are exceptional circumstances, with similar declines seen in other major European markets. The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum."" Alex Buttle, director of car-buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, said the figures would send ""shock waves"" through the motor industry. He added: ""We are now entering a crucial and unprecedented period for the car industry, as the next new number plate will be March 2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU. ""It's likely to be a rollercoaster ride for new car sales figures for the foreseeable future, but it feels like we have just plunged into a deep canyon."" The release of the figures coincided with a warning from Nissan that a no-deal Brexit would harm its business. The carmaker said that frictionless trade as part of the EU single market had enabled the growth that had seen its Sunderland plant become ""the biggest factory in the history of the UK car industry, exporting more than half of its production to the EU"". It added: ""Today we are among those companies with major investments in the UK who are still waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. ""As a sudden change from those rules to the rules of the WTO will have serious implications for British industry, we urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade."" A government spokesperson said it was ""determined to ensure that the UK continues to be one of the most competitive locations in the world for automotive and other advanced manufacturing. Our proposals make plans for a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on industrial goods. ""However, a responsible government should prepare for all potential outcomes, including the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement can be reached, and that is exactly what we are doing."" Other carmakers have issued similar warnings and said they are making contingency plans. Last week, Toyota UK told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt output at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, while Honda has said it is identifying components it might stockpile. Last month, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest carmaker, said if the ""wrong decisions"" were taken, it could result in the ""worst of times"" for the UK and cost the company more than Â£1.2bn a year.

"The two men were found dead at Banham Poultry in the early hours Two men have died after a suspected gas leak at a poultry firm in Norfolk. Police were called to Banham Poultry after reports two subcontractors had been found dead at about 01:10 BST. The men, aged in their 30s and 40 and from a pest control company, were found dead close to the factory in Station Road, Attleborough. Police have said a potential refrigeration gas leak near where the men were working was one line of inquiry. Officers said they believed there was no threat to the wider public as result of the gas leak. The fire service, police and the Health and Safety Executive remain at the scene ""in order to understand the circumstances which led to the men's deaths"", it added. A cordon is in place at the factory and at the nearby railway station, where only the Norwich-bound platform is open. Earlier, Greater Anglia said Cambridge-bound trains would not stop at Attleborough because of a ""chemical spillage"" and disruption was expected until further notice. Allow Twitter content?

"US and UK intelligence agencies claim state-sponsored Russian hackers are trying to hijack internet hardware The latest warning of Russian intrusions is another sign that cyber-space is becoming one of the focal points for growing tension between Russia and the West. But so far,much of the talk about cyber-warremains hypothetical rather than real. It is true that Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is on high alert for the possibility of some kind of Russian activity. More people and resources have been devoted to monitoring and investigation. There has also been outreach to companies to warn them on what to look out for and what to do. ""Russia is our most capable hostile adversary in cyber-space, so dealing with their attacks is a major priority for the National Cyber Security Centre and our US allies,"" NCSC chief Ciaran Martin said in a statement. Russia accused of global net hack attacks Russian Fancy Bear hackers' UK link revealed UK think tanks 'hacked by groups in China' But so far, there has not been any sign of a significant cyber-attack or change of behaviour from Russia. That is not to say that officials are not seeing any Russian activity. Quite the opposite, the reality is that they are almost always seeing Russian activity and they have done for close to 20 years. Russian espionage - the theft of information - dates back at least to the late 1990s. More recently, in the past few years, officials in the UK and US have said they have seen Russia pre-positioning in networks that are part of the critical infrastructure in a way that could be used for destructive acts of sabotage, for instance taking down parts of the electricity grid. Ukraine's energy grid has been repeatedly attacked It is possible that Russian intrusions may be increasing. But it is too early to know for sure if this is the case, since it takes time to spot this - if it is spotted at all - and to be sure it is Russian. The crucial thing is whether Russia actually employs its offensive capability to actually do something destructive. So far, there has been relatively little sign of this in the US or UK, although Russia is accused of launching destructive attacks against Ukraine, which spilled over into companies that did business there. It is worth saying that Britain and the US will be carrying out almost identical activities in Russia, pre-positioning in Russian networks to be able to respond. What no-one is quite sure of is whether this creates a deterrent a bit like mutually assured nuclear destruction in the Cold War. Or if the fact that cyber-attacks are harder to trace and at least partially deniable - unlike a nuclear missile - makes the threshold for action much lower. It was notable though that thehead of GCHQ last week made public referenceto the use of Britain's offensive cyber-capability. ""For well over a decade, starting in the conflict in Afghanistan, GCHQ has pioneered the development and use of offensive cyber-techniques,"" said Jeremy Fleming. ""And by that I mean taking action online that has direct real world impact."" In this case, Mr Fleming was talking about activities targeting the Islamic State group. ""We may look to deny service, disrupt a specific online activity, deter an individual or a group, or perhaps even destroy equipment and networks,"" he said. Talking publicly about the capability is also likely to be seen as a means of warning Russia that Britain could respond if it was targeted. One possibility is that Russia could take action primarily in the information space. It has already been accused of unleashing bots and trolls to push its narrative of the Salisbury poisoning, although such activity does not fall under the traditional definition of a cyber-attack. It has previously been alleged that a hacking group called Fancy Bears has worked with the Russian military But it could use cyber-intrusions to steal compromising data and then release this into the public domain to punish those it is opposing. This tactic was used with information stolen from sporting anti-doping bodies but also in the case of the Democratic National Committee in the US. Such activity is a reminder that cyber-space should not be seen as somehow completely separate from other fields of activity - whether information flows or traditional military activity. Particularly in the Russian doctrine of hybrid warfare, it is simply part of a continuum. But as the field that is newest, the rules in cyber-space of what constitutes war and an attack are much less clear. And that may be the danger, as miscalculation could lead to escalation.

"In the past, Shetland has often appeared in maps floating in a box off the Aberdeenshire coast New rules barring public bodies from putting Shetland in a box on official documents have come into force. Islands MSP Tavish Scott had sought to change the law to ban the ""geographical mistake"" which ""irks"" locals, by amending the Islands (Scotland) Bill. The bill's ""mapping requirement"" has now come into force, although it does give bodies a get-out clause if they provide reasons why a box must be used. Mapmakers argue that boxes help avoid ""publishing maps which are mostly sea"". The Islands Bill, which aims to offer greater protections and powers to Scotland's island communities, was unanimously passed in May. It gives island councils extra powers over activities on and around their coastlines and requires ministers to have a long-term plan for improvement. 'Nobody puts Shetland in a box' Thanks to an amendment from Mr Scott, it also includes a ""Shetland mapping requirement"". The Lib Dem MSP said the common practice of placing Shetland in a box off the Moray Firth or the Aberdeenshire coast was ""intensely annoying"" to islanders, and created a false impression of the challenges they face on account of their remote location. Tavish Scott initially raised the issue with the rural economy committee The final rule written into the bill requires the islands to be ""displayed in a manner that accurately and proportionately represents their geographical location in relation to the rest of Scotland"" in any documents published by Scottish public authorities. However, it does note that authorities can avoid complying with this if they provide ""information"" about their reasons. Mr Scott said it was ""ridiculous"" that he had to change the law to close the box. He said: ""There is no excuse now for the Scottish government, its agencies or others to put Shetland in a box. The box is closed. It doesn't exist, whether that be in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney. Shetland is now in the right place. ""This Islands Act must go a whole lot further. Islands proofing - ensuring the islands are recognised in any law or government regulation - must work."" Islands minister Paul Wheelhouse welcomed the requirement coming into force, alongside the rest of the bill. He said: ""The Scottish islands have contributed and continue to contribute hugely to our culture and heritage and, with this act now starting to take force, will now have the opportunity to contribute even further to their own and our collective futures. ""They have very distinctive needs so the act introduces a number of measures to ensure there is a sustained focus across government and the wider public sector to meet the needs of island communities now and in the future."" Shetland appears in a box on some banknotes Proper context - the red bordered landmass is Shetland in its rightful position with Norway to the east and Iceland to the north west Only the Scottish Conservatives spoke out against the move at Holyrood, with MSP Peter Chapman calling it ""impractical"" and warning it would reduce the amount of detail in maps due to changing scales. This was backed by the Ordnance Survey mapping agency, which said inset boxes avoid ""publishing maps which are mostly sea"". A spokesman for the company said: ""The Shetland Islands are approximately 245km (152 miles) from the Scottish mainland, from the most northerly part of the Shetland Islands to John O' Groats, and 690km (428 miles) from the most southerly point of the Scottish and English border. ""It would be virtually impossible to print a paper map, with any usable detail, of this vast geography.""

"This video can not be played The key moments from Theresa May's speech Theresa May's claim that austerity is coming to an end is as likely as her winning Strictly Come Dancing, Labour has said. The prime minister told the Conservative Party conference that, after a decade of economic sacrifices, the end was in sight. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the words ""lacked credibility"". He said children's services faced a Â£2bn budget shortfall while councils had a Â£4bn hole in their finances. In her leader's speech in Birmingham, the prime minister said people needed to know that their ""hard work had paid off"" after a decade of budget cuts, wage freezes and below-inflation pay rises in the public sector. May: Tories must be a party for everyone PM just made Hammondâs Budget a lot trickier Why was May dancing? And did it work? She also signalled that there could be a loosening of the purse strings in next year's Spending Review, with more support for the NHS and other frontline services. ""The British people need to know... that we get it,"" she said. ""Because you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead. A decade after the financial crash people need to know that the austerity it led to is over."" But Mr McDonnell said the PM's claims ""did not hold water"", citing statistics from the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which he said indicated 75% of this year's welfare cuts had yet to happen. This video can not be played Moves like May: The prime minister's dances ""If they were serious about ending austerity, Philip Hammond would get up today and immediately cancel the cuts that are coming to hit us in the next four years,"" said Mr McDonnell. ""Councils have predicted a Â£4bn hole in their budgets next year and we have a record number of children coming into care because of the withdrawal of services from families. None of that has been cancelled. ""We are also told that an ending of austerity is completely dependent on her securing her own Brexit deal which is clearly not going to happen."" Referring to Mrs May's unexpected start to her conference speech, when she shimmied on to the stage to Abba's Dancing Queen, he said her economic arguments were about as credible as ""if she was about to win Strictly"". Mrs May's austerity pledge, as well as her announcement of an end to the borrowing cap for local councils wanting to build new homes, was welcomed by Tory MPs who want her to stake out a much bolder vision for the UK after it leaves the EU in March.

But the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed said the announcementsmade Chancellor Philip Hammond's job harder ahead of his Budget later this month. He said the chancellor was always wary of announcing the end of austerity, given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. The government has committed to finding an extra Â£20bn for the NHS by 2023 but not yet said where the money will come from, although ministers have indicated it will be partly funded by tax rises. In her speech, Mrs May scotched speculation that fuel duty could go up for the first time in nearly a decade, saying she was extending the duty freeze for a ninth year in a row, a move costing the Exchequer Â£800m.

"Children are watching more content from subscription-based online services Three out of four children under-five now has access to a tablet, smartphone or computer, according to a study. Market researcher Childwise asked more than 1,000 UK parents about their pre-schooler offspring's media habits. It said three-quarters of the children had access to a connected device and most of the three- and four-year-olds had their own tablet or PC. The BBC's Cbeebies was the children's favourite channel and YouTube the most popular app. But their tastes were becoming more diverse, Childwise added. ""The increasing use of connected devices by preschoolers this year may reflect growing access to on-demand services, especially subscription-based options such as Netflix, which has quickly risen through the ranks over the last three to four years,"" said research manager Jenny Ehren. ""Their list of favourite programmes is becoming more varied. And whilst many are drawn from across the different preschool channels, we are beginning to see more references to content exclusively available on YouTube and paid-for streaming services."" Overall, the study indicated that children were typically spending an average of two hours and 48 minutes a day - up from two hours and 36 minutes last year and two hours and 24 minutes in 2014 - watching video content in all its forms. But boys were said to watch for longer periods of time. Voice-recognition gadgets such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa were also said to be increasingly popular with the age group, with nursery rhymes and asking questions - such as: ""How big is the moon?"" - among common activities. But the children remain interested in offline activities too. And there was an increase in the number of parents reporting their children were engaged in arts and crafts and going to the library outside of school.

"Ms Mayorga alleges she was raped after meeting the footballer at a Las Vegas nightclub Kathryn Mayorga, the former teacher who has accused footballer Cristiano Ronaldo of raping her in 2009, was inspired to speak out by the #MeToo movement, her lawyer has said. ""The MeToo movement and the women who have stood up and disclosed sexual assaults has given Kathryn a lot of courage,"" Leslie Stovall said. Ronaldo has ""firmly"" denied assaulting Ms Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel. He spoke out ahead of her lawyers giving a press conference on Wednesday. The Juventus forward, 33, said he was calm over ""any and all investigations"" as he had a ""clear"" conscience over the allegation. Ms Mayorga did not attend the press conference. Her lawyer Mr Stovall said she had left Las Vegas to escape the media scrutiny. ""She has decided not to make herself available to the media and stay out of the public because of her emotional state,"" he told reporters. ""It is not pleasant for her."" In a lawsuit, Ms Mayorga says she met Ronaldo at the Rain Nightclub in the Palms Hotel and Casino, and that he raped her in his penthouse suite. Mr Stovall said his client had suffered from major depression and considered suicide since the alleged assault almost a decade ago. He said a psychiatrist had diagnosed Ms Mayorga with post-traumatic stress disorder. Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegation ""fake news"" The lawyer said that Ronaldo has 20 days to respond to Ms Mayorga's lawsuit. Her legal team are considering releasing documents linked to the case, including the initial police report and medical records. The Portuguese international had previously said the allegation, first reported in German magazine Der Spiegel, was ""fake news"".

Der Spiegel said Ms Mayorga, 34, had filed a report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. But the next year, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. Las Vegas police confirmed on Tuesdaythey had initially investigated a complaint in June 2009,but added they had no suspect in the case.

"This video can not be played Protesters take to Capitol Hill US senators are sparring over an FBI report into sexual misconduct claims against Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee. One copy of the report exists for all 100 senators to read. Democrats said it was incomplete and Republicans retorted it did not support the accusations. Judge Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all allegations against him. A confirmation vote is expected on Saturday. His appointment would tilt the court in favour of conservatives. The court's nine justices are appointed for life and have the final say on some of the most contentious issues in US public life, from abortion to gun control and voting laws. WATCH: Trump supporters brand Ford a liar The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words The truth about lie detector tests Given Republicans slender 51-49 majority in the Senate, the nominee's fate has hinged on five undecided senators - three Republicans and two Democrats. Republicans have accused Democrats of seeking to delay the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh in the hope they will make gains in the mid-term elections in November and stop his appointment altogether. As senators feuded over the report's findings, police began arresting more than 300 protesters who had gathered in a Senate office building to oppose the nominee. During a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said: ""We're just about 48 hours away from having a new person the Supreme Court."" In a statement earlier after reading the report,external, he said the FBI had ""found no hint of misconduct"". Activists have gathered in the Senate office building to protest Judge Kavanaugh's nomination The report contains summaries of interviews that the FBI has conducted. Nine people were reportedly interviewed, but not Judge Kavanaugh, 53, or the woman who first accused him of sexual assault. It is in paper format only and no copies will be made. It is being held in a secure room in the basement of the Capitol building, known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or ""Skif"". Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Simple guide to mid-term elections Senators have been told not to reveal its contents, but some have already begun to describe its findings. Senator Bob Corker said the report is 46 pages long. This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault Democrats have raised concerns the investigation has been too narrow in scope, with key witnesses not interviewed. In a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday, the lawyers for the first woman accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, criticised investigators for not speaking with more than a dozen alleged witnesses whose names she provided. Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona - like other Republicans - said the report contained ""no additional corroborating information"". Moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine said it ""appears very thorough"". Another key Republican Senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told Bloomberg she did not believe that if confirmed Judge Kavanaugh would overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalised abortion in the US. They have yet to reveal their voting intentions. A closely watched Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, said on Thursday afternoon she would vote against the nominee. ""In addition to the concerns about his past conduct,"" she said in a statement, ""last Thursday's hearing called into question Judge Kavanaugh's current temperament, honesty, and impartiality."" Another key Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has yet to declare whether he will support the nominee. If all Democrats vote against confirming Judge Kavanaugh, Republicans can only afford one defection - since in a tie, Vice-President Mike Pence would have the casting vote. Anti-Kavanaugh protesters rally outside the US Supreme Court Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Six days later, the Senate is where it was before the reopened FBI background check of Brett Kavanaugh began. The confirmation vote was, at its heart, a political decision then. It's a political decision now. The conservative president has his conservative nominee, and the conservative majority in the Senate is predisposed to put that man on the Supreme Court for life. The biggest sign that this process is heading toward a successful conclusion for Judge Kavanaugh is that, with the investigation concluded, Democrats are fighting about the process by which it was conducted. If there were some explosive revelation, it would have been blasted from the rooftops by now. Instead, key on-the-fence Republicans like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins are dropping hints they are satisfied with the results. The Senate procedural machinery is grinding toward a final weekend vote. After all the tumult of the past few days, Judge Kavanaugh could be Justice Kavanaugh by the time the Supreme Court reconvenes next week. Last week Prof Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Brett Kavanaugh had assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. She said he was drunk and had pinned her on to a bed, tried to remove her clothing and put his hand over her mouth when she screamed. Are young men in America scared? Classmate: Kavanaugh lied about drinking The women who confronted Jeff Flake Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, has accused the nominee of exposing himself to her during a drinking game when they were students at Yale University in the 1980s. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her After Prof Ford's testimony, the Senate panel approved Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, but asked for the FBI to conduct further inquiry before the full chamber voted on his appointment to America's top court. However, the FBI did not examine allegations made by a third woman, Julie Swetnick, that Judge Kavanaugh was involved in the drugging and sexual assault of girls at house parties in the 1980s. He has described that allegation as a ""joke"". The remit of the FBI investigation came from the White House, and some US media reports have said it decided not to ask the FBI to interview Prof Ford or Judge Kavanaugh. The White House Counsel's office believes thatthe sworn testimony from both in front of the Senate committee last week is sufficient,external, CNN reported.

"This video can not be played RBS boss Ross McEwan warns a ""bad Brexit"" could hit the economy and the bank RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has warned a no-deal Brexit could tip the UK economy into recession. He told the BBC a ""bad Brexit"" could result in ""zero or negative"" economic growth which would hit RBS's share price. He also said the bank was becoming careful about lending to certain sectors of the economy - particularly retail and construction. RBS is still 64% owned by the taxpayer following its bailout 10 years ago. Mr McEwan said: ""We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative and that would affect our profitability and our share price."" The news that RBS is withdrawing credit will heap further woes on the retail sector which has already seen nearly 2000 stores close so far this year. ""There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven't made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,"" said Mr McEwan. Brexit: All you need to know He also reported jitters in construction. ""The big construction companies are getting very cautious about where they are putting their capital - particularly around London."" Although its appetite for lending across the economy was unchanged overall, he said lending to large businesses was down about 2% this year as they delayed investment decisions. ""Big businesses are pausing, they are saying that in six months time I'll have another look at the UK and I might come back, but if it's really bad I'll invest elsewhere - that's the reality of where we are today."" On a brighter note, he said small and medium sized companies seemed relatively unaffected and were continuing to borrow, invest and grow their businesses. The government has repeatedly said that a ""no deal"" Brexit is not its preferred outcome and this week reinforced its commitment to securing a deal before the end of the year. However, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said the chances of failing to secure a deal are ""uncomfortably high"" and many at the Conservative Party conference were clear that leaving without a deal is better than signing up to the government's current plan. We should care what Ross McEwan says for two reasons. First, as a bank that does almost all its lending in the UK, its fortunes are dependent on those of the economy as a whole. Second, taxpayers still own two-thirds of this bank. When Ross McEwan sounds notes of caution about the future - he's talking to all of us.

"UberEats riders and a small number of workers from JD Wetherspoon, McDonald's and TGI Fridays have been staging walkouts in a pay dispute. Protests were being held in several UK cities, along with a rally in London. The industrial action was organised in tandem with strikes by fast-food workers on four continents. UberEats, JD Wetherspoon, TGI Friday's and McDonald's have all defended their record on pay. The rally in London's Leicester Square was addressed by TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Mr McDonnell said: ""Our message to exploitative employers is that we are coming for you."" Separately, about 50 UberEats couriers, Uber drivers and supporters temporarily occupied the lobby of Uber's London headquarters, in a protest supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). UberEats workers want to be paid Â£5 per delivery and a further Â£1 per mile for each delivery. These latest strikes follow a series of walkouts by UberEats drivers last month sparked by the company reducing its minimum payment per delivery from Â£4.26 to Â£3.50. Why staff at McDonald's, TGIs and Wetherspoons are striking UberEats defended its pay scheme, arguing that the majority of its couriers used delivery work to supplement existing incomes. ""Last week couriers using our app in cities across the UK took home an average of Â£9-10 per hour during mealtimes, with many also using other delivery apps,"" the firm said in a statement. Uber's London headquarters was briefly invaded ""The fact that UberEats drivers have decided to strike on the same day as us shows that low pay is an issue that affects people across the industry,"" said a spokesman from the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU). Workers at JD Wetherspoon, McDonald's and TGI Fridays want to be paid Â£10 an hour. McDonald's denied support for the union among its staff was increasing. ""All restaurants remain open as usual today despite frustrating attempts by protestors at a handful of locations to [have an] impact [on] our customers, and our restaurant teams,"" a spokeswoman said. JD Wetherspoon has previously said it had announced pay rises worth Â£20m last year and Â£27m for this year. TGI Fridays said all its team members were paid at or above the national minimum wage hourly rate, while pay rates were regularly reviewed. It added that its workers were also allowed to keep all tips they received. About 40 people gathered in Glasgowâs George Square to call for fair pay Ms O'Grady of the TUC told the BBC's Today programme that the strike was ""small but growing"". She said some modern hospitality employers and technology firms were ""using a very old form of exploitation"": ""We need the public and communities to support us. We are seeing growing public concern."" The companies in question could ""and should"" afford to award a pay rise, Ms O'Grady added. Strikes by UberEats drivers are taking place in London, Bristol, Brighton, Newcastle, Plymouth, Southampton, Glasgow and Cardiff, according to the IWW union. Workers at two Wetherspoon pubs in Brighton were expected to strike, the BFAWU said. Protesters demonstrated outside a McDonald's restaurant in south London They were being joined by workers from McDonald's outlets in London, Cambridge and Watford, and TGI Fridays staff in Milton Keynes and two London branches. The strikes are being held to coincide with industrial action over pay by fast-food workers in Chile, Colombia, the US, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Philippines and Japan.

"The United Airlines plane (not pictured) landed safely in Sydney A United Airlines flight has landed safely at Sydney Airport after issuing a mayday call due to low fuel reserves, authorities have said. Flight UA839, carrying 194 people, had been on a 15-hour flight to the city from Los Angeles. Police said they activated a ""full emergency response"" shortly before the jet landed at 06:36 local time on Thursday (20:36 Wednesday GMT). United Airlines called it a mechanical issue and said all on board were safe. ""The aircraft taxied to the gate and all customers disembarked normally,"" the airline said in a statement. The pilot of the 787-900 Dreamliner had earlier issued a mayday call due to low fuel levels, said Airservices Australia, the nation's aviation navigation authority. New South Wales police said the incident forced the brief closure of Australia's busiest airport and surrounding roads. According to Civil Aviation Safety Australia, ""fuel mayday"" calls are an automatic requirement when planes tap into reserve supplies of fuel. Strong headwinds, weather conditions and changes in route and altitude are all factors that could eat into fuel levels, said spokesman Peter Gibson. The plane would have had at least 45 minutes of flying time in its reserves, he said.

"This video can not be played The key moments from Theresa May's speech Theresa May has told the Conservatives they must be the ""party for everyone"" and said austerity was ending in her party conference speech in Birmingham. The prime minister said that a decade on from the financial crash, ""there are better days ahead"", signalling an increase in public spending. She also defended her under-fire Brexit strategy, saying she was ""standing up for Britain"". And she announced new borrowing powers for councils to build more homes. A cap on the amount councils can borrow to fund new developments ""doesn't make sense"" and would be scrapped, she said. Recap: How May's speech unfolded Freeze on fuel duty to continue, says May Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? May's warm-up act wows the Tories Reality Check: What are the plans to boost council homes? Other promises included a ""step change"" in how cancer is diagnosed with a strategy aimed at increasing early detection rates, plus another freeze in fuel duty. The prime minister - whose dancing in Kenya made headlines in August - danced on to the stage to the sounds of Abba, and immediately sought to make light of last year's difficult speech. She joked that if she had a cough this time, it was only because she had been up all night gluing the letters on to the backdrop. This video can not be played Theresa May opened her conference speech to the music of Abba's Dancing Queen The Tory conference has been dominated by Brexit, with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launching a fresh broadside against her Chequers plan - it is known by the country residence where it was agreed in July - for trade with the EU. And as she prepared to deliver the speech, Conservative MP James Duddridge announced he had submitted a letter to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for a leadership contest. In her speech there was no mention of ""Chequers"" specifically - with Mrs May describing her plan as a ""free trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods"". Defending it, she warned delegates that pursuing ""our own visions of the perfect Brexit"" could lead to ""no Brexit at all"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""A second referendum would be a politiciansâ voteâ On austerity, Mrs May said people needed to know ""that the end is in sight"". The Tories could not just ""clean up a mess"" they should ""steer a course to a better future"", she said. ""Sound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition. Because you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead."" At next year's Spending Review she said ""debt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up"". ""Because, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off."" In her speech, Mrs May said the Tories must be ""a party not for the few, not even for the many but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best"". ""Our best days lie ahead of us"", she said, adding: ""Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes."" Why was May dancing? And did it work? Johnson calls May's Brexit plan a 'cheat' Kuenssberg: Why ministers can't ignore Johnson She also condemned the personal abuse of politicians, speaking up for Labour's Diane Abbott and calling for an end to ""the bitterness and bile which is poisoning our politics"".

She said she wanted to help people on low incomes, ruling out any increase in fuel duty in the Budget on 29 October. Theresa May's performance With the complexities of Brexit, the divisions in her party, the calamity of last year's conference speech, the antics of the former foreign secretary, and of course, her own fragilities, Theresa May has struggled to find her voice - and that's got nothing to do with running out of Strepsils. Well today she found it, and in the words of one of her cabinet colleagues, not a particularly close ally, said ""she found her mojo"". From the moment she danced on to the stage (who would have thought we'd ever see that), she looked comfortable in her own skin, actually happy to be there. It sounds strange, but it is so rare to see her overtly enjoying her job. On so many occasions the public has seen a politician who seems constricted, conflicted, and ill-at-ease. For voters, frankly, if she doesn't look like she is enjoying being prime minister, why should any of us be happy about the fact she's doing it.Read Laura's full blog. The 'end of austerity' Philip Hammond is always wary of announcing the ""end of austerity"", given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. People are still feeling the pain. He is keener to emphasise that the effort expended bringing the public finances back towards balance - where the government raises in revenues the same at it spends on services - will not be put at risk with some form of ""spending splurge"". The PM just made that task harder.Read Kamal's full blog. The housing proposal Lifting the cap on how much English local authorities can borrow to build traditional council houses could have a significant impact on the supply of homes for social rent. Currently, town halls have a housing debt of about Â£26bn, the value of their existing stock acting as collateral.  Doing away with the cap would conservatively allow an extra Â£10-15bn of borrowing.  This money could be used to build an extra 15-20,000 new council homes a year over ten years. Given that the latest annual figure for completed social rent homes is less than 6,000, this might well quadruple supply in the medium term. Even that increase would not get close to meeting demand for social housing, however. The extra borrowing will count against the government's balance sheet and may well mean some tough decisions on cuts to budgets elsewhere, although there are arguments that the money could be seen as an investment rather than a subsidy because the new housing would provide a reliable income stream. Since 2012, council housing in England has realised a net rental surplus. The extra borrowing would be ring-fenced for housing but it is unclear whether all of the new stock would be for social rent.  Some shared-ownership homes might be included, for example. Although the extra borrowing freedom could come into force after early as next year, with planning and land acquisition to be sorted out, it is unlikely the boost to social housing supply will come to pass for some years. The NHS plan The pledge to create a new cancer strategy is not surprising - it was already one of the priority areas for the 10-year plan NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been asked to draw up in return for the Â£20bn funding rise the health service has been promised by 2023. Her high profile promise was to increase early detection - defined as at stages one and two - from 50% to 75% by 2028. Progress is already being made towards this. The existing cancer strategy has already made that a priority and in the last four years there has been an 11% improvement, meaning the NHS is already well on course to achieve this target. Beyond that, there were few details on what it would mean for services so it looks like we will have to wait until the 10-year NHS plan is published, expected to be November, before we know more. In response, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mrs May's claim on austerity was a ""con"" unless the chancellor takes immediate action. He said: ""If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled."" The SNP's Ian Blackford said Mrs May had ""danced around the key issues - the disastrous impact of Tory austerity and a Tory hard Brexit"". ""There is a massive gulf between her rhetoric and the reality of what is now facing the UK,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her."" The Local Government Association, which has been calling for an end to the cap on borrowing for house-building, welcomed the council spending announcement. ""Many of the projects that are already under way could quickly be scaled up,"" Conservative councillor David Simmonds, the body's deputy chairman, said. ""Councils have been asking for this for a long time and clearly the announcement today is something that means we can get on with the job."" The CBI - which criticised Mrs May's immigration plans on Tuesday - welcomed her call to ""back business"" and urged MPs to support her Brexit plan to get a deal ""over the line"".

"The UK government has accused Russia's military intelligence service of being behind four high-profile cyber-attacks. The National Cyber Security Centre says targets included firms in Russia and Ukraine; the US Democratic Party; and a small TV network in the UK. A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman described the accusation as a ""rich fantasy of our colleagues from Britain"". World Anti-Doping Agency computers are also said to have been attacked. Files later emergedshowing how British cyclists Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome had used banned substances for legitimate medical reasons. At the time, some of the attacks were linked to Russia - but this is the first time the UK has singled out the GRU, the Russian military intelligence service. British police think the men who carried out the Salisbury poisoning in March worked for the same group. The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia Russia accused of net hack attacks Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Speaking on behalf of the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova said the UK's accusations were ""mixed in one perfume bottle"", adding: ""Maybe a Nina Ricci bottle: GRU, WADA, Kremlin hackers - it's a diabolical perfume."" But Defence Minister Gavin Williamson condemned Russia as a ""pariah state"", and said Moscow's ""reckless and indiscriminate"" attacks had left it isolated in the international community. The NCSC said it has assessed ""with high confidence"" that the GRU was ""almost certainly responsible"" for the cyber-attacks. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the GRU had waged a campaign of ""indiscriminate and reckless"" cyber strikes that served ""no legitimate national security interest"". Cyber security consultant Andrew Tsonchev said individuals can get ""caught up"" in the attacks. He said: ""The more obvious and urgent effect that people need to be aware of is that the services they use - the essential services - are at risk and are actively being targeted for sabotage."" The NCSC says hackers from the GRU, operating under a dozen different names - including Fancy Bear - targeted: The systems database of the Montreal-based World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), usingphishingto gain passwords. Athletes' data was later published The Democratic National Committee in 2016, when emails and chats were obtained and subsequently published online. The US authorities have already linked this to Russia Ukraine's Kyiv metro and Odessa airport, Russia's central bank, and two privately-owned Russian media outlets - Fontanka.ru and news agency Interfax - in October 2017. They used ransomware to encrypt the contents of a computer and demand payment An unnamed small UK-based TV station between July and August 2015, when multiple email accounts were accessed and content stolen This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? Former UK diplomat Lord Ricketts said it was likely the Russians targeted Wada ""to distract from the very serious allegations about Russian athletes"", and targeted the Ukraine as they were trying to ""destabilise"" the region. But he added other attacks seemed random and might have been part of a ""pilot project"" to ""see what they can do at a point where they wanted to use"" cyber warfare. ""The GRU's actions are reckless and indiscriminate: they try to undermine and interfere in elections in other countries; they are even prepared to damage Russian companies and Russian citizens,"" said Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ""This pattern of behaviour demonstrates their desire to operate without regard to international law or established norms and to do so with a feeling of impunity and without consequences. ""Our message is clear: together with our allies, we will expose and respond to the GRU's attempts to undermine international stability."" Lord Ricketts believes rather than the UK participating in an offensive cyber counterattack, the government should continue targeting ""dodgy Russian money"" with economic sanctions. By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent Today's statement is part of a drive by Britain to keep the pressure on the Russian state and specifically on Russia's military intelligence outfit - the GRU. Some of these cyber-attacks had been previously attributed by private sector researchers to Russia. Britain had also attributed other cyber-attacks to Russia. But for the first time British intelligence has singled out the GRU - and not just the Russian state - as specifically responsible for a series of events which hit a wide range of targets. The statement also collates the range of names that have been publicly linked to the GRU by different security researchers. Some are well known, like Fancy Bear, and others less well known. The British statement puts them all together in one place and confirms that in the view of British intelligence they all belong to the GRU. Russia is not the only state to have been accused of cyber-attacks. TheUK blamed the Wannacry ransomware incident on North Korean actorsin December 2017, as did the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Denmark and Japan In March this year, Britain blamed a campaign targeting universities around the world, including in the UK, on the Mabna Institute based in Iran China-based groups linked to the statewere accused of hacking UK think tanks last year by a US cyber-security company which investigated In April, the UKsaid it had conducted a ""major offensive cyber-campaign"" against the Islamic State group. This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? The GRU, also known as the Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military. It is different from the former KGB (now known as the SVR and FSB), as it conducts undercover military and intelligence operations around the globe. In recent years the GRU has been accused of undercover involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, which saw the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. It is believed that the two men accused of poisoning Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, named asAlexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were GRU agents.

"This video can not be played The key moments from Theresa May's speech Theresa May's claim that austerity is coming to an end is as likely as her winning Strictly Come Dancing, Labour has said. The prime minister told the Conservative Party conference that, after a decade of economic sacrifices, the end was in sight. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the words ""lacked credibility"". He said children's services faced a Â£2bn budget shortfall while councils had a Â£4bn hole in their finances. In her leader's speech in Birmingham, the prime minister said people needed to know that their ""hard work had paid off"" after a decade of budget cuts, wage freezes and below-inflation pay rises in the public sector. May: Tories must be a party for everyone PM just made Hammondâs Budget a lot trickier Why was May dancing? And did it work? She also signalled that there could be a loosening of the purse strings in next year's Spending Review, with more support for the NHS and other frontline services. ""The British people need to know... that we get it,"" she said. ""Because you made sacrifices, there are better days ahead. A decade after the financial crash people need to know that the austerity it led to is over."" But Mr McDonnell said the PM's claims ""did not hold water"", citing statistics from the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which he said indicated 75% of this year's welfare cuts had yet to happen. This video can not be played Moves like May: The prime minister's dances ""If they were serious about ending austerity, Philip Hammond would get up today and immediately cancel the cuts that are coming to hit us in the next four years,"" said Mr McDonnell. ""Councils have predicted a Â£4bn hole in their budgets next year and we have a record number of children coming into care because of the withdrawal of services from families. None of that has been cancelled. ""We are also told that an ending of austerity is completely dependent on her securing her own Brexit deal which is clearly not going to happen."" Referring to Mrs May's unexpected start to her conference speech, when she shimmied on to the stage to Abba's Dancing Queen, he said her economic arguments were about as credible as ""if she was about to win Strictly"". Mrs May's austerity pledge, as well as her announcement of an end to the borrowing cap for local councils wanting to build new homes, was welcomed by Tory MPs who want her to stake out a much bolder vision for the UK after it leaves the EU in March.

But the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed said the announcementsmade Chancellor Philip Hammond's job harder ahead of his Budget later this month. He said the chancellor was always wary of announcing the end of austerity, given the fragility of economic growth and the fact that many cuts, such as to benefits, have yet to work through the system. The government has committed to finding an extra Â£20bn for the NHS by 2023 but not yet said where the money will come from, although ministers have indicated it will be partly funded by tax rises. In her speech, Mrs May scotched speculation that fuel duty could go up for the first time in nearly a decade, saying she was extending the duty freeze for a ninth year in a row, a move costing the Exchequer Â£800m.

"The United Airlines plane (not pictured) landed safely in Sydney A United Airlines flight has landed safely at Sydney Airport after issuing a mayday call due to low fuel reserves, authorities have said. Flight UA839, carrying 194 people, had been on a 15-hour flight to the city from Los Angeles. Police said they activated a ""full emergency response"" shortly before the jet landed at 06:36 local time on Thursday (20:36 Wednesday GMT). United Airlines called it a mechanical issue and said all on board were safe. ""The aircraft taxied to the gate and all customers disembarked normally,"" the airline said in a statement. The pilot of the 787-900 Dreamliner had earlier issued a mayday call due to low fuel levels, said Airservices Australia, the nation's aviation navigation authority. New South Wales police said the incident forced the brief closure of Australia's busiest airport and surrounding roads. According to Civil Aviation Safety Australia, ""fuel mayday"" calls are an automatic requirement when planes tap into reserve supplies of fuel. Strong headwinds, weather conditions and changes in route and altitude are all factors that could eat into fuel levels, said spokesman Peter Gibson. The plane would have had at least 45 minutes of flying time in its reserves, he said.

"PC Keith Palmer with his mother, Sylvia, and sisters Michelle (l) and Angela (r) The widow of the police officer killed during the Westminster attack says her husband was left ""in a vulnerable location, with no protection, to die"". It comes after the coroner said Keith Palmer's death on 22 March last year could ""possibly"" have been prevented if armed officers had been nearby. ""Shortcomings in the security system"" meant they were unaware they should have been on guard near his position. All five victims of the terror attack were ""unlawfully killed"", he ruled. They were PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31. Their killer, Khalid Masood, was shot dead by police just inside the entrance to the Palace of Westminster. The inquest into his death will take place next. Chief Coroner Mark Lucraft QC, at the Old Bailey, has carried out the month-long inquests of those who died. Giving his ruling on Wednesday, he praised the ""great dignity"" of their families throughout the process and also the ""quite overwhelming"" response from medics and members of the public. He said that on on 22 March 2017, Masood had driven a hired SUV at an average speed of 30 to 42mph with ""clear murderous intent"", killing four pedestrians and seriously injuring 29 others, before attacking PC Palmer. Could Khalid Masood have been stopped? The victims of the Westminster terror attack 'My wife didn't need to die' The issues raised at the Westminster Attack inquests The coroner highlighted the actions of one victim, Mr Cochran, who he said had ""pushed his wife away from the path of Masood's vehicle"" - ""an instinctive act"" which ""almost certainly had the effect"" of saving her life. This video can not be played Melissa Cochran was saved by her husband in the Westminster attack As part of the inquest, the coroner has also been examining security issues, including armed policing at Parliament, security on the bridge and what security service MI5 knew about Masood prior to his attack. He said PC Palmer had been ""fulfilling his job to protect the Palace and those within it"" and ""did not shrink from"" performing that duty. He was wearing a protective vest but was not armed, and the coroner said that had armed officers been stationed alongside him, they may have been able to prevent him suffering fatal injuries. PC Palmer's widow, Michelle Palmer, said in a statement that the authorities let her husband down by failing to protect him and let the family down by failing to investigate his death properly. She said: ""How could Keith have been left alone, unarmed, guarding an open gate at one of the most iconic buildings in the world and one of the country's top terrorist targets?"" She added: ""What makes it even worse is that this lax security had been carrying on for years and it has taken what happened to Keith for things to change."" The parents and sisters of PC Palmer, who would have turned 50 on Wednesday, said the inquest had been ""traumatic"" and ""extremely difficult"". They said the coroner should have gone further in his findings, accusing senior Met officers of closing ranks. This video can not be played John Frade: ""No-one should have to go through this horrendous pain"" Neil Basu, head of counter-terror policing at Scotland Yard, said the Met accepted the coroner's conclusions ""unreservedly"". He said: ""Even the possibility that the Met lost the chance to prevent the murder of such a brave and courageous officer is unacceptable. For the loss of that possibilityâ¦ we are deeply sorry."" Security arrangements had been ""substantially changed"" since that day, he added, and further changes would be made if recommended by the coroner. The attack lasted82 seconds. 14:40:08- Masood's car mounts pavement on Westminster Bridge and hits pedestrians 14:40:18- It hits another group of pedestrians and the impact sends Andreea Cristea  over the side and into the river 14:40:38- Masood crashes into perimeter fence of Palace of Westminster 14:40:59- First 999 call made to Met police 14:41:30- Masood leaves vehicle, stabbed PC Palmer, and is shot dead Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives PC Keith Palmerhad a young daughter.

Leslie Rhodesa retired window cleaner from Clapham, south London, had been visiting St Thomas' Hospital when he was hit by the car driven by Masood.

"UberEats riders and a small number of workers from JD Wetherspoon, McDonald's and TGI Fridays have been staging walkouts in a pay dispute. Protests were being held in several UK cities, along with a rally in London. The industrial action was organised in tandem with strikes by fast-food workers on four continents. UberEats, JD Wetherspoon, TGI Friday's and McDonald's have all defended their record on pay. The rally in London's Leicester Square was addressed by TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Mr McDonnell said: ""Our message to exploitative employers is that we are coming for you."" Separately, about 50 UberEats couriers, Uber drivers and supporters temporarily occupied the lobby of Uber's London headquarters, in a protest supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). UberEats workers want to be paid Â£5 per delivery and a further Â£1 per mile for each delivery. These latest strikes follow a series of walkouts by UberEats drivers last month sparked by the company reducing its minimum payment per delivery from Â£4.26 to Â£3.50. Why staff at McDonald's, TGIs and Wetherspoons are striking UberEats defended its pay scheme, arguing that the majority of its couriers used delivery work to supplement existing incomes. ""Last week couriers using our app in cities across the UK took home an average of Â£9-10 per hour during mealtimes, with many also using other delivery apps,"" the firm said in a statement. Uber's London headquarters was briefly invaded ""The fact that UberEats drivers have decided to strike on the same day as us shows that low pay is an issue that affects people across the industry,"" said a spokesman from the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU). Workers at JD Wetherspoon, McDonald's and TGI Fridays want to be paid Â£10 an hour. McDonald's denied support for the union among its staff was increasing. ""All restaurants remain open as usual today despite frustrating attempts by protestors at a handful of locations to [have an] impact [on] our customers, and our restaurant teams,"" a spokeswoman said. JD Wetherspoon has previously said it had announced pay rises worth Â£20m last year and Â£27m for this year. TGI Fridays said all its team members were paid at or above the national minimum wage hourly rate, while pay rates were regularly reviewed. It added that its workers were also allowed to keep all tips they received. About 40 people gathered in Glasgowâs George Square to call for fair pay Ms O'Grady of the TUC told the BBC's Today programme that the strike was ""small but growing"". She said some modern hospitality employers and technology firms were ""using a very old form of exploitation"": ""We need the public and communities to support us. We are seeing growing public concern."" The companies in question could ""and should"" afford to award a pay rise, Ms O'Grady added. Strikes by UberEats drivers are taking place in London, Bristol, Brighton, Newcastle, Plymouth, Southampton, Glasgow and Cardiff, according to the IWW union. Workers at two Wetherspoon pubs in Brighton were expected to strike, the BFAWU said. Protesters demonstrated outside a McDonald's restaurant in south London They were being joined by workers from McDonald's outlets in London, Cambridge and Watford, and TGI Fridays staff in Milton Keynes and two London branches. The strikes are being held to coincide with industrial action over pay by fast-food workers in Chile, Colombia, the US, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Philippines and Japan.

"President Putin has maintained the suspects in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal are civilians Russian President Vladimir Putin has labelled poisoned ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal a ""traitor"" and a ""scumbag"". In a speech, he complained that the media were treating Mr Skripal as ""some kind of human rights defender"", insisting he had betrayed his country. Mr Skripal and his daughter survived an attack in Salisbury, which the UK says was carried out by two agents of Russian military intelligence. But a British woman died in another poisoning that police say was linked. UK authorities believe Mr Skripal's door in the southern English city was targeted with the nerve agent Novichok. It was sprayed from a modified perfume bottle that was later picked up and given to Dawn Sturgess, who died in July, they say. Russian woman 'identifies' Salisbury suspect Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Last month, President Putin insisted that the suspects named by UK police were civilians not criminals, and urged them to come forward. They later gave a televised interview. He said on Wednesday that he thought the whole ""information campaign"" surrounding the former Russian spy had been ""blown up"" and that it would pass, ""the sooner, the better"". Mr Skripal is a former Russian intelligence officer, who was arrested in 2004 and put on trial for ""high treason in the form of espionage"" by a Moscow military court. Authorities accused him of being a double-agent who shared Russian state secrets with Britain's MI6. Mr Skripal has lived in the UK since being released in a prisoner swap He confessed and co-operated at trial and was then jailed for 13 years, but was pardoned in 2010 then released to the UK as part of a prisoner exchange. The former spy at centre of poison mystery Who is Sergei Skripal? ""I see that some of our colleagues are pushing the theory that Mr Skripal was almost some kind of human rights activist,"" Mr Putin said on Wednesday. The Russian leader, a former intelligence officer himself, then described Mr Skripal as a ""traitor to the motherland"". ""He's simply a scumbag, that's all."" By Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent The verbal attack on Sergei Skripal underlines Vladimir Putin's personal hatred of betrayal. He's said before it's the one thing he can't forgive. Many Russians share that contempt, and there was applause from some in the conference hall for the comments. But Mr Putin's outburst also seems meant to distract from increasing talk about the two key suspects in the poisoning. Last month, at another conference, he was asked about the men. He vouched for them personally, saying there was ""nothing special"" and ""nothing criminal"" about them. Crucially, he also insisted they were civilians. Since then, credible evidence has emerged that the men are in fact military intelligence officers and investigative journalists are still digging. On that, Vladimir Putin has so far remained silent. The UK says two Russian nationals who travelled under the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov tried to kill the ex-spy and his daughter Yulia. The two suspects gave a televised interview in Russia in which they claimed to be ""just tourists"" visiting the city of Salisbury because of their interest in its 123m (400ft) spire. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far However, their story was widely mocked in Russia as well as the UK,  and one of the men was subsequently identified by an investigative website as Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, an officer in Russia's GRU military intelligence. The Bellingcat website released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) The website, Bellingcat, said Col Chepiga had been made ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" by President Putin himself in 2014. Speaking to the BBC,a woman in the town where Chepiga grew up then then identified the Salisbury suspectas the intelligence officer. On Wednesday Mr Putin dismissed the allegation that Russia was responsible for Ms Sturgess's death. ""Sometimes I'm amazed by what's going on around this case: so some guys came to Great Britain and started poisoning homeless people? What nonsense!"" he said. BBC Monitoring About a fortnight after the poisoning, President Putin said any suggestions of Russian involvement were ""total nonsense"", and called it ""unthinkable that anyone in Russia would do such a thing ahead of the presidential election and the Fifa World Cup"". In May, Mr Putin denied that Mr Skripal was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, saying he would have died ""on the scene"" if that was the case. ""A military toxic agent is so powerful that it kills a person instantaneously,"" the president added. He went on to deny that Russia had any chemical agents: ""We have destroyed all our chemical weapons."" After Sergei Skripal was discharged from hospital later in May, Mr Putin sounded delighted. ""God bless his health, we're very glad about this,"" the president told a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""Thank God he's recoveredâ¦ and I hope he'll be healthy.""

"This video can not be played RBS boss Ross McEwan warns a ""bad Brexit"" could hit the economy and the bank RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has warned a no-deal Brexit could tip the UK economy into recession. He told the BBC a ""bad Brexit"" could result in ""zero or negative"" economic growth which would hit RBS's share price. He also said the bank was becoming careful about lending to certain sectors of the economy - particularly retail and construction. RBS is still 64% owned by the taxpayer following its bailout 10 years ago. Mr McEwan said: ""We are assuming 1-1.5% growth for next year but if we get a bad Brexit then that could be zero or negative and that would affect our profitability and our share price."" The news that RBS is withdrawing credit will heap further woes on the retail sector which has already seen nearly 2000 stores close so far this year. ""There are some retailers we are having to be a bit more cautious about because they haven't made the necessary transition from bricks and mortar to digital,"" said Mr McEwan.
