"Theresa May has made David Davis's job more difficult by setting ""red lines"" for him in Brexit talks, his ex-chief of staff has told the BBC. James Chapman said the Brexit secretary had been ""hamstrung"" by the prime minister's stance on the European Court of Justice (ECJ), among other things. He said Mrs May would not get a Brexit deal through Parliament unless she showed more ""flexibility"". Downing Street and the Department for Exiting the EU declined to comment. Mrs May has insisted the ECJ will have no jurisdiction over the UK. But the EU insists that the ECJ must continue to offer legal protection for its citizens in the UK, just as it does now. Brexit 'as complicated as moon landing' Britain and EU at odds over citizens' rights The ECJ's main role is to uphold the rules of the single market, rather than rule on criminal matters like the European Court of Human Rights. Mr Davis has said a new international body will have to be set up to settle disputes between the UK and the EU after Brexit, a job currently done by the ECJ. Mr Chapman accused Mrs May of taking an ""absolutist"" position on the ECJ, saying: ""She's set a red line effectively for a conference speech that hamstrung these negotiations in my view."" He added: ""There have been red lines that have been set for him that make the job he has to do very difficult."" Mr Chapman also warned, in an interview withThe Week in Westminsterto be broadcast on Saturday at 11:00 BST on BBC Radio 4, that Mrs May would struggle to get her version of Brexit past MPs. ""If she doesn't, in my point of view, show more flexibility, show more pragmatism than she did demonstrate in the Home Office, she won't get this stuff through Parliament."" A former Daily Mail journalist, Mr Chapman was George Osborne's director of communications before becoming Mr Davis's chief of staff at the new department for exiting the EU. Theresa May and Spain's PM Mariano Rajoy at a G20 summit He also revealed that cabinet ministers wanted Mrs May to do a U-turn over plans to pull the UK out of Euratom, the pan-European atomic energy regulator. Euratom is a separate legal entity from the EU and gives Britain's nuclear industry access to technology and fissile material. Mr Chapman said the reason for wanting to withdraw from Euratom was to prevent the free movement of nuclear scientists, which is governed by the ECJ. ""Now I would have thought the UK would like to continue welcoming nuclear scientists, who are all probably being paid six figures and are paying lots of tax,"" he said. ""But we're withdrawing from it because of this absolutist position on the European Court."" He added: ""If she doesn't shift on this I think Parliament will do it for her."" He also took a swipe at the ability of ministers in Mrs May's top team, which he said was ""not groaning with talent"". ""I think a political party is in a bad place when there's more talented people on its back benches than there are on the front benches."" He said the cabinet's leading ""Brexiteers"", David Davis and Boris Johnson, were ""actually pretty liberal on issues like immigration"" and would like to ""recalibrate"" Mrs May's position, ""but at the moment she is showing no willingness to do this"". Mr Chapman stopped working for David Davis at the election and is now a partner at lobbying company Bell Pottinger.

"The boys were left at home in Bradford while their mother flew to Paris to organise her wedding Two young boys were left home alone in Bradford with just a pan of soup to eat when their mother went on a two-day trip to Paris, a court has heard. The brothers, aged six and 11, were found by police after the younger boy told his teacher his mum was in France. The single mother had taken the trip to make arrangements for her wedding to a man she met online. She was sentenced to six months in jail, suspended for a year after admitting two charges of child neglect. Bradford Crown Court heard earlier the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to Manchester Airport in March and boarded a flight to Paris leaving the youngsters ""home alone"". Prosecutor Philip Adams told the court she intended to fly back the next day, but would not have arrived home until about midnight. The court was told the younger boy's school tried unsuccessfully to contact his mother before his older brother turned up to collect him. He was allowed to go with his brother, but the school alerted police and the boys were placed in overnight accommodation. Their mother was arrested the following day when she returned. She told police she had travelled to Paris to make arrangements to marry and had initially wanted the boys to stay with a friend. She said she was then ""persuaded"" by her older son that he and his brother would be fine at home. Defending her, Tom Rushbrooke said she realised that she had made a ""terrible mistake"", and in all other respects was a caring mother. Sentencing her, Judge Robert Bartfield told her she had put them ""in significant danger"". However, he said the case was different from those where people went on holiday leaving small children behind, and fortunately no harm was done. Judge Bartfield said as the boys had only recently been returned to their mother, this had persuaded him not to impose an immediate jail sentence. The court also heard that she still hoped to go ahead with her wedding.

"This video can not be played Police and emergency services personnel enter the hospital A gunman has opened fire with an assault rifle inside a hospital in the Bronx borough of New York, killing one doctor and injuring six other people, five of them seriously. The gunman, a former doctor at the hospital, killed himself in the attack. The shooting began at about 14:55 local time (18:55 GMT) at the 1,000-bed Bronx-Lebanon Hospital. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the shooting was not an act of terrorism, but rather workplace-related. He said the attack had been a ""horrific situation in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort"". Several of the injured are ""fighting for their lives,"" he said, adding that the doctor killed in the attack was a woman. Police said the suspect was wearing a white medical coat when found. An assault rifle was also discovered nearby, which a local politician separately said appeared to be a military-grade M16 rifle. Police confirmed this Facebook image to be that of Henry Bello Police Commissioner James O'Neill said the attack began on the 16th floor and all the victims were shot on the 16th and 17th floors. The gunman has not been officially named but police sources told US media he was Henry Bello, 45, a former family-medicine doctor at the hospital. Sources quoted by NBC said he had resigned in 2015 in lieu of termination. Mr O'Neill said the gunman had tried to set himself on fire and died of a self-inflicted wound. Messages on social media spoke of doctors and nurses barricading themselves inside the building in the Mount Hope district. New York police urged the public to avoid the area around the hospital at 1650 Grand Concourse Doctors were among those injured One patient in the radiology department, Felix Puno, tweeted: ""Building is in complete shut down, I was in the middle of getting an X-ray when security alerted us to the active shooter situation."" Garry Trimble, whose fiancÃ©e works at the hospital, said security was not good enough. This video can not be played Mayor Bill de Blasio said the shooting was isolated and appeared to be ""workplace-related"" He said: ""I can walk through the back door with an employee. If the employee opens the door, I can walk in. I think every hospital should have one police officer at each entrance. They only ever do something when something happens."" Bronx-Lebanon is a private, not-for-profit hospital that has been operating for 120 years. Shootings at hospitals are not common, but there have been several such instances in recent years. In 2015, a man entered a Boston hospital and asked for a cardiologist by name, shooting him dead when he arrived. During the investigation, it emerged that the man's mother had previously been a patient at the hospital. In July 2016, another man opened fire in a patient's room at a Florida medical centre, killing an elderly woman and a hospital worker. The suspect was later deemed to suffer from mental health issues, casting doubt over his competency to stand trial. In July last year, a patient at a Berlin hospital shot a doctor before turning the gun on himself. The city had also seen a shooting outside another hospital earlier in the year, in which no-one was killed. Are you in the area?

"Messi first met his future bride when he was just five years old Argentine football star Lionel Messi has married his childhood sweetheart in his hometown in what has been called the ""wedding of the century"". A civil ceremony for Messi, 30, and Antonela Roccuzzo, 29, was held at a luxury hotel in the city of Rosario. Football stars and celebrities were among the 260 guests, with hundreds of police deployed for the event. Messi, the Argentina and Barcelona forward, met Roccuzzo as a child before he moved to Spain aged just 13. Among the guests at Friday's wedding were Messi's Barcelona teammates Luis SuÃ¡rez, Neymar, Gerard PiquÃ© and his wife, Colombia's pop star Shakira. A number of guests flew into Rosario on private jets. Argentina's ClarÃ­n newspaper has variously called the wedding ""the wedding of the year"" and ""the wedding of the century"". Many of Messi's former teammates, including Xavi Hernandez, Cesc FÃ bregas and Carles Puyol attended with their partners Argentine footballer Ezequiel Lavezzi was also spotted on the red carpet Gerard PiquÃ© (left) and his wife Shakira posed for a picture with airport staff as they arrived in Rosario Crowds gathered outside the hotel in Rosario Earlier, crowds gathered at the local airport to try to spot some of the famous guests. A private security firm was working inside the hotel to keep out potential gatecrashers. About 150 journalists received accreditation to enter a special press area, but were not given full access to the venue, organisers said. Artist Lisandro Urteaga paints a celebratory mural of Messi on a wall in Rosario ahead of the wedding Messi met Roccuzzo when he was just five years old. She is the cousin of his best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who also became a professional football player. Messi accepted an offer to play for Barcelona when he was 13, on condition that they pay for treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Meet the Iranian Messi Messi statue decapitated in Buenos Aires He has spoken about the difficulties he faced on leaving behind his loved ones and former club. Lionel Messi is joined on the pitch by Antonela Roccuzzo and the couple's two sons The couple, who now live in Barcelona, have two sons together. In May, his appeal against a 21-month jail term for tax evasion in Spain was rejected. He is unlikely to go to prison as the sentence can be served under probation or possiblyavoided by paying a fine. The event was held at Rosario's City Center hotel complex, which has an adjoining casino. Rosario's Hotel CityCenter set up for a previous event Roccuzzo, 29, was widely expected to wear a dress by Rosa Clara, a Barcelona-based designer who has dressed actress Eva Longoria and Spain's Queen Letizia. Aside from a ""sushi station"", the menu was a very Argentine affair, including empanadas (traditional pasties) and all parts of the cow, from a casserole of sweetbreads to blood sausage. Messi invited the Barcelona squad, including Neymar, Luis SuÃ¡rez and Gerard PiquÃ©, who arrived in Rosario in a private jet with his wife, Colombian pop-star Shakira. Teammates from Argentina's national team, including Sergio AgÃ¼ero, were also present. ClarÃ­n reported that Messi did not invite any of his recent coaches, including Pep Guardiola, who is now at Manchester City. Argentina's other big football legend, Diego Maradona, was also omitted from the list, according to the local press. Uruguayan footballer Luis SuÃ¡rez touches down in Rosario for his teammate's big day The port city of Rosario sits on the banks of the ParanÃ¡, about 300km north-west of Buenos Aires in the centre of the country. Another famous Argentine to have spent his early years here is Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Messi is known locally simply as LÃ­o. A mural of Che Guevara next to the Newell's Old Boys club logo He has been a local hero since his days as a star player for Newell's Old Boys. The team has a staunch rivalry with nearby Rosario Central, similar to that of Boca Juniors and River Plate in Buenos Aires.

"Venus Williams had recently been eliminated from the French Open when the crash occurred Venus Williams faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of a man who died in a Florida car crash involving the tennis star, says a lawyer. The 78-year-old man suffered ""massive"" fatal injuries from the 9 June collision in Palm Beach Gardens city, an attorney for his widow says. According to police, Ms Williams was at fault for the traffic accident, which caused the death of Jerome Barson. The 37-year-old is due to make her 20th appearance at Wimbledon on Monday. According to the police report, Linda Barson told police she was driving with her husband, Jerome, in the passenger seat of their 2016 Hyundai Accent at the time of the collision. Mrs Barson told police that as they passed through an intersection on a green light, Ms Williams' 2010 Toyota Sequoia cut across in front of their car. The Barsons had been married for over 30 years Ms Williams told police she became stuck in the middle of the intersection because of other traffic, according to the report. ""Mrs Barson is suffering intense grief and doesn't know how she will go on,"" her lawyer, Michael Steinger, told ABC television's Good Morning America. ""Her husband of 35 years was struck by Venus Williams, who was at fault in a car accident, which ultimately resulted in Mr Barson being hospitalised 14 days with multiple surgeries which resulted in his death."" The lawsuit, filed by the couple's daughter, Audrey Gassner-Dunayer, asserts that her father's injuries included ""severed main arteries, massive internal bleeding, a fractured spine, and massive internal organ damage"". The Barsons' car was ""crushed, the front windshield shattered, the airbags deployed, there was crush damage to the rear on the driver's side, and the back window was shattered"", the lawsuit states. The lawyer added: ""At this point, we are attempting to both preserve the evidence and gain access to evidence."" Mr Barson died in hospital on 22 June, his wife Linda's 68th birthday. Mrs Barson was also admitted to hospital after the crash. Ms Williams was not hurt. According to a police report obtained by US media, Ms Williams ""is at fault for violating the right of way of"" the Barsons' vehicle. Ms Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, witnesses told police. The police incident report says that the estimated speed of Ms Williams' vehicle at the time was 5mph (8km/h). In a statement to US media, the tennis star's lawyer, Malcolm Cunningham, said: ""Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. ""Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. ""This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one."" The accident occurred just days after the seven-time Grand Slam champion was eliminated from the French Open. She has not been criminally charged. Ms Williams is currently in London to train for the Wimbledon tournament, which she has won five times - most recently in 2008. The All England Club tournament begins on Monday.

"When Terry Gobanga - then Terry Apudo - didn't show up to her wedding, nobody could have guessed that she had been abducted, raped and left for dead by the roadside. It was the first of two tragedies to hit the young Nairobi pastor in quick succession. But she is a survivor. It was going to be a very big wedding. I was a pastor, so all our church members were coming, as well as all our relatives.  My fiance, Harry, and I were very excited - we were getting married in All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi and I had rented a beautiful dress. But the night before the wedding I realised that I had some of Harry's clothes, including his cravat. He couldn't show up without a tie, so a friend who had stayed the night offered to take it to him first thing in the morning. We got up at dawn and I walked her to the bus station. As I was making my way back home, I walked past a guy sitting on the bonnet of a car - suddenly he grabbed me from behind and dumped me in the back seat. There were two more men inside, and they drove off.  It all happened in a fraction of a second. A piece of cloth was stuffed in my mouth. I was kicking and hitting out and trying to scream. When I managed to push the gag out, I screamed: ""It's my wedding day!"" That was when I got the first blow. One of the men told me to ""co-operate or you will die"". Listen to Terry Gobangatalking to Outlook on the BBC World Service Subscribe to the Outlook podcast The men took turns to rape me. I felt sure I was going to die, but I was still fighting for my life, so when one of the men took the gag out of my mouth I bit his manhood. He screamed in pain and one of them stabbed me in the stomach. Then they opened the door and threw me out of the moving car. I was miles from home, outside Nairobi. More than six hours had passed since I had been abducted. A child saw me being thrown out and called her grandmother. People came running. When the police came they tried to get a pulse, but no-one could. Thinking I was dead, they wrapped me in a blanket and started to take me to the mortuary. But on the way there, I choked on the blanket and coughed. The policeman said: ""She's alive?"" And he turned the car around and drove me to the biggest government hospital in Kenya. I arrived in great shock, murmuring incoherently. I was half-naked and covered in blood, and my face was swollen from being punched. But something must have alerted the matron, because she guessed I was a bride. ""Let's go around the churches to see if they're missing a bride,"" she told the nurses. All Saint's Cathedral is the oldest Anglican cathedral in Nairobi By coincidence, the first church they called at was All Saints Cathedral. ""Are you missing a bride?"" the nurse asked. The minister said: ""Yes, there was a wedding at 10 o'clock and she didn't come."" When I didn't show up to the church, my parents were panicking. People were sent out to search for me. Rumours flew. Some wondered: ""Did she change her mind?"" Others said: ""No, it's so unlike her, what happened?"" After a few hours, they had to take down the decorations to make room for the next ceremony. Harry had been put in the vestry to wait. When they heard where I was, my parents came to the hospital with the whole entourage. Harry was actually carrying my wedding gown. But the media had also got wind of the story so there were reporters too. I was moved to another hospital where I'd have more privacy. That was where the doctors stitched me up and gave me some devastating news: ""The stab wound went deep into your womb, so you won't be able to carry any children."" I was given the morning-after pill, as well as antiretroviral drugs to protect me from HIV and Aids. My mind shut down, it refused to accept what had happened. Harry kept saying he still wanted to marry me. ""I want to take care of her and make sure she comes back to good health in my arms, in our house,"" he said. Truth be told, I wasn't in a position to say Yes or No because my mind was so jammed with the faces of the three men, and with everything that had happened. A few days later, when I was less sedated, I was able to look him in the eye. I kept saying sorry. I felt like I had let him down. Some people said it was my own fault for leaving the house in the morning. It was really hurtful, but my family and Harry supported me. The police never caught the rapists. I went to line-up after line-up but I didn't recognise any of the men, and it hurt me each time I went. It set back my recovery - it was 10 steps forward, 20 back. In the end I went back to the police station and said: ""You know what, I'm done. I just want to leave it."" Three months after the attack I was told I was HIV-negative and got really excited, but they told me I had to wait three more months to be sure. Still, Harry and I began to plan our second wedding. Although I had been very angry at the press intrusion, somebody read my story and asked to meet me. Her name was Vip Ogolla, and she was also a rape survivor. We spoke, and she told me she and her friends wanted to give me a free wedding. ""Go wild, have whatever you want,"" she said. I was ecstatic. I went for a different type of cake, much more expensive. Instead of a rented gown, now I could have one that was totally mine. In July 2005, seven months after our first planned wedding, Harry and I got married and went on a honeymoon. Harry Olwande and Terry on their wedding day in July 2005 Twenty-nine days later, we were at home on a very cold night. Harry lit a charcoal burner and took it to the bedroom. After dinner, he removed it because the room was really warm. I got under the covers as he locked up the house. When he came to bed he said he was feeling dizzy, but we thought nothing of it. It was so cold we couldn't sleep, so I suggested getting another duvet. But Harry said he couldn't get it as he didn't have enough strength. Strangely, I couldn't stand up either. We realised something was very wrong. He passed out. I passed out. I remember coming to. I would call him. At times he would respond, at other times he wouldn't. I pushed myself out of bed and threw up, which gave me some strength. I started crawling to the phone. I called my neighbour and said: ""Something is wrong, Harry is not responding."" She came over immediately but it took me ages to crawl to the front door to let her in as I kept passing out. I saw an avalanche of people coming in, screaming. And I passed out again. I woke up in hospital and asked where my husband was. They said they were working on him in the next room. I said: ""I'm a pastor, I've seen quite a lot in my life, I need you to be very straight with me."" The doctor looked at me and said: ""I'm sorry, your husband did not make it."" I couldn't believe it. Terry places a ring on Harry's finger Going back to church for the funeral was terrible. Just a month earlier I had been there in my white dress, with Harry standing at the front looking handsome in his suit. Now, I was in black and he was being wheeled in, in a casket. People thought I was cursed and held back their children from me. ""There's a bad omen hanging over her,"" they said. At one point, I actually believed it myself. Others accused me of killing my husband. That really got me down - I was grieving. The post-mortem showed what really happened: as the carbon monoxide filled his system, he started choking and suffocated. I had a terrible breakdown. I felt let down by God, I felt let down by everybody. I couldn't believe that people could be laughing, going out and just going about life. I crashed. One day I was sitting on the balcony looking at the birds chirping away and I said: ""God, how can you take care of the birds and not me?"" In that instant I remembered there are 24 hours a day - sitting in depression with your curtains closed, no-one's going to give you back those 24 hours. Before you know, it's a week, a month, a year wasted away. That was a tough reality. I told everybody I would never ever get married again. God took my husband, and the thought of ever going through such a loss again was too much. It's something I wouldn't wish on anybody. The pain is so intense, you feel it in your nails. But there was one man - Tonny Gobanga - who kept visiting. He would encourage me to talk about my husband and think about the good times. One time he didn't call for three days and I was so angry. That's when it hit me that I had fallen for him. Tonny and Terry Gobanga Tonny proposed marriage but I told him to buy a magazine, read my story and tell me if he still loved me. He came back and said he still wanted to marry me. But I said: ""Listen, there's another thing - I can't have children, so I cannot get married to you."" ""Children are a gift from God,"" he said. ""If we get them, Amen. If not, I will have more time to love you."" I thought: ""Wow, what a line!"" So I said Yes. Tonny went home to tell his parents, who were very excited, until they heard my story. ""You can't marry her - she is cursed,"" they said. My father-in-law refused to attend the wedding, but we went ahead anyway. We had 800 guests - many came out of curiosity. It was three years after my first wedding, and I was very scared. When we were exchanging vows, I thought: ""Here I am again Father, please don't let him die."" As the congregation prayed for us I cried uncontrollably. A year into our marriage, I felt unwell and went to the doctor - and to my great surprise he told me that I was pregnant. As the months progressed I was put on total bed rest, because of the stab wound to my womb. But all went well, and we had a baby girl who we called Tehille. Four years later, we had another baby girl named Towdah. Today, I am the best of friends with my father-in-law. I wrote a book, Crawling out of Darkness, about my ordeal, to give people hope of rising again. I also started an organisation called Kara Olmurani. We work with rape survivors, as I call them - not rape victims. We offer counselling and support. We are looking to start a halfway house for them where they can come and find their footing before going back to face the world. I have forgiven my attackers. It wasn't easy but I realised I was getting a raw deal by being upset with people who probably don't care. My faith also encourages me to forgive and not repay evil with evil but with good. The most important thing is to mourn. Go through every step of it. Get upset until you are willing to do something about your situation. You have to keep moving, crawl if you have to. But move towards your destiny because it's waiting, and you have to go and get it.

"Joe Furness slept in a hire car during his 12-hour stopover in Menorca A student discovered it was cheaper to fly from Newcastle to London via Menorca than to take the train. When Joe Furness, 21, decided on a last-minute trip to see friends, the lowest rail fare he found was Â£78.50. But after an internet search the trainee marine officer found the same journey, including a 12-hour stopover on the Spanish island, for Â£26.98. He said it showed train travel in the UK had become ""ridiculously expensive"". Mr Furness, from Oldham, is a trainee cadet with shipping firm Maersk and is studying at South Shields Marine College. As well as the flights, he also spent Â£7.50 on a hire car, which he slept in, and splashed out on a Â£4 cocktail - meaning his entire trip was Â£40 cheaper than taking the train. By train: Newcastle to London = Â£78.50 By air: Newcastle to Menorca = Â£15.99 Menorca to London = Â£10.99 Car hire = Â£7.50 Cocktail = Â£4 Total = Â£38.48 Mr Furness admitted the trip was ""no good for anyone who needs to do a commute"". ""But it does show how cheap it can be to travel and have a bit of fun at the same time,"" he added. ""I had a great time, saw a festival, drove around the island for a bit and met loads of people. ""Trains in the UK have become ridiculously expensive. I've never once got on a train and got off at the other end thinking I've had value for money."" Mr Furnessmade a video of his trip,external, which took a total of 22 hours and consisted of a flight out of Newcastle to Menorca with Thomas Cook on 23 June for Â£15.99. His return flight to London Gatwick the next day cost Â£10.99 with the same airline. Mr Furness uses comparison sites to find the cheapest flights This is not the first time Mr Furness claims to have found cheaper flights than trains. He said he recently travelled from Newcastle to Manchester via Geneva by air at a cost of Â£39 when the cheapest train ticket he could find would have cost Â£64. He added: ""I use comparison sites to find the cheapest flight from my departure point to anywhere in the world. Then find the cheapest from there to my destination. ""This time I found it was way cheaper to go via Menorca. It took a lot longer, but I think it's still better than sitting on a train for four hours.""

"Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry Charlie Gard's parents have been told they will be able to spend more time with their terminally ill baby. Chris Gard and Connie Yates had been expecting their 10-month-old's life support to be turned off on Friday. Great Ormond Street Hospital has since disclosed it is putting plans in place for Charlie's care to allow his family to spend more time with him. On Tuesday,Charlie's parents lost their final legal appealto take him to the US for experimental treatment. Judges at the European Court of Human Rights concluded that further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"", in line with advice from specialists at Great Ormond Street. He has a rare genetic disease as well as brain damage and is believed to be one of 16 children in the world to have the condition; mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for experimental treatment for Charlie Doctors have said he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October 2016. His parents said they had been denied their final wish to be able to take their son home to die and felt ""let down"" following the lengthy legal battle. Alongside a video posted on YouTube on Thursday, Charlie's parents wrote: ""We are utterly heartbroken spending our last precious hours with our baby boy. ""We're not allowed to choose if our son lives and we're not allowed to choose when or where Charlie dies. ""We, and most importantly Charlie, have been massively let down throughout this whole process.""

"This video can not be played Nick Paget-Brown: ""I have to accept my share of responsibility"" Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Nick Paget-Brown has resigned following continued criticism of the council's handling of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Mr Paget-Brown faced calls to resign from London Mayor Sadiq Khan and a number of other senior politicians. It comes after an aborted meeting of the council's cabinet in which leaders had tried to ban members of the public and press. At least 80 people are believed to have died in the blaze on 14 June. Grenfell Tower: Cladding 'changed to cheaper version' What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? London fire: Six questions for the investigation London fire: A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Announcing his resignation, Mr Paget-Brown said he had to accept responsibility for ""perceived failings"" by the council after thetragedy.. ""I have therefore decided to step down as leader of the council as soon as a successor is in place,"" he said. Members of the public and press had been barred from the council meeting until a court order overturned the decision minutes before it was due to start Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is clearly a personal matter for the leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, as well as the council. ""However, given local people had lost confidence in the leader, it is right that he has stepped aside."" He said the government's priority ""remains focussed on the ongoing response efforts and providing all necessary support to those affected by this tragic incident"". Deputy council leader and cabinet member for housing, property and regeneration, Rock Feilding-Mellen, also announced his resignation. The decision to adjourn Thursday night's meeting led to a rebuke from Downing Street on Friday. A Number 10 spokesman said: ""The High Court ruled that the meeting should be open and we would have expected the council to respect that."" This video can not be played Council tries to ban press and public from meeting Council leaders claimed an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry. But angry protests followed and Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded the abandoned meeting a ""fiasco"". Mr Atkinson, the Labour group leader on Kensington and Chelsea, told the BBC he was ""ashamed"" of the authority. He accused leaders of ""hiding from residents, they have been hiding from backbench councillors for over a week"". Residents condemned the response to the tragedy calling it ""absolute chaos"" as relief efforts on the ground were limited. They said there was little or no co-ordination in the immediate days after the disaster with claims council officials were nowhere to be seen. It was accused of failing to provide enough support or information to those who had been made homeless. It tried to hold the first cabinet meeting since the disaster behind closed doors. After a High Court order ruled it should be open to the public, the council adjourned the meeting after 20 minutes claiming an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the inquiry. The London mayor demanded the resignation of the entire council leadership on Friday morning, adding the council's decision to scrap the meeting ""beggars belief"". Mr Khan welcomed Mr Paget-Brown stepping down, saying:  ""Ever since the awful events of two weeks ago, it has been clear that the local community in and around north Kensington has lost trust in the council and that the administration is not fit for purpose. ""Last night's decision to abandon the council's cabinet meeting has merely compounded the misery for local people who are grieving, traumatised and desperate for answers."" Mr Khan latertweeted a letter,externalhe sent to the prime minister, asking her to appoint commissioners to take over the running of the council until next May's council elections. The fire at the 24-storey block in North Kensington destroyed 151 homes, both in the tower and surrounding areas. Documents obtained by the BBCsuggest cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment was changed to a cheaper version, which was less fire resistant. Mr Paget-Brown said many ""questions about the cause of the fire and how it spread so quickly"" would need to be answered by the public inquiry. He added: ""The scale of this tragedy was always going to mean that one borough alone would never have sufficient resources to respond to all the needs of the survivors and those made homeless on its own. ""We have been very lucky to have the support of other London boroughs, the emergency services and community associations based in north Kensington and I'm very grateful to them."" Mr Paget-Brown said the council had been criticised for not answering ""all of the questions people had"". He said that was ""properly a matter for the public inquiry"". Deputy council leader Rock Feilding-Mellen has also resigned But he said his decision to accept legal advice that he ""should not compromise the public inquiry by having an open discussion in public"" on Thursday night had ""itself become a political story"". ""It cannot be right that this should have become the focus of attention when so many are dead or still unaccounted for,"" he added. Announcing his resignation, Mr Feilding-Mellen said it had been suggested several times since the blaze that he should step down but he had felt it was his ""duty"" to back the council's efforts to help the victims. ""It will be for others to judge whether it would have been better for me to resign immediately, but I would have found it hard to forgive myself if I had ducked out at such a moment of crisis for the borough,"" he said. Cladding on at least 149 high-rise buildings across 45 local authority areas in England hasfailed fire safety tests. Last weekend, Camden Borough Council evacuated five tower blocks which were found to have the same flammable cladding as that of Grenfell Tower.

"The deal struck this week between the Conservatives and the DUP gives the government a majority in the House of Commons on certain votes, enabling it to win the vote on the Queen's Speech. With the DUP, it has a majority of six across all 650 MPs- but with the seven Sinn Fein MPs not taking their seats, in practice it is a working majority of 13. That's still an uncomfortably small number. It would only take a rebellion of seven people to defeat the government if all opposition MPs were to vote together. We have already seen how the government has had to be more responsive to its backbenchers, conceding to demandsthat women from Northern Ireland should be able to receive free abortions in England. But it is not just rebellions that the government needs to worry about. The majority could be eroded over time if the Conservatives or DUP were to lose seats at by-elections. Jim Callaghan (left) and Sir John Major both lost their majorities Seven losses might sound a lot but if we look back at previous parliaments it is by no means unprecedented. Just ask Jim Callaghan or Sir John Major. Their governments lost their majorities because of illness, defection and death. The Conservative government suffered a net loss of eight seats at by-elections between 1992 and 1997; and seven seats between 1987 and 1992. The 1974-79 Labour government also lost seven seats, eliminating its wafer-thin majority and ultimately leading to defeat in a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons. These turbulent times were dramatised on the West End stage in the play This House, which showed how, in 1978 and 1979, MPs were taken to votes in ambulances. Government whips also had special keys to unlock toilet doors to ensure drunken MPs weren't napping on the toilet. Between 1966 and 1970 Labour's net loss was 15 seats. That was a particularly tough Parliament for the Labour Party because 20 sitting MPs died, as those elected two decades earlier in the 1945 landslide fell to ill health and old age. In the 1960s, many Labour MPs had endured harder lives than their Conservative counterparts because they often came from manual professions such as mining or factory work. The table below shows how many seats governing parties have gained or lost at by-elections over the course of each parliament since World War Two. In four of those 19 parliaments, the government lost at least seven seats. It means that Theresa May doesn't just have to fear backbench rebellions; she also has to fear illness, defection and death.

"Messi first met his future bride when he was just five years old Argentine football star Lionel Messi has married his childhood sweetheart in his hometown in what has been called the ""wedding of the century"". A civil ceremony for Messi, 30, and Antonela Roccuzzo, 29, was held at a luxury hotel in the city of Rosario. Football stars and celebrities were among the 260 guests, with hundreds of police deployed for the event. Messi, the Argentina and Barcelona forward, met Roccuzzo as a child before he moved to Spain aged just 13. Among the guests at Friday's wedding were Messi's Barcelona teammates Luis SuÃ¡rez, Neymar, Gerard PiquÃ© and his wife, Colombia's pop star Shakira. A number of guests flew into Rosario on private jets. Argentina's ClarÃ­n newspaper has variously called the wedding ""the wedding of the year"" and ""the wedding of the century"". Many of Messi's former teammates, including Xavi Hernandez, Cesc FÃ bregas and Carles Puyol attended with their partners Argentine footballer Ezequiel Lavezzi was also spotted on the red carpet Gerard PiquÃ© (left) and his wife Shakira posed for a picture with airport staff as they arrived in Rosario Crowds gathered outside the hotel in Rosario Earlier, crowds gathered at the local airport to try to spot some of the famous guests. A private security firm was working inside the hotel to keep out potential gatecrashers. About 150 journalists received accreditation to enter a special press area, but were not given full access to the venue, organisers said. Artist Lisandro Urteaga paints a celebratory mural of Messi on a wall in Rosario ahead of the wedding Messi met Roccuzzo when he was just five years old. She is the cousin of his best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who also became a professional football player. Messi accepted an offer to play for Barcelona when he was 13, on condition that they pay for treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Meet the Iranian Messi Messi statue decapitated in Buenos Aires He has spoken about the difficulties he faced on leaving behind his loved ones and former club. Lionel Messi is joined on the pitch by Antonela Roccuzzo and the couple's two sons The couple, who now live in Barcelona, have two sons together. In May, his appeal against a 21-month jail term for tax evasion in Spain was rejected. He is unlikely to go to prison as the sentence can be served under probation or possiblyavoided by paying a fine. The event was held at Rosario's City Center hotel complex, which has an adjoining casino. Rosario's Hotel CityCenter set up for a previous event Roccuzzo, 29, was widely expected to wear a dress by Rosa Clara, a Barcelona-based designer who has dressed actress Eva Longoria and Spain's Queen Letizia. Aside from a ""sushi station"", the menu was a very Argentine affair, including empanadas (traditional pasties) and all parts of the cow, from a casserole of sweetbreads to blood sausage. Messi invited the Barcelona squad, including Neymar, Luis SuÃ¡rez and Gerard PiquÃ©, who arrived in Rosario in a private jet with his wife, Colombian pop-star Shakira. Teammates from Argentina's national team, including Sergio AgÃ¼ero, were also present. ClarÃ­n reported that Messi did not invite any of his recent coaches, including Pep Guardiola, who is now at Manchester City. Argentina's other big football legend, Diego Maradona, was also omitted from the list, according to the local press. Uruguayan footballer Luis SuÃ¡rez touches down in Rosario for his teammate's big day The port city of Rosario sits on the banks of the ParanÃ¡, about 300km north-west of Buenos Aires in the centre of the country. Another famous Argentine to have spent his early years here is Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Messi is known locally simply as LÃ­o. A mural of Che Guevara next to the Newell's Old Boys club logo He has been a local hero since his days as a star player for Newell's Old Boys.

"This video can not be played Trump's tweets: Four women, two takes Two TV presenters attacked on Twitter by President Donald Trump have accused him of lying and suggested the White House tried to blackmail them. The hosts of MSNBC Morning Joe said they were warned a tabloid would run a negative story on them unless they said sorry for their coverage of Mr Trump. Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough said Mr Trump's tweets were ""vicious"" and ""frightening"". The president called them ""low IQ crazy Mika"" and ""Psycho Joe"" on Thursday. He also referred to Ms Brzezinski as ""bleeding badly from a facelift"". The couple, who are engaged to be married, wrote a joint response in Friday'sWashington Post,externalaccusing the president of an ""unhealthy obsession"" with them. National Enquirer: Trump's mouthpiece? What started yesterday as an undignified personal spat between Donald Trump and the hosts of a cable news show has morphed into something much more sinister - allegations of White House machinations that tread ever so close to outright blackmail. If what Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough say is true, they were the targets of political dark arts reminiscent of the schemes of the Watergate ""fixers"" during the Nixon White House. Could Trump aides have really used the threat of an embarrassing story in a tabloid newspaper to pressure the two hosts to provide more favourable coverage? The Trump administration will surely deny the charges, although the president himself lent some corroboration by tweeting that Scarborough asked him to tell the National Enquirer to bury an article about him. That the president said he rejected such a request only raises more questions about the editorial control Mr Trump may have over a newspaper that routinely targeted his political opponents in 2016. Where this story goes from here is anyone's guess. Chances are, however, that the president - via his unchecked Twitter megaphone - will only add fuel to the fire. Co-presenters Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were both targets of Donald Trump's Twitter tirade They denied his claims they had spent three nights at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last New Year's Eve and that they had ""insisted"" on spending time with him. Instead they said they turned down his invitation to attend his festive party. They continued: ""Putting aside Mr Trump's never-ending obsession with women's blood, Mika and her face were perfectly intact, as pictures from that night reveal."" On their morning show, Ms Brzezinski denied having had a face-lift, saying she had a procedure to get the skin under her chin ""tweaked"". Does Trump's latest tweet storm matter? This video can not be played Chaos erupts in the Oval Office The TV presenters also said three White House officials had told them the National Enquirer would publish a negative article about them unless they apologised to Mr Trump for their scrutiny of him. Mr Scarborough said: ""They said, 'if you call the president up and you apologise for your coverage then he'll pick up the phone and basically spike the story.'"" ""I had, I will just say, three people at the very top of the administration calling me."" Ms Brzezinski said reporters from the supermarket tabloid began harassing her family. ""They were calling my children,"" she said. ""They were calling close friends. ""These calls persisted for quite some time and then Joe had the conversations that he had with the White House where they said 'oh, this could go away'."" David Pecker, chief executive of the Enquirer's parent company, is a staunch ally of Mr Trump, which is reflected in the tabloid's coverage of the president. But in a Friday morning tweet, Mr Trump denied the couple's claims, saying Mr Scarborough ""called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no!"" This video can not be played The MSNBC hosts say the White House demanded an apology for coverage, or the National Enquirer would run a story on them Mr Scarborough swiftly hit back: ""Yet another lie. I have texts from your top aides and phone records. Also, those records show I haven't spoken with you in many months."" Mr Scarborough also said that a ""well-known congressman"" had told him that the president went on a ""rant"" against the show during a meeting with around 20 legislators at the White House to discuss efforts to pass healthcare legislation. ""I've been in politics my whole life. â¦ He scared me,"" Mr Scarborough said, describing what the source had told him. ""Because he was vicious when he turned from you to Mika,"" he described being told. ""His face was red. He started talking about blood coming out of her ears, out of her eyes."" Democrats held a news conference condemning President Trump's tweets The Enquirer's owner said on Friday morning the tabloid had published a story at the beginning of June about the couple's relationship ""the truth of which is not in dispute"". Dylan Howard, vice-president of the publication's parent company, added in the statement: ""We have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions."" The Enquirer's Twitter account retweeted their article on Friday, with a headline about ""Morning Joe Couple's Sleazy Cheating Scandal!"" Mr Trump's original tweet about the MSNBC hosts provoked a storm of criticism, including even from some fellow Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Trump's remarks on Thursday were ""beneath the office"" of president. ""Please just stop. This isn't normal,"" tweeted fellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse. The Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Mr Trump's tweets ""sexist, an assault on the freedom of the press & an insult to all women"". The White House sprang to Mr Trump's defence. ""I don't think that the president has ever been someone that gets attacked and doesn't push back,"" spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News. In a previous spat withjournalist Megyn Kelly,Mr Trump referred to ""blood coming out of her wherever"", implying her work was being affected by her menstrual cycle. The Morning Joe co-presenters have increasingly attacked President Trump since he took office. In recent weeks, Mr Scarborough has called him a ""bumbling dope"", while Ms Brzezinski has called him ""phony"", a ""narcissist"" and accused him of ""destroying the country"". Ms Brzezinski is the daughter of the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, while Mr Scarborough is a former Republican congressman.

"This video can not be played Police and emergency services personnel enter the hospital A gunman has opened fire with an assault rifle inside a hospital in the Bronx borough of New York, killing one doctor and injuring six other people, five of them seriously. The gunman, a former doctor at the hospital, killed himself in the attack. The shooting began at about 14:55 local time (18:55 GMT) at the 1,000-bed Bronx-Lebanon Hospital. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the shooting was not an act of terrorism, but rather workplace-related. He said the attack had been a ""horrific situation in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort"". Several of the injured are ""fighting for their lives,"" he said, adding that the doctor killed in the attack was a woman. Police said the suspect was wearing a white medical coat when found. An assault rifle was also discovered nearby, which a local politician separately said appeared to be a military-grade M16 rifle. Police confirmed this Facebook image to be that of Henry Bello Police Commissioner James O'Neill said the attack began on the 16th floor and all the victims were shot on the 16th and 17th floors. The gunman has not been officially named but police sources told US media he was Henry Bello, 45, a former family-medicine doctor at the hospital. Sources quoted by NBC said he had resigned in 2015 in lieu of termination. Mr O'Neill said the gunman had tried to set himself on fire and died of a self-inflicted wound.

New York police urged the public to avoid the area around the hospital at 1650 Grand Concourse Doctors were among those injured One patient in the radiology department, Felix Puno, tweeted: ""Building is in complete shut down, I was in the middle of getting an X-ray when security alerted us to the active shooter situation.""

"Messi first met his future bride when he was just five years old Argentine football star Lionel Messi has married his childhood sweetheart in his hometown in what has been called the ""wedding of the century"". A civil ceremony for Messi, 30, and Antonela Roccuzzo, 29, was held at a luxury hotel in the city of Rosario. Football stars and celebrities were among the 260 guests, with hundreds of police deployed for the event. Messi, the Argentina and Barcelona forward, met Roccuzzo as a child before he moved to Spain aged just 13. Among the guests at Friday's wedding were Messi's Barcelona teammates Luis SuÃ¡rez, Neymar, Gerard PiquÃ© and his wife, Colombia's pop star Shakira. A number of guests flew into Rosario on private jets. Argentina's ClarÃ­n newspaper has variously called the wedding ""the wedding of the year"" and ""the wedding of the century"". Many of Messi's former teammates, including Xavi Hernandez, Cesc FÃ bregas and Carles Puyol attended with their partners Argentine footballer Ezequiel Lavezzi was also spotted on the red carpet Gerard PiquÃ© (left) and his wife Shakira posed for a picture with airport staff as they arrived in Rosario Crowds gathered outside the hotel in Rosario Earlier, crowds gathered at the local airport to try to spot some of the famous guests. A private security firm was working inside the hotel to keep out potential gatecrashers. About 150 journalists received accreditation to enter a special press area, but were not given full access to the venue, organisers said. Artist Lisandro Urteaga paints a celebratory mural of Messi on a wall in Rosario ahead of the wedding Messi met Roccuzzo when he was just five years old. She is the cousin of his best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who also became a professional football player. Messi accepted an offer to play for Barcelona when he was 13, on condition that they pay for treatment for his growth hormone deficiency. Meet the Iranian Messi Messi statue decapitated in Buenos Aires He has spoken about the difficulties he faced on leaving behind his loved ones and former club. Lionel Messi is joined on the pitch by Antonela Roccuzzo and the couple's two sons The couple, who now live in Barcelona, have two sons together. In May, his appeal against a 21-month jail term for tax evasion in Spain was rejected. He is unlikely to go to prison as the sentence can be served under probation or possiblyavoided by paying a fine. The event was held at Rosario's City Center hotel complex, which has an adjoining casino. Rosario's Hotel CityCenter set up for a previous event Roccuzzo, 29, was widely expected to wear a dress by Rosa Clara, a Barcelona-based designer who has dressed actress Eva Longoria and Spain's Queen Letizia. Aside from a ""sushi station"", the menu was a very Argentine affair, including empanadas (traditional pasties) and all parts of the cow, from a casserole of sweetbreads to blood sausage. Messi invited the Barcelona squad, including Neymar, Luis SuÃ¡rez and Gerard PiquÃ©, who arrived in Rosario in a private jet with his wife, Colombian pop-star Shakira. Teammates from Argentina's national team, including Sergio AgÃ¼ero, were also present. ClarÃ­n reported that Messi did not invite any of his recent coaches, including Pep Guardiola, who is now at Manchester City. Argentina's other big football legend, Diego Maradona, was also omitted from the list, according to the local press. Uruguayan footballer Luis SuÃ¡rez touches down in Rosario for his teammate's big day The port city of Rosario sits on the banks of the ParanÃ¡, about 300km north-west of Buenos Aires in the centre of the country. Another famous Argentine to have spent his early years here is Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Messi is known locally simply as LÃ­o. A mural of Che Guevara next to the Newell's Old Boys club logo He has been a local hero since his days as a star player for Newell's Old Boys. The team has a staunch rivalry with nearby Rosario Central, similar to that of Boca Juniors and River Plate in Buenos Aires.

"A consignment of UK breakfast cereal Weetabix has reportedly been impounded by New Zealand customs officials, after complaints it could confuse customers. The 300 boxes had been ordered by a specialist shop in Christchurch, ""A Little Bit of Britain"". But food giant Sanitarium, which owns rival brand Weet-bix, has objected to it being sold. The shop's owner has been told the cereal will only be released if a sticker is put over the Weetabix label. Sanitarium said its Weet-Bix brand was protected by international law and, in turn, was often precluded from being sold in other global markets due to the Weetabix trade mark. Lisa Wilson, of the A Little Bit of Britain shop, which specialises in UK products, said she could not understand the move, as the products looked and tasted different. The store currently sells some seven boxes of Weetabix a day.

"Seven people including five friends died at Camber last year The deaths of seven men who drowned at a beach last summer might still have happened even if there were lifeguards, a coroner has concluded. Two men died at Camber Sands, East Sussex in July, followed by five young friends a month later in August. Following a five-day inquest in Hastings, coroner Alan Craze ruled their deaths were through misadventure. Afterwards, the families of the five men said they believed lifeguards could have saved their lives. They said all five were competent swimmers but had been ""blamed for their own deaths"". The RNLI had precommended employing lifeguards previously. This video can not be played Kabinuja Srithavarajah's brother Gurushanth was among those who died Recording his conclusions, Mr Craze said: ""The RNLI had recommended, amongst other measures, deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but this had not happened. ""Of course, it is not known whether such a step would have prevented the deaths, but it has now been implemented."" Q&A: What happened at Camber Sands? Mr Craze said he would be sending off a prevention of future deaths letter with official figures highlighting his concerns, including those over the control of risk assessments. The inquest had heard that there was no legal requirement for Rother District Council to follow through with recommendations contained in risk assessments by the RNLI. Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer recorded a cause of death of immersion [drowning] for all five victims who died last August. Rother District Council offered its condolences to the families and said it did not ""want anyone else to have to suffer the tragedy of losing a loved one in these circumstances"". It said it had made improvements ""year on year"" at Camber in response to the risks identified. Live: More on this story and other news from Sussex Clockwise, from top left: Kenugen Saththiyanathan, Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Nitharsan Ravi, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, Silva Da Cruz, Mohit Dupar and Gurushanth Srithavarajah Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, died alongside his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both from Erith, south-east London. Their three friends who also died were Nitharsan Ravi, 22, from Plumstead, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, from Grays, Essex and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, from Welling. Two other people had also died there a month earlier. On 24 July, Mohit Dupar, 36, from Hayes, west London, attempted to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. This video can not be played The RNLI tells PM they want signs on beaches to be as informative as road traffic signs The inquest heard the five men were all fit, healthy and competent swimmers but were unaware of ""hidden dangers"". Oceanographer Dr Simon Boxall believed they got into trouble after heading out to a sandbar to play ball a significant distance out at sea, and then got into troubleamid a fast, incoming tideas they tried to head back to shore. He told the inquest there was insufficient wave activity to build up rip currents at the beach, but there would have been strong currents that would have had a significant impact even on a strong swimmer. Nine deaths occurred at Camber in the four years from 2012, including the seven last summer. There were no lifeguards on the beach prior to the seven deaths. Instead, the area was manned by beach patrol staff whose tasks included reuniting lost children with their parents and dealing with lost property. The inquest was told that in 2013 the RNLI had offered to deploy lifeguards following a risk assessment after the death of Tanzeela Ajmal, 31, a year earlier, and a number of near misses. Beach-goer Thatchayiny Segar drowned at Camber in 2015. The RNLI also offered to provide lifeguards at Camber in 2009. Camber Sands had no lifeguard cover before the deaths of the seven men last summer Arumukam Saththiyanathan, the father of Ken and Kobi, said in a statement to the inquest that they had ""good swimming ability"" and their Sri Lankan village was surrounded by three big rivers. He said his sons swam in Sri Lanka almost every weekend before they came to the UK in July 2008. ""As a family, we went to the beaches in the UK nearly every summer and the boys went without us sometimes,"" he said. One of the fathers said it had been claimed the group were of Asian origin and not able to swim. Relatives also said they were disappointed Rother District Council had not taken up recommendations by the RNLI in 2009 and 2013 to provide lifeguards. They called for resignations at the authority, and said civil action had not been ruled out. In a statement, Dr Anthony Leonard, the Rother council's executive director of business operations, said: ""Our sympathies remain with the families, friends and communities of the seven people who tragically lost their lives last year. He said the deaths were different to the two previous incidents, which had involved non-swimmers paddling in shallow water, wearing non-swimming attire. ""Following an urgent review of the fatalities in 2016, we asked the RNLI to provide a full lifeguard service at Camber to give visitors reassurance and minimise the risks further. ""This service is now in place and our beach patrol works closely with the RNLI to deal with land-based incidents and educate visitors of the dangers of the sea. ""All measures put in place at Camber are kept under constant review."" Q&A: What happened at Camber Sands?

"HMP Whatton is one of the prisons used to hold and treat sex offenders The main sex offender treatment programme for England and Wales has been scrapped after a report found it led to more reoffending. Researchers found prisoners completing the programme were slightly more likely to offend than a control group. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) replaced the scheme in March after research confirmed evidence of its weaknesses. The main programme to psychologically treat the highest-risk offenders has also been replaced, the ministry said. Sex offenders freed without treatment Recorded sex crimes pass 100,000 a year The MOJ confirmed the change in treating sex offenders following publication on Friday of its own study which suggested the Core Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP) could be making the situation worse. The scheme, designed to challenge the behaviour of male sex offenders with psychological techniques to change their thinking, was first approved in 1992. Researchers followed what happened to 2,562 prisoners who took part in the 180 hours of group sessions before their later release from prison. They then compared their behaviour over the following years with more than 13,000 comparable offenders. ""More treated sex offenders committed at least one sexual re-offence [excluding breach of conditions of release] during the follow-up period when compared with the matched comparison offenders (10% compared with 8%),""said the study.,external ""More treated sex offenders committed at least one child image re-offence when compared with the matched comparison offenders (4.4% compared with 2.9 %). ""The results suggest that while Core SOTP in prisons is generally associated with little or no changes in sexual and non-sexual reoffending ... the small changes in the sexual reoffending rate suggest that either Core SOTP does not reduce sexual reoffending as it intends to do, or that the true impact of the programme was not detected. ""Group treatment may 'normalise' individuals' behaviour. When stories are shared, their behaviour may not be seen as wrong or different; or at worst, contacts and sources associated with sexual offending may be shared."" An earlier version of the scheme, in place in 2000, had appeared to reduce the offending of medium-risk men. But a study seven years later, after Core SOTP had been expanded, suggested the sessions had become too generic and based around a ""detailed manual"", rather than tailored to each offender. Sex offenders can receive therapy in prison and in the community Core programme devised in 1992 - but revised over years as evidence of effectiveness complex Main SOTP scheme rolled out to more prisons in 2000s - but now found to have failed Two new schemes have been accredited as replacements, having been devised from latest research The Ministry of Justice began to review the schemes in 2010 amid emerging evidence of what was working - and concerns about SOTP's effectiveness. On Friday it confirmed it had replaced Core SOTP in March  - a decision that was not announced at the time - and the extended version of the scheme for high-risk offenders in March. Offenders who would have originally taken part in those schemes were now on programmes called ""Horizon"" and ""Kaizen"". While the new schemes still involve group sessions, the inmates are no longer required to discuss their own offences. Horizon, aimed at medium-risk offenders, aims to teach them ""to manage unhealthy sexual thoughts and behaviours"" and make other positive changes to their lives. Kaizen, a Japanese word used in business to refer to continual improvements in performance, is focused on the highest risk offenders. ""We keep treatment programmes under constant review to reduce reoffending and protect the public,"" said the statement. ""The treatment of sex offenders is a complex issue, subject to international scrutiny and research. In the UK, we have been evaluating our Sex Offender Treatment Programmes since before 2003. ""We have discontinued two of the eight programmes and replaced them with new courses as part of this process. These new programmes will be monitored closely.""

"The proportion of UK residents' disposable income that goes into savings has fallen to a record low. The savings ratio - which measures the outgoings and incomings that affect households - has been falling sharply for more than a year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the ratio stood at 1.7% from January to March, down from 3.3% in the previous quarter. The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017,the ONS said,external. This was unchanged from an earlier estimate but confirmed the slowdown from the 0.7% rate seen in the final quarter of last year. Growth in the business services and finance sectors helped to offset slower consumer spending, the ONS said. Consumer spending and saving were hit by another fall in disposable income. For the first time since the 1970s, disposable income has fallen for three quarters in a row. Concernshave also been expressedabout the level of consumer borrowing on loans, credit cards, overdrafts and car finance. But the ONS also said that the timing of tax payments was a major factor in the cut in savings levels since September last year. Gross saving of Â£5.6bn in the first quarter of the year was a sharp drop from Â£11bn the previous quarter, and Â£17.7bn in the three months before that. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, said: ""The saving ratio has fallen again this quarter to a new record low, partly as a result of higher tax payments reducing disposable income. ""Some of the fall could be as a result of the timing of those payments, but the underlying trend is for a continued fall in the saving ratio."" Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ""These figures make for grim reading. People raiding their piggy banks is bad news for working people and the economy. ""But with wages falling as living costs rise, many families are having to run down their savings or rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. With household debt now at crisis levels, we urgently need to create better paid jobs."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""This suggests that the crisis in earnings not keeping up with prices means that many working households are struggling to make ends meet."" Vince Cable, from the Liberal Democrats, said: ""Rising prices and falling wages since the Brexit vote mean families are increasingly unable to live within their means or save for the future. ""Our economy's reliance on consumer spending, propped up by debt, is not sustainable and combined with an extreme Brexit the consequences could be severe."" Earlier this week, financial information serviceMoneyfacts saidthat savers have faced a ""never-ending battle"" to get a decent return on their cash over the past few years. Nine out of 10 easy access savings accounts pay interest of less than 1%, and a third of such accounts failed to even pay a rate matching the current base rate of 0.25%. Savings rates are failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living, with inflation at a rate of 2.9%.

"Martyn Hett's coffin has been covered in pictures of his idols, including several stars of Coronation Street Stars from Coronation Street were among hundreds who attended the funeral of one of the Manchester attack victims. Martyn Hett was one of 22 people who died when Salman Abedidetonated a homemade bombat an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Antony Cotton, Jennie McAlpine, Kym Marsh and Helen Worth all paid their respects to the 29-year-old Corrie fan. His family said the service at Stockport Town Hall was to ""celebrate Martyn's life"". This video can not be played Mariah Carey pays tribute to Manchester attack victim Martyn Hett They said he had requested two horses and a white carriage at his funeral, and that was what they gave him. The coffin was adorned with pictures of Corrie characters - including his favourite Deirdre Barlow, of whom he had a tattoo on his leg - and the Coronation Street sign. It was greeted by a minute's applause before it was taken into the building to the tune of Beautiful by Mariah Carey. This video can not be played Martyn Hett's life was 'a rollercoaster ride' Coronation Street stars Antony Cotton (left) and Jennie McAlpine (second right) attended the service Two horses and a white carriage carried Martyn to his funeral The coffin was carried by Martyn's brother Dan Hett (front left) Actors Kym Marsh and Helen Worth were among the mourners During the service, which was screened outside for those who could not fit into the venue, Martyn's father, Paul, told how the family's ""world was instantly turned upside down"" from the moment they were told their son was missing. He spoke of Martyn's life as ""one long rollercoaster ride"". He had a ""wicked sense of humour"" and a gift for ""turning the ordinary into the extraordinary"". The coffin was adorned with pictures of Coronation Street characters For a man who lived his life with such infectious joy, it seems fitting that his funeral should have been filled with such bittersweet celebration. At the time of Martyn's death, his partner Russell said he had ""left this world exactly how he lived, as the centre of attention"". Most people were dressed in the customary black but, as Martyn had asked, many added ""something fabulous"" to their outfits - including brightly-coloured flowers - in tribute to his own quirky style. As well as deeply sad words from Martyn's father, Paul, humorous videos were shown from Martyn's life, and there were affectionate anecdotes and music from his favourite stars. Gareth Clements, his boss at the PR firm he worked for, prompted raucous laughter as he told how Martyn was constantly lobbying for more money in the company's social budget, and was known to often attend the office wearing shorts. There were more smiles as Scottish singer Michelle McManus told how Martyn once travelled for 23 hours on a Megabus to see her perform. At times it was almost easy to forget why everyone was there. For those present, the brightest personality was taken away on the darkest of nights. The order of service for the funeral service During the day the hashtag#BeMoreMartyn,external- a tribute to him - started trending on Twitter,including one from his brother,external, Dan. Ross Purveswrote,external: ""We can all take a lesson from Martyn Hett: Be who you are, live life to the full and be fabulous! #bemoremartyn "" Another said,external: ""Fly free, you beautiful, iconic diva. #BemoreMartyn"" The service featured music from Martyn's favourite stars, including Scottish singer Michelle McManus, who spoke and sang at the service, and Ariana Grande.

"Seven people including five friends died at Camber last year The deaths of seven men who drowned at a beach last summer might still have happened even if there were lifeguards, a coroner has concluded. Two men died at Camber Sands, East Sussex in July, followed by five young friends a month later in August. Following a five-day inquest in Hastings, coroner Alan Craze ruled their deaths were through misadventure. Afterwards, the families of the five men said they believed lifeguards could have saved their lives. They said all five were competent swimmers but had been ""blamed for their own deaths"". The RNLI had precommended employing lifeguards previously. This video can not be played Kabinuja Srithavarajah's brother Gurushanth was among those who died Recording his conclusions, Mr Craze said: ""The RNLI had recommended, amongst other measures, deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but this had not happened. ""Of course, it is not known whether such a step would have prevented the deaths, but it has now been implemented."" Q&A: What happened at Camber Sands? Mr Craze said he would be sending off a prevention of future deaths letter with official figures highlighting his concerns, including those over the control of risk assessments. The inquest had heard that there was no legal requirement for Rother District Council to follow through with recommendations contained in risk assessments by the RNLI. Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer recorded a cause of death of immersion [drowning] for all five victims who died last August. Rother District Council offered its condolences to the families and said it did not ""want anyone else to have to suffer the tragedy of losing a loved one in these circumstances"". It said it had made improvements ""year on year"" at Camber in response to the risks identified. Live: More on this story and other news from Sussex Clockwise, from top left: Kenugen Saththiyanathan, Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Nitharsan Ravi, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, Silva Da Cruz, Mohit Dupar and Gurushanth Srithavarajah Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, died alongside his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both from Erith, south-east London. Their three friends who also died were Nitharsan Ravi, 22, from Plumstead, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, from Grays, Essex and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, from Welling. Two other people had also died there a month earlier. On 24 July, Mohit Dupar, 36, from Hayes, west London, attempted to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. This video can not be played The RNLI tells PM they want signs on beaches to be as informative as road traffic signs The inquest heard the five men were all fit, healthy and competent swimmers but were unaware of ""hidden dangers"". Oceanographer Dr Simon Boxall believed they got into trouble after heading out to a sandbar to play ball a significant distance out at sea, and then got into troubleamid a fast, incoming tideas they tried to head back to shore. He told the inquest there was insufficient wave activity to build up rip currents at the beach, but there would have been strong currents that would have had a significant impact even on a strong swimmer. Nine deaths occurred at Camber in the four years from 2012, including the seven last summer. There were no lifeguards on the beach prior to the seven deaths. Instead, the area was manned by beach patrol staff whose tasks included reuniting lost children with their parents and dealing with lost property. The inquest was told that in 2013 the RNLI had offered to deploy lifeguards following a risk assessment after the death of Tanzeela Ajmal, 31, a year earlier, and a number of near misses. Beach-goer Thatchayiny Segar drowned at Camber in 2015. The RNLI also offered to provide lifeguards at Camber in 2009. Camber Sands had no lifeguard cover before the deaths of the seven men last summer Arumukam Saththiyanathan, the father of Ken and Kobi, said in a statement to the inquest that they had ""good swimming ability"" and their Sri Lankan village was surrounded by three big rivers. He said his sons swam in Sri Lanka almost every weekend before they came to the UK in July 2008. ""As a family, we went to the beaches in the UK nearly every summer and the boys went without us sometimes,"" he said. One of the fathers said it had been claimed the group were of Asian origin and not able to swim. Relatives also said they were disappointed Rother District Council had not taken up recommendations by the RNLI in 2009 and 2013 to provide lifeguards. They called for resignations at the authority, and said civil action had not been ruled out. In a statement, Dr Anthony Leonard, the Rother council's executive director of business operations, said: ""Our sympathies remain with the families, friends and communities of the seven people who tragically lost their lives last year. He said the deaths were different to the two previous incidents, which had involved non-swimmers paddling in shallow water, wearing non-swimming attire. ""Following an urgent review of the fatalities in 2016, we asked the RNLI to provide a full lifeguard service at Camber to give visitors reassurance and minimise the risks further. ""This service is now in place and our beach patrol works closely with the RNLI to deal with land-based incidents and educate visitors of the dangers of the sea. ""All measures put in place at Camber are kept under constant review."" Q&A: What happened at Camber Sands?

"Ms Le Pen says the case is politically motivated French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been placed under formal investigation over an alleged European parliament funding scandal. The allegations were passed to French investigators who have opened a case. The parliament suspects some â¬5m (Â£4m; $5.4m) went to assistants of Ms Le Pen's National Front (FN) who were not working for MEPs but were actually engaged in FN party work in France. The National Front has denied the allegations. What will Le Pen do after her election defeat? In depth: Le Pen and the rise of the National Front Ms Le Pen, 48, has also denied any wrongdoing and has said the case is politically motivated. The alleged fraudulent payments - from 2012 onwards - concern her and several other FN MEPs. The allegations first arose on 27 April, ahead of the second round of voting in the French presidential election. Ms Le Pen was soundly beaten by Emmanuel Macron, by 66% to 34%. She later won a seat in the French parliament in legislative elections. What makes Marine Le Pen far right? Who's funding France's far right? Ms Le Pen had refused to answer questions on the matter during the campaign but said she would co-operate after the final round of presidential election voting. Her lawyer said she had been summoned by magistrates in Paris and ""as expected, placed under criminal investigation"". The FN has been highly critical of the EU, rejecting its free-market principles and open-border policies. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says most voters drawn to the FN are already highly suspicious of the EU, and may not see the alleged fraud as a particularly serious matter.

"Cpl Neilson (left) and Cpl Hatfield were described as ""exceptionally talented soldiers"" Two soldiers died after an explosion in a tank during an exercise at the Castlemartin firing range in Pembrokeshire, an inquest has heard. Corporals Matthew Hatfield and Darren Neilson from the Royal Tank Regimentdied after the blaston 14 June. The provisional cause of death for Cpl Hatfield was ""burns"", while Cpl Neilson suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of blast-related injuries, the Birmingham hearing was told. Two other soldiers were injured. One is still in a serious condition in hospital and the otherhas been discharged from hospital. A police-led joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive and a separate Ministry of Defence service inquiry are currently under way. Dyfed-Powys Police Det Ch Insp Ross Evans told Louise Hunt, senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, what happened after emergency services were called to an explosion on the range. He said it was thought Cpl Neilson, 31, of Preston, Lancashire, was the tank commander and ""we believe positioned within the turret"" at the time of the blast. Cpl Hatfield, 27, from Amesbury, Wiltshire, was the armoured vehicle's operator and was ""loading the ammunition in the tank"". He was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea, but thefather-of-one who was engaged to be married diedthe following day. His colleague, a married father with a young daughter, was taken to University Hospital Wales in Cardiff,but also died on June 15. Ms Hunt offered her condolences to the soldiers' families, who were present at the hearing, and told them a pre-inquest review would take place in February 2018. She said a full inquest lasting up to three weeks would be held in Solihull in July 2018. Releasing the bodies for funerals, she said: ""I do so, so arrangements can be made for you to have your funeral, because it's important you are able to start that process.""

"This video can not be played Nick Paget-Brown: ""I have to accept my share of responsibility"" Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Nick Paget-Brown has resigned following continued criticism of the council's handling of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Mr Paget-Brown faced calls to resign from London Mayor Sadiq Khan and a number of other senior politicians. It comes after an aborted meeting of the council's cabinet in which leaders had tried to ban members of the public and press. At least 80 people are believed to have died in the blaze on 14 June. Grenfell Tower: Cladding 'changed to cheaper version' What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? London fire: Six questions for the investigation London fire: A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Announcing his resignation, Mr Paget-Brown said he had to accept responsibility for ""perceived failings"" by the council after thetragedy.. ""I have therefore decided to step down as leader of the council as soon as a successor is in place,"" he said. Members of the public and press had been barred from the council meeting until a court order overturned the decision minutes before it was due to start Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is clearly a personal matter for the leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, as well as the council. ""However, given local people had lost confidence in the leader, it is right that he has stepped aside."" He said the government's priority ""remains focussed on the ongoing response efforts and providing all necessary support to those affected by this tragic incident"". Deputy council leader and cabinet member for housing, property and regeneration, Rock Feilding-Mellen, also announced his resignation. The decision to adjourn Thursday night's meeting led to a rebuke from Downing Street on Friday. A Number 10 spokesman said: ""The High Court ruled that the meeting should be open and we would have expected the council to respect that."" This video can not be played Council tries to ban press and public from meeting Council leaders claimed an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry. But angry protests followed and Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded the abandoned meeting a ""fiasco"". Mr Atkinson, the Labour group leader on Kensington and Chelsea, told the BBC he was ""ashamed"" of the authority. He accused leaders of ""hiding from residents, they have been hiding from backbench councillors for over a week"". Residents condemned the response to the tragedy calling it ""absolute chaos"" as relief efforts on the ground were limited. They said there was little or no co-ordination in the immediate days after the disaster with claims council officials were nowhere to be seen. It was accused of failing to provide enough support or information to those who had been made homeless. It tried to hold the first cabinet meeting since the disaster behind closed doors. After a High Court order ruled it should be open to the public, the council adjourned the meeting after 20 minutes claiming an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the inquiry. The London mayor demanded the resignation of the entire council leadership on Friday morning, adding the council's decision to scrap the meeting ""beggars belief"". Mr Khan welcomed Mr Paget-Brown stepping down, saying:  ""Ever since the awful events of two weeks ago, it has been clear that the local community in and around north Kensington has lost trust in the council and that the administration is not fit for purpose. ""Last night's decision to abandon the council's cabinet meeting has merely compounded the misery for local people who are grieving, traumatised and desperate for answers."" Mr Khan latertweeted a letter,externalhe sent to the prime minister, asking her to appoint commissioners to take over the running of the council until next May's council elections. The fire at the 24-storey block in North Kensington destroyed 151 homes, both in the tower and surrounding areas. Documents obtained by the BBCsuggest cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment was changed to a cheaper version, which was less fire resistant. Mr Paget-Brown said many ""questions about the cause of the fire and how it spread so quickly"" would need to be answered by the public inquiry. He added: ""The scale of this tragedy was always going to mean that one borough alone would never have sufficient resources to respond to all the needs of the survivors and those made homeless on its own. ""We have been very lucky to have the support of other London boroughs, the emergency services and community associations based in north Kensington and I'm very grateful to them."" Mr Paget-Brown said the council had been criticised for not answering ""all of the questions people had"". He said that was ""properly a matter for the public inquiry"". Deputy council leader Rock Feilding-Mellen has also resigned But he said his decision to accept legal advice that he ""should not compromise the public inquiry by having an open discussion in public"" on Thursday night had ""itself become a political story"". ""It cannot be right that this should have become the focus of attention when so many are dead or still unaccounted for,"" he added. Announcing his resignation, Mr Feilding-Mellen said it had been suggested several times since the blaze that he should step down but he had felt it was his ""duty"" to back the council's efforts to help the victims. ""It will be for others to judge whether it would have been better for me to resign immediately, but I would have found it hard to forgive myself if I had ducked out at such a moment of crisis for the borough,"" he said. Cladding on at least 149 high-rise buildings across 45 local authority areas in England hasfailed fire safety tests. Last weekend, Camden Borough Council evacuated five tower blocks which were found to have the same flammable cladding as that of Grenfell Tower.

"Cladding fitted to Grenfell Tower during its refurbishment was changed to a cheaper version, documents obtained by the BBC suggest. Documents show the zinc cladding originally proposed was replaced with an aluminium type, which was less fire resistant, saving nearly Â£300,000. The cladding is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire that killed at least 80 people. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Councilhas stepped down. Nicholas Paget-Brown said he accepted ""responsibility for these perceived failings in particular my decision to accept legal advice"" over the council's first cabinet meeting since the disaster. On Thursday,it adjourned its meeting after 20 minutesafter it was forced by a court order to admit the press and public. Why don't we know how many died? Judge 'doubt' over inquiry scope Who were the victims? The council halted the meeting, claiming it would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry. However, Downing Street has criticised the council, saying the High Court had ruled the meeting should be open to the public. ""We would have expected the council to respect that,"" a spokesman added. Meanwhile, the head of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation has stepped aside so he can focus on ""assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". The company, which manages Grenfell Tower on behalf of the council, said it will appoint an interim chief executive to replace Robert Black. This video can not be played There were angry scenes when members of the council's cabinet walked out of the meeting The documents obtained by the BBC reveal contractors working for Kensington and Chelsea council were asked in 2014 to replace zinc cladding with a more economical aluminium version. One document - a list of requested savings sent to contractors in July 2014 - details potential savings of Â£693,161, reducing the cost of the contract from about Â£9.2m to Â£8.5m. It includes Â£293,368 that would be saved by fitting ""aluminium cladding in lieu of zinc cladding"". The switch allowed for a change of colour, but the BBC has been told another key reason was to save money. The leaked documents estimated the cladding changes would save Â£293,368 Documents seen bythe Times newspaper,external, reportedly show that, days earlier, the local management organisation had sent an ""urgent nudge email"" to the construction consultants involved in the refurbishment. It says the email urged them to provide ""good costs"" on cladding that could be shown to the councillor overseeing the work. Earlier planning documents suggest the original plan was for zinc cladding with a fire-retardant core. Residents had also been told their new cladding would be made of zinc. Despite their differences, both types of cladding have the same official fire rating. Police investigating the disaster have said the tower's cladding has subsequently failed safety tests. The savings were part of an ongoing effort by the council and the local tenant management organisation to drive down the cost of the refurbishment. This video can not be played Lord Porter tells Radio 4 Today that the government has not re-tested high-rise buildings ""properly"" A source close to one of the many companies involved in the project said the change was typical of constant pressure by councils to reduce the costs of building refurbishments. Council minutes from 2013 show dissatisfaction with the initially-preferred contractor for not keeping the scheme within budget. Further bids were invited, and this led to the appointment of a different contractor in 2014 which was then asked to make savings including on the cladding. Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council has promised to co-operate fully with all investigations into the fire. Tests are being carried out on 600 buildings around the country following the fire on 14 June. On Friday, Downing Street said cladding from 149 tower blocks in 45 local authority areas had failed fire safety tests. Every panel tested had failed combustibility tests, it added. An expert panel set up in the wake of the fire said cladding that has failed safety tests may still be allowed to stay attached to high-rise blocks. The Independent Advisory Panel said it would ask experts whether the material could stay on a building ""under certain approved circumstances"". Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister saying the inquiry should be broadened as the disaster ""has much wider implications"" on a national scale. The Labour leader called upon Theresa May to make a commitment to ensure Grenfell residents ""are as fully involved as possible as the inquiry progresses"". âºWhat happened at Grenfell Tower? Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said fire safety tests on cladding from high-rise buildings were flawed. He criticised the tests for focusing on the core of the panel - rather than the panel as a whole. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""isn't the right thing to test"", adding: ""The government needs to listen to a wider set of opinions and not just the experts they have got."" Number 10 said the government was urging councils to carry out their own safety checks and to put mitigation measures in place where there are concerns. Meanwhile, the Sports Ground Safety Authority (SGSA), which monitors safety conditions at Premier League and Football League grounds, has written to football clubs across the country to ask them to check on any external cladding on stadiums.

"This video can not be played Trump's tweets: Four women, two takes Two TV presenters attacked on Twitter by President Donald Trump have accused him of lying and suggested the White House tried to blackmail them. The hosts of MSNBC Morning Joe said they were warned a tabloid would run a negative story on them unless they said sorry for their coverage of Mr Trump. Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough said Mr Trump's tweets were ""vicious"" and ""frightening"". The president called them ""low IQ crazy Mika"" and ""Psycho Joe"" on Thursday. He also referred to Ms Brzezinski as ""bleeding badly from a facelift"". The couple, who are engaged to be married, wrote a joint response in Friday'sWashington Post,externalaccusing the president of an ""unhealthy obsession"" with them. National Enquirer: Trump's mouthpiece? What started yesterday as an undignified personal spat between Donald Trump and the hosts of a cable news show has morphed into something much more sinister - allegations of White House machinations that tread ever so close to outright blackmail. If what Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough say is true, they were the targets of political dark arts reminiscent of the schemes of the Watergate ""fixers"" during the Nixon White House. Could Trump aides have really used the threat of an embarrassing story in a tabloid newspaper to pressure the two hosts to provide more favourable coverage? The Trump administration will surely deny the charges, although the president himself lent some corroboration by tweeting that Scarborough asked him to tell the National Enquirer to bury an article about him. That the president said he rejected such a request only raises more questions about the editorial control Mr Trump may have over a newspaper that routinely targeted his political opponents in 2016. Where this story goes from here is anyone's guess. Chances are, however, that the president - via his unchecked Twitter megaphone - will only add fuel to the fire. Co-presenters Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were both targets of Donald Trump's Twitter tirade They denied his claims they had spent three nights at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last New Year's Eve and that they had ""insisted"" on spending time with him. Instead they said they turned down his invitation to attend his festive party. They continued: ""Putting aside Mr Trump's never-ending obsession with women's blood, Mika and her face were perfectly intact, as pictures from that night reveal."" On their morning show, Ms Brzezinski denied having had a face-lift, saying she had a procedure to get the skin under her chin ""tweaked"". Does Trump's latest tweet storm matter? This video can not be played Chaos erupts in the Oval Office The TV presenters also said three White House officials had told them the National Enquirer would publish a negative article about them unless they apologised to Mr Trump for their scrutiny of him. Mr Scarborough said: ""They said, 'if you call the president up and you apologise for your coverage then he'll pick up the phone and basically spike the story.'"" ""I had, I will just say, three people at the very top of the administration calling me."" Ms Brzezinski said reporters from the supermarket tabloid began harassing her family. ""They were calling my children,"" she said. ""They were calling close friends. ""These calls persisted for quite some time and then Joe had the conversations that he had with the White House where they said 'oh, this could go away'."" David Pecker, chief executive of the Enquirer's parent company, is a staunch ally of Mr Trump, which is reflected in the tabloid's coverage of the president. But in a Friday morning tweet, Mr Trump denied the couple's claims, saying Mr Scarborough ""called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no!"" This video can not be played The MSNBC hosts say the White House demanded an apology for coverage, or the National Enquirer would run a story on them Mr Scarborough swiftly hit back: ""Yet another lie. I have texts from your top aides and phone records. Also, those records show I haven't spoken with you in many months."" Mr Scarborough also said that a ""well-known congressman"" had told him that the president went on a ""rant"" against the show during a meeting with around 20 legislators at the White House to discuss efforts to pass healthcare legislation. ""I've been in politics my whole life. â¦ He scared me,"" Mr Scarborough said, describing what the source had told him. ""Because he was vicious when he turned from you to Mika,"" he described being told. ""His face was red. He started talking about blood coming out of her ears, out of her eyes."" Democrats held a news conference condemning President Trump's tweets The Enquirer's owner said on Friday morning the tabloid had published a story at the beginning of June about the couple's relationship ""the truth of which is not in dispute"". Dylan Howard, vice-president of the publication's parent company, added in the statement: ""We have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions."" The Enquirer's Twitter account retweeted their article on Friday, with a headline about ""Morning Joe Couple's Sleazy Cheating Scandal!"" Mr Trump's original tweet about the MSNBC hosts provoked a storm of criticism, including even from some fellow Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Trump's remarks on Thursday were ""beneath the office"" of president. ""Please just stop. This isn't normal,"" tweeted fellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse. The Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Mr Trump's tweets ""sexist, an assault on the freedom of the press & an insult to all women"". The White House sprang to Mr Trump's defence. ""I don't think that the president has ever been someone that gets attacked and doesn't push back,"" spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News. In a previous spat withjournalist Megyn Kelly,Mr Trump referred to ""blood coming out of her wherever"", implying her work was being affected by her menstrual cycle. The Morning Joe co-presenters have increasingly attacked President Trump since he took office. In recent weeks, Mr Scarborough has called him a ""bumbling dope"", while Ms Brzezinski has called him ""phony"", a ""narcissist"" and accused him of ""destroying the country"". Ms Brzezinski is the daughter of the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, while Mr Scarborough is a former Republican congressman.

"US tennis star Venus Williams has been involved in a car crash that led to the death of a 78-year-old man. A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion. A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said. Police believe she was at fault but her lawyer says it was an accident. She has not been cited or charged. The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the collision happened. Ms Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media. Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived. ""[Ms Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver],"" the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions. The 37-year-old, seven-time Grand Slam champion reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly. Ms Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: ""Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her. ""Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one."" Next week, Ms Williams is due to play her 20th Wimbledon tournament in London, where she is seeded 10th. Ms Williams and her sister Serena have dominated the women's game for two decades.

"Sir Paul McCartney and Sony have a reached a deal in a battle over who owns publishing rights to The Beatles' songs,The Hollywood Reporter,externalsays. The musician had gone to a US court, seeking to regain the rights to 267 of the band's classic tracks. He has been trying to get them back since the 1980s, when Michael Jackson famously out-bid him for the rights. Jackson's debt-ridden estatesold the songs to Sony last year, along with others including New York, New York. Sir Paul's legal case, filed in a Manhattan court in January, was over what is known as copyright termination - the right of authors to reclaim ownership of their works from music publishers after a specific length of time has passed. He claimed that he was set to reacquire the Beatles songs in 2018, but said Sony had not confirmed that it would transfer the copyrights to him.

"This video can not be played ""This time we knew what to expect"" - immigration lawyer at San Francisco airport People from six mainly Muslim countries and all refugees now face tougher US entry due to President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban. It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry. Lawyers took up positions at US airports, offering free advice. But there was no sign of the chaos that affected travellers when the first version of the ban was brought in at a few hours' notice in January. That is because the executive order does not affect people who already have valid visas or green cards. The Department of Homeland Security said it expected ""business as usual at our ports of entry"". Seven questions about the ban Monday's Supreme Court ruling upheld the temporary ban, a key Trump policy. But the judges provided a major exception, for those who have ""a credible claim of a bona fide relationship"" with someone in the US. The effect is that citizens of the affected countries with a close relative in the US, such as a spouse, parent, child or sibling, will potentially be allowed in. In a last minute change, the Trump administration extended the definition of close family to include fiancÃ©s. However grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces are not considered to be ""bona fide"" relations. 'Grandparents, not terrorists' The rules apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, as well as to all refugees. Travellers with family connections in the US - such as this Yemeni mother - will not be affected by the revised order Moments before the ban began at 20:00 Washington time on Thursday (00:00 GMT), it emerged that the state of Hawaii had asked a federal judge for clarification. Hawaii's attorney general has argued that the definition of ""close family"" is too narrow and may improperly prevent people from travelling to the US. Big win for Trump and his travel ban The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would be closely monitoring the guidance and implementation of the order. The Supreme Court is expected to make a final decision on the ban when its next session begins in October. Travel ban protests took place in New York as the ban took effect According to the new rules, for the next 90 days those from the six countries without a close relationship will not be able to enter the US. IN- a parent, spouse, fiancÃ©, child, son- or daughter-in-law, or sibling, including step- or half-siblings. OUT- grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, extended family and grandchildren. Also exempt from the new rules are those with business or educational ties to the US. However, the guidelines specifically state that the relationship must be formal, documented and not formed for the purpose of evading the order. As well as making clear that those with valid visas and legal permanent residents are not affected,the Department of Homeland Security says,externaldual nationals who travel on their passport from the unaffected country will also be allowed entry. The Supreme Court also approved a 120-day ban on refugees entering the US, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who cannot prove the same ties to an American individual or entity. But opponents of the ban point out that refugees are invited to relocate in the US by the UN Refugee Agency, which has well-documented relationships with the people they refer for resettlement. It remains unclear how many refugees scheduled to resettle in the US will be affected, but the government will fully halt the programme once its quota of 50,000 refugees for the budget year ending in September is met. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: ""I don't belong here"" The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security and pointed to terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin as evidence. However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and said that this ban would not have stopped atrocities in the US perpetrated by American-born attackers. The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports. It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria. The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems. The policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland. Trump travel ban: Who counts as family?

"About 150 people from all backgrounds and walks of life strutted their stuff Four-day-old James is carried along the catwalk to meet the world for the first time. Ninety-nine-year-old Mickie, who drove army trucks during World War Two, makes her way up the runway with a walking stick. Stefan, the bearded The Big Issue North seller from Manchester Victoria station, slowly twirls and waves as he goes. Helen, who's had cancer and a drink problem, pauses at the end, tilting her head to look to the sky. This is no ordinary catwalk, and these aren't ordinary models. They're real people who are walking a catwalk in the middle of Manchester to create a live ""self-portrait of the city"" - an idea dreamed up by artist Jeremy Deller. It's a simple idea. A platform that normally celebrates superficial appearance is instead used to celebrate the everyday brilliance and resilience of the people of the city. And it's more beautiful than any fashion show. Beautiful, heartwarming and life-affirming. About 150 people walk the 100m yellow runway while the gathered crowds - maybe a couple of thousand - read snippets about their life stories on the screens. There's Chris, who's been in Strangeways prison. He's beaming with a fist in the air like a rock star. There's Kate, who was christened Andrew; trainee doctor Sermed; Wajid, who's had a kidney transplant; Vincenzo, who cleans the town hall; Jehona, who saw 19 members of her family killed in Kosovo and was herself left for dead. There are two taxi drivers who turned their meters off to give stranded Ariana Grande fans free lifts home on the night of the Manchester Arena attack. There's Bruce, who waits at the end of the catwalk for his blind date. A few minutes later, Frankie emerges, and they smile broadly and embrace in the middle before departing for their date. It could be the start of something special. As each new person is applauded - literally - for being themselves, whatever form that takes, this joyful parade becomes surprisingly moving. New Order meets hip-hop: Manchester music reinvents itself Searching for the soul of England's men Manchester International Festival on the BBC While this alternative catwalk show was planned long before last month's Manchester Arena attack, that incident - and the emotions it stirred - make this more potent. Titled What Is The City But The People?, it's the opening event of the Manchester International Festival, the city's biennial arts festival. Lots of people here probably wouldn't think of 150 men, woman and children (and some dogs) walking up and down a walkway as art. But it took an artist and an arts festival to make it happen. And it's often only artists who have the licence to make us stop, see things we hadn't spotted before, and hit us where we feel it most. The simplicity and beauty of this event puts Jeremy Deller up there as the king of great ideas that reach into our lives and touch us. He's the man behind the acid house brass band, the re-enactment of the Battle of Orgreave, the bouncy Stonehenge and the Manchester Procession, a previous parade that featured tribes like smokers, ramblers, buskers and Big Issue Sellers. The idea for the catwalk event came from Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller Perhaps his greatest stroke was the poignant 2016 Battle of the Somme commemoration project that sawactors dressed as ghostly World War One soldiers turn up in towns and cities across the UK. With respect to David Hockney, Grayson Perry and Banksy, Deller might be Britain's best living artist. His Procession was part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival. Since then, there's been criticism that the festival has been too much about the international artists who land every two years and not enough about Manchester. What Is The City But The People?was a clear attempt by the new artistic director John McGrath to reconnect the festival with the city. While the crowd was a small fraction of Manchester's population, it succeeded. It will make people pause to think more about those they encounter on the city's streets. About the stories beneath the surface. That they are all real people. More cities should have a catwalk like it.

"Parents should be banned from leaving the car running while waiting outside school gates, to cut air pollution, according to official health guidance. The guidance also calls for councils to set up clean-air zones that could ban the most polluting vehicles or introduce charges. The authors have called for ""clean air"" to be given the same importance as ""clean water"". Air pollution contributes to 29,000 deaths each year in the UK. The report is by two government bodies - Public Health England (PHE) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). How bad is air pollution in the UK? Bid to delay air pollution plan fails Government air pollution plan 'unfair' Prof Paul Cosford, from PHE, said the report was the ""distillation of best evidence"" on tackling air pollution that local councils could implement. He said cars going nowhere with the engine on ""annoy me - I just think why are you sitting there with your car idling?"" ""No-idling zones raise awareness in all our minds that 'Come on, we don't need to be polluting,' he said. ""It's totemic."" The report says the zones should be introduced outside schools, hospitals and care homes - to protect those most vulnerable from the fumes. London's Westminster Council already has marshals handing out Â£80 finesto car idlers,external. Other recommendations include: clean air zones with charges for polluting cars congestion charges promoting smooth driving by removing speed bumps and setting more 20mph (32km/h) speed limits promoting electric cars, with more charging points in public places training bus drivers in fuel-efficient driving making it easy for people to walk and cycle changing town planning to prevent homes and schools being in areas of high pollution The UK has struggled to keep within EU limits on pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) - with 37 of the 43 regions of the UK in breach of NO2 limits. But the report says policies should be aiming to go much further than meeting legal limits. Prof Cosford told BBC News: ""The best estimate is 29,000 deaths in the UK [from air pollution], then why would we only want to reduce that to the legal amount? ""We want to reduce that to as close to zero as we can. ""We have developed clean water, and clean air is a basic issue of human health."" The report from health officials comes as the UK government is about to be taken to court again over its plans for tackling air pollution. Its draft planhas been dismissed as ""toothless"" and ""weak"" by critics. James Thornton, the chief executive of ClientEarth, said: ""It's hugely significant that public health experts are raising the prospect of clean air zones, which could charge the dirtiest vehicles to enter the most polluted areas of our towns and cities. ""The government's own evidence shows this is the most effective way to bring down illegal and harmful levels of air pollution as soon as possible, which ministers are legally bound to do. ""So it's astounding that the government did not make this clear to people when it consulted on its air quality plans for the UK, forcing us to go back to the High Court next Wednesday to try to get them to do this. ""If this is going to happen, then people need to have their say on it."" Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""Air pollution is poisonous. ""We welcome the recommendations to introduce no-vehicle- idling areas, [and] clean air zones in the most polluted towns and cities will be vital in reducing toxic emissions and protecting us all.""

"This video can not be played Outside parliament there were celebrations as the measure was passed A clear majority of German MPs have voted to legalise same-sex marriage, days after Chancellor Angela Merkel dropped her opposition to a vote. The reform grants couples now limited to civil unions full marital rights, and allows them to adopt children. Mrs Merkel's political opponents were strongly in favour. But the chancellor, who signalled her backing for a free vote only on Monday, voted against. The bill was backed by 393 lawmakers, 226 voted against and four abstained. The German legal code will now read: ""Marriage is entered into for life by two people of different or the same sex"", AFP news agency reported. Following Friday's vote, Mrs Merkel said that for her marriage was between a man and a woman. But she said she hoped the passing of the bill would lead to more ""social cohesion and peace"". During her 2013 election campaign, Mrs Merkel argued against gay marriage on the grounds of ""children's welfare,"" and admitted that she had a ""hard time"" with the issue. Outside parliament there were celebrations as the measure was passed on the last day before it dissolves for summer recess But in an on-stage interview with the women's magazine Brigitte on 26 June, she shocked the German media by saying, in response to an audience member's question, that she had noted other parties' support for gay marriage, and would allow a free vote at an unspecified time in the future. Mrs Merkel has changed her stance on same-sex adoption - but nonetheless voted to oppose gay marriage The usually-cautious chancellor said she had had a ""life-changing experience"" in her home constituency, where she met a lesbian couple who cared for eight foster children together. As the news spread on Twitter, supporters rallied under the hashtag #EheFuerAlle (MarriageForAll) - and started calling for a vote as soon as possible. 'Now my brother can marry his boyfriend' Mrs Merkel's current coalition partners - the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are trailing Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) in opinion polls - then seized the political initiative. They called for a vote by the time parliament went into summer recess at the end of the week - prompting Mrs Merkel to complain she'd been ""ambushed"". Yes - a recent survey by the government's anti-discrimination agency found that 83% of Germans were in favour of marriage equality. The day after the Republic of Irelandvoted to legalise gay marriage in May 2015, almost every German newspaper splashed a rainbow across its front page. ""It's time, Mrs Merkel"" Green party leader Katrin Goering-Eckhart said then. ""The Merkel faction cannot just sit out the debate on marriage for everyone."" Angela Merkel voted against legalising same sex marriage. Nevertheless, she'll go down in history as the chancellor who made it possible. Friday marks a historic victory for the political left who've fought for years to bring the bill before parliament. The bill is one of the very last measures to come through parliament before the September general election. By voting against it, Mrs Merkel has appealed to the more conservative members of her electorate. But, by allowing it to happen, she's cemented her growing reputation as a defender of liberal values and, perhaps more importantly, seen off an issue which might have come to haunt her later on. If Mrs Merkel wins a majority in September, she's likely to seek coalition with parties who'd already indicated that same sex marriage legislation would have been a condition of partnership. Because of an upcoming general election. Germans go to the polls on 24 September, and continued opposition to a vote made Mrs Merkel risk looking anachronistic. Mrs Merkel's coalition partners, the SPD, had ruled out a future coalition deal unless reform was agreed on. The Greens, the far-left Linke, and the pro-business Free Democrats took the same view. The Greens have strongly support gay marriage and deputy Volker Beck joined the celebrations The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the only party to oppose same-sex marriage. But conservatives within Mrs Merkel's own CDU were against a change - as was the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), whose votes Mrs Merkel needs in the September election. Commentators say this partly explains why she has rejected a vote on marriage equality until now - and why she was taken off-guard by the snap vote. A host of European countries have beaten Germany to a same-sex marriage law. Civil marriages are legally recognised in Norway, Sweden, Denmark (excluding the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, France, the UK (except Northern Ireland and Jersey), and the Republic of Ireland. But in Austria and Italy - as in Germany before Friday's vote- gay couples are restricted to civil partnerships. Celebrations as Germany legalises gay marriage.

"If Sir Vince Cable becomes Lib Dem leader - and he faces no challengers at the moment - we will have the oldest line-up of party leaders in the Commons since the 1950s. Has British politics finally got over its obsession with youth? Politics is one of the few fields where being in your 40s is seen as being young. When Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997 at the age of 43, much was made of the fact that he was the youngest occupant of Downing Street since 1812. The first opposition leader he faced, William Hague, was even younger, at 36. And he wore a baseball cap to prove it, which, on reflection, was probably a mistake. When Charles Kennedy took over as Lib Dem leader in 1999, at the age of 39, it was the youngest line-up of leaders the Commons had ever seen. Two decades later and leadership has skipped a generation upwards. Sir Vince is 74, Theresa May is 60 and Jeremy Corbyn 68. Tony Blair was the youngest prime minister since 1812 As Channel 4's Michael Crick has pointed out, this is the oldest collection of party leaders the Commons has seen since April 1955, when 80-year-old Sir Winston Churchill was prime minister, up against Labour leader Clement Attlee, 72, and 71-year-old Liberal leader Clement Davis. Churchill and Attlee were political giants, but they were in the twilight of their careers and, in Churchill's case, in poor health. Both were under constant pressure to stand aside for younger men. But the idea that political leaders should always be vigorous go-getters, open to new ideas and the latest trends, ideally with a camera-ready wife and children, did not really take off until the decade that followed, when being young was suddenly all that seemed to matter. Youngest UK party leader and prime minister:William Pitt, the Younger, a Whig who was regarded as a Tory by opponents, became prime minister in 1783 at the age of 24 Oldest UK party leader and prime minister:Liberal Party leader William Gladstone, pictured, resigned in 1894 at the age of 84. Sir Winston Churchill was 80 when he retired as prime minister and Conservative leader in 1955 Oldest US president:At 70, Donald Trump is the oldest person to enter office. Ronald Reagan, who was 77 when his presidency ended in 1989, was the oldest person to hold the office Youngest US president:Theodore Roosevelt, who became president at the age of 42 after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901, was the youngest person to assume the office. John F Kennedy remains the youngest person, at 43, to be elected to the White House The catalyst was Harold Wilson, who was 47 when he became Labour leader in 1963. The pipe smoking, avuncular character in a grey raincoat was sold to the public as a youthful, dynamic breath of fresh air. Not as glamorous, perhaps, as the then US president John F Kennedy, who was just a year younger than Wilson, but certainly a lot younger, and more in touch with the modern world, than 70-year-old Tory leader Harold Macmillan. It is a short step from Wilson chumming around with The Beatles at the Variety Club awards in 1964 to Tony Blair hosting Noel Gallagher at Number 10. Harold Wilson courts the youth vote at the Variety Club awards in 1964 Being young and hip, or being able to stand next to someone who is young and hip without making a complete fool of yourself, had become a key attribute for aspiring political leaders. Like his friend and political soul-mate Bill Clinton, Tony Blair was self-consciously youthful in a way that will be instantly familiar to embarrassed teenagers everywhere. He was even pictured walking into Downing Street with an electric guitar. And although prejudices against female and ethnic minority politicians began to crumble during the Blair-Clinton years, ageism lingered on. Political leaders appeared to come with a self-imposed sell-by-date. ""At the time of the next election, I'll be 67 or 68 and I believe that is simply too old to lead a party into government,"" said Michael Howard in 2005, as he claimed the then 64-year-old Ken Clarke was too old to succeed him as Conservative leader. Mr Howard's 39-year-old protege, David Cameron, fitted the youthful bill, and earned bragging rights in the Commons when he told the no-longer-quite-so-youthful Tony Blair: ""You were the future once."" He even broke Tony Blair's youngest prime minister record by a few weeks. Bernie Sanders is a hit with young political activists But can you have too much of a good (or bad, depending on your point of view) thing? Smooth, identikit politicians such as Mr Cameron, his coalition partner, Nick Clegg, and their Labour opponent at the 2015 election, Ed Miliband, were all in their 40s with young children. The stage was set for a grizzled veteran, even if he did not realise it at the time. ""At my age I'm not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?""Jeremy Corbyn told the Guardian,external, after surprising himself, and everyone else, by getting on to the Labour leadership ballot in 2015. The wild enthusiasm among young left-wing activists for Mr Corbyn gave the lie to the idea - long-held by broadcasters as well as politicians - that the under-30s could relate only to people their own age. Across the Atlantic, Bernie Sanders, the 75-year-old senator who lost out to 69-year-old Hillary Clinton in the battle for the Democratic nomination, is another example of a pensioner who commands crowds of adoring millennials. In the social-media age, authenticity can be prized above all else - and, whatever you think about their politics, Mr Corbyn and Mr Sanders are unspun figures who are comfortable in their own skins. Age and experience are, arguably, part of their appeal. Donald Trump is the oldest elected US president Age was not a barrier to success for Donald Trump either, who, at 70, is America's oldest elected president, beating previous record-holder Ronald Reagan by a year. Which brings us back to Sir Vince Cable, who prefers to compare himself to Churchill and William Gladstone, who became prime minister at 82, than the current occupant of the White House, but who has also faced questions over his advancing years. There weremutterings about the party going from ""dad to grandad"",externalwhen he announced his intention to stand. The former business secretary, who won back his Twickenham seat at the general election, was having none of it. ""Some of the brightest and most interesting people in British politics recently have been relatively old. You remember Bernie Sanders in America as well? I don't feel old, I feel young and energetic, and I'm very much up for a contest."" Sir Vince has always regretted not standing for the party leadership in 2007, when Sir Menzies Campbell was effectively hounded out of the job for being too old, at what these days might be described as the youthful age of 66. Sir Vince, who was then 64, apparently feared that he would also be judged too old. But now, 10 years older, and with the forty-something generation of leaders having departed the stage, that no longer seems to be an issue.

"Emma Watson and Reese Witherspoon love to show their bookworm credentials on Instagram Celebrity book clubs are becoming increasingly popular, but is this a great thing for reading or just another vanity exercise? Old hands at the book club game are husband and wife team Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan and Oprah. Their clubs began on TV but the new breed has, from the off, been virtual - online and on apps. And the main players are almost exclusively female, including Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Florence Welch, Zoella and Sarah Jessica Parker, as are the clubs' members. It would be easy to be cynical about this new trend but it has its merits, says Claire Armitstead, associate editor for culture at the Guardian. The Richard and Judy Book Club puts out three seasonal selections ""These celebrities want to show they are intelligent people and not just celebrities, that's perhaps their motive for it. ""But what they bring is their brand. There are so many books in the world that any kind of 'sorting hat', to use a Harry Potter term, is a good thing for reading.""

Caz Frear's first novel has just gone on sale and she's working on her next story ""It was the possibility of their validation, they are huge names in the literary world. You think, if they like it then I must have something. There were other competitions that weren't small fry but I wanted to put myself in the strongest position."" The Richard and Judy club has grown into a polished brandin collaboration with high-street chain WH Smith,externalsince starting on the couple's Channel 4 chat show in the early 2000s. Now only online (and in stores), it is more successful, says Madeley. ""I knew it would be fine, we are a brand and, in fact, we're selling more books than before... the internet is king."" Books are submitted for consideration by publishers, which inevitably leads to recurring well-known names. But the final selections - issued three times a year - are made on quality alone, says Madelely. ""We choose a lot of established names, yes, but it's entirely on merit. We love finding new talent like Caz... you need fresh blood all the time... books are the stuff of life."" If he and Finnigan keep an eye on the new celebrity clubs, it's from an interested, not competitive, stance. ""We're all out there to get people reading,"" says Madeley. Emma Watson left books for people to find on the New York and London tube networks A recent survey by The Reading Agencyshowed two thirds of people would like to read more but are too busy. Yet, the agency's chief executive supports Armitstead's ""sorting hat"" theory: ""Most people also said they struggled to find a book they liked. Recommendations are the most likely thing to convince people to read more literature... however they are signposted to books, it can only be a good thing,"" says Sue Wilkinson. Harry Potter star Emma Watson points her followers towards powerful feminist literature through her clubOur Shared Shelf (OSS),externalon the Good Reads website. She is also active onInstagram,external. Watson launched OSS in 2016 following her appointment as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador andher HeForShe speech. Every two months she selects a book for her 193,000-plus members to absorb and discuss. Emma Watson's mission statement on Good Reads Selections have included Gloria Steinem's My Life on the Road and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale - now enjoying renewed interest possibly due to a heady combination of a Channel 4 dramatisation, Watson's endorsement and the topicality of its issues. Watson's enterprise is clearly serious and she's left books for others to find on the London and New York undergrounds. ""Emma Watson with her feminist classics is placing herself as a young thinking woman but doing it through her position as a UN ambassador is quite structured,"" says Armitstead. ""Similarly, if someone wants to project themselves as a fun person they are going to choose fun books. ""Emma Watson will have people advising her, probably in order to push the kind of books the organisation thinks people should be reading. ""It is a good thing for a woman to read Gloria Steinem but has Emma Watson?"" Florence Welch's book club was set up by fans in honour of her love of literature Relaxed and seemingly without agenda is Florence Welch'sBetween Two Books on Twitter,external.  Herfan website,externalalso promotes the club. It was established by Welch enthusiasts in dedication of her love of reading, demonstrated in her regular online posts about books. She got involved at their invitation. Welch suggests a wide range of literature, from Eimear McBride's The Lesser Bohemian to the poetry of Ted Hughes. She also involves her music mates, so that Nick Cave and Bat for Lashes have flagged up choices. Welch dips in and out of the 11,000-plus members' discussions and even offers the chance to meet her, authors and each other at book events such as theBorris Festival,external. Unlike some other clubs which are more inclined towards just showcasing the star's reading, Watson and Welch's are clubs in the traditional sense. They allow like-minded people ""to get together"" (literally in Welch's case) and talk. And the fans love it. ""The club (Between Two Books) is for fans and managed by fans, ordinary, lovely and like-minded people,"" says one ardent fan, Kawanna Pena Cepeda, from the Dominican Republic. ""It makes it more approachable and grounded. It doesn't have any 'agenda'... other than share amazing literature that our queen, Florence, loves. ""It's an amazing way to connect with other Flo fans other than by her music. It's exciting to think the book you are currently reading, Florence is reading as well... it feels like we are connected."" Similarly, Maritza Jimenez in Chicago, Illinois says she joined OSS ""because I really admire Emma Watson"". ""To have that instant connection (however small) feels really good. Then, I put some serious thought into what she's trying to do... open up a discussion on women's issues... it's a complex topic to tackle because it is a very human issue."" Jessica Knoll's novel was chosen by Reese Witherspoon Authors and the book industry are also reaping benefits from this endorsement. ""Steinem's My Life on the Road, Emma Watson's first title, had a 200% boost week on week in the UK for the second week of January 2016, from 138 copies to 415,"" says Lisa Campbell of theBookseller,external. And a true powerhouse in driving author interest, and sales is Reese Witherspoon.  The actress has become ""a champion of female fiction writers"", says Isabelle Broom, book reviews editor at Heat magazine. Her book club is on Instagram,external, with 71,000-plus followers. She also talks books onTwitter,external. And, she has an eye for a story which is prime for movie adaptation and is quick to buy the rights through her production company, such as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. Broom describes the actress as a ""positive force of good"" and authors are effusive too, among them Jessica Knoll, writer of Luckiest Girl Alive. ""[Witherspoon's] support has immensely boosted Luckiest Girl Alive's visibility and sales,"" says Knoll. ""It was featured in a lot of traditional media and that definitely had a cumulative impact, but when Reese featured my book... I noticed an immediate and enormous uptick in my Amazon ranking. Zoella has just launched her new batch of recommended reads TheZoella Book Club,external, also supported by WH Smith and just relaunched for 2017, has also had industry impact - and on teenage girls. With a recent National Literacy Trust study suggestingreading for pleasure falls after primary school years, the club helmed by 27-year-old Zoe Sugg - the fashion and beautyYouTube vlogger,externalknown as Zoella - is arguably a good thing. Author Alex Bell's Frozen Charlotte was chosen for Zoella's 2016 crop of reads and she says ""it meant the book was able to reach a much wider audience than it would otherwise"". ""Zoella's book club is particularly worthwhile because it helps get teenagers excited about books and reading for pleasure, which is a wonderful thing,"" she adds. Zoella and the other female star book-clubbers demonstrate the trend for reading groups in the real world to be mostly (90%) made up of women, according to Sue Wilkinson at the Reading Agency. Heat's Isabelle Broom suggests this is because ""women like to feel part of something, and lots of us like to feel validated, too... Plus, us girls LOVE to chat"". But, while the reason needs further investigation, says Wilkinson, what is clear is that ""real"" book clubs - in libraries, homes and pubs - are still a big deal, and the agency has more than 4,000 in its reading groups network. And what of the future of the virtual celebrity club? ""They have a shelf-life and people like Emma Watson will get bored and start looking for the next new thing,"" says Claire Armitstead. ""But someone else will come along. There's no end of people who want to hitch their wagon to the star of reading.""

"Ten years ago, a terror attack aiming to kill hundreds of innocent holidaymakers failed because of a concrete door post and the actions of ordinary people who were at Glasgow Airport that day. In recent months the UK has seen a number of attacks in which vehicles have been used in an attempt to kill large numbers of people - but a decade ago the attack was unlike any other. It was also the first time Scotland had been targeted for a terrorist attack. A Jeep Cherokee laden with propane gas cylinders and petrol cans was driven at speed into the doors of the Glasgow Airport departure area on one of the busiest days of the year. At 15:11, 4,000 people were already inside the terminal and the departure halls were packed with passengers waiting to board flights on the first Saturday of the Scottish school summer holidays, when the car came smashing towards them. It was only a concrete pillar at the main door that stopped the Jeep causing a fireball in the departure hall and a horrendous tragedy. The SUV could not get into the main concourse where holidaymakers watched in horror. The departure hall of the airport was packed at the time of the attack Inside the vehicle were Iraqi doctor Bilal Abdulla, 27, and 28-year-old engineer Kafeel Ahmed, who was born in India and grew up in Saudi Arabia. When the Jeep failed to explode, Abdulla threw petrol bombs from the passenger seat and Ahmed doused himself in petrol and set it alight. Then, as stunned holidaymakers began to run for their lives, Abdulla got out of the vehicle and attacked a policeman who had appeared on the scene. He was tackled by passers-by, including Alex McIlveen, a taxi driver who had just dropped off a fare when he saw the attack. As Mr McIlveen and others fought with Abdulla, his co-conspirator Ahmed got out of the Jeep, totally covered in flames, and went to the boot of the car. An off-duty police officer hosed the burning man with a fire extinguisher as he tried to open the boot of the car, which unknown to the officer contained gas canisters and petrol. Despite his severe burns Kafeel Ahmed carried on fighting as they tried to pull him away from the car. Alex McIlveen told a BBC documentary in 2008: ""I was pure daft because I gave him a kick in the crotch. ""He didnae flinch. He didnae move nor nothing. I gave him a good kick as well."" McIlveen tore a tendon in his foot when he kicked Ahmed in the groin. Off-duty police officer Stewart Ferguson hosed down the burning Kafeel Ahmed Two police officers sprayed CS spray in Ahmed's eyes in order to subdue him but he continued to resist and it was Stephen Clarkson, who was at the airport to pick up family, who brought him to the ground with a blow to the chest. Mr Clarkson told BBC Scotland: ""More or less as soon as he hit the ground the police were on top of him."" Former detective David Swindle, who was in charge of the police operation on the day, told BBC Scotland: ""If it had not been for the concrete pillar that vehicle could have been inside the airport and you could never imagine the casualties that would have happened there. ""Looking at CCTV from inside the airport, where you see people running screaming in horror, you would never understand what could have happened there. ""Thankfully only for the sake of that and the intervention of members of the public, who actually challenged these people, we will never know what could have happened."" Det Supt Swindle added: ""That was the first time a vehicle had been used as an attack of terror and it was in Scotland. There was always a belief it could never happen here. ""It did happen and it was a shocking spectacular event that everyone in Scotland will remember."" Kafeel Ahmed died from severe burns a month after the Glasgow attack Kafeel Ahmed suffered 90% burns in the attack but he did not die immediately. It was over a month before he was pronounced dead at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. This was the same hospital in which Bilal Abdulla had worked prior to the attack. Bilal Abdulla was sentenced to at least 32 years in jail for his part in the Glasgow and London attacks Abdulla was found guilty at Woolwich Crown Court in London of conspiracy to murder by planning car bomb attacks, with accomplice Ahmed. He was sentenced to at least 32 years in jail. Abdulla admitted in court that he was ""a terrorist"" as defined by English law. He went on to say he believed the British government and Army could equally be accused of terrorism for their actions in Iraq. But he added he had wanted to frighten people rather than murder them. The year before the attack, Ahmed gave a lecture about the injustices suffered by Muslims all over the world. Police found a hoard of jihadist material on his computer and he had listened to lectures by Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures. The attack on Glasgow Airport appears to have been a response to the failure of two massive car bombs in London the day before. Abdulla and Ahmed are thought to have been planning the London bombings for months. They had driven to London in two cars packed with gas canisters, petrol and thousands of nails. The car were left outside Tiger Tiger nightclub, near Piccadilly Circus, and in nearby Cockspur Street in the city's West End. The plan was to detonate the bombs using a homemade device of a syringe full of matches and a mobile phone but the cars failed to explode and the attackers knew the police were on their trail. It was at this point that Abdulla and Ahmed decided to launch a suicide attack on Glasgow Airport. During Abdulla's court case, prosecutors said that in both attacks it was good fortune alone that there had been no loss of innocent life. Speaking about the London attacks, the judge said: ""Your murderous intent was best shown by the obstructing of the safety mechanisms on two of the cylinders and by the 800-plus nails in one car and 1,000 in the second, designed to do nothing else but constitute a deadly form of shrapnel to maim, injure and kill."" He added: ""You were both undeterred and immediately put the second attack into effect, which had probably been designed as the grand finale of your conspiracy.""

"If Sir Vince Cable becomes Lib Dem leader - and he faces no challengers at the moment - we will have the oldest line-up of party leaders in the Commons since the 1950s. Has British politics finally got over its obsession with youth? Politics is one of the few fields where being in your 40s is seen as being young. When Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997 at the age of 43, much was made of the fact that he was the youngest occupant of Downing Street since 1812. The first opposition leader he faced, William Hague, was even younger, at 36. And he wore a baseball cap to prove it, which, on reflection, was probably a mistake. When Charles Kennedy took over as Lib Dem leader in 1999, at the age of 39, it was the youngest line-up of leaders the Commons had ever seen. Two decades later and leadership has skipped a generation upwards. Sir Vince is 74, Theresa May is 60 and Jeremy Corbyn 68. Tony Blair was the youngest prime minister since 1812 As Channel 4's Michael Crick has pointed out, this is the oldest collection of party leaders the Commons has seen since April 1955, when 80-year-old Sir Winston Churchill was prime minister, up against Labour leader Clement Attlee, 72, and 71-year-old Liberal leader Clement Davis. Churchill and Attlee were political giants, but they were in the twilight of their careers and, in Churchill's case, in poor health. Both were under constant pressure to stand aside for younger men. But the idea that political leaders should always be vigorous go-getters, open to new ideas and the latest trends, ideally with a camera-ready wife and children, did not really take off until the decade that followed, when being young was suddenly all that seemed to matter. Youngest UK party leader and prime minister:William Pitt, the Younger, a Whig who was regarded as a Tory by opponents, became prime minister in 1783 at the age of 24 Oldest UK party leader and prime minister:Liberal Party leader William Gladstone, pictured, resigned in 1894 at the age of 84. Sir Winston Churchill was 80 when he retired as prime minister and Conservative leader in 1955 Oldest US president:At 70, Donald Trump is the oldest person to enter office. Ronald Reagan, who was 77 when his presidency ended in 1989, was the oldest person to hold the office Youngest US president:Theodore Roosevelt, who became president at the age of 42 after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901, was the youngest person to assume the office. John F Kennedy remains the youngest person, at 43, to be elected to the White House The catalyst was Harold Wilson, who was 47 when he became Labour leader in 1963. The pipe smoking, avuncular character in a grey raincoat was sold to the public as a youthful, dynamic breath of fresh air. Not as glamorous, perhaps, as the then US president John F Kennedy, who was just a year younger than Wilson, but certainly a lot younger, and more in touch with the modern world, than 70-year-old Tory leader Harold Macmillan. It is a short step from Wilson chumming around with The Beatles at the Variety Club awards in 1964 to Tony Blair hosting Noel Gallagher at Number 10. Harold Wilson courts the youth vote at the Variety Club awards in 1964 Being young and hip, or being able to stand next to someone who is young and hip without making a complete fool of yourself, had become a key attribute for aspiring political leaders. Like his friend and political soul-mate Bill Clinton, Tony Blair was self-consciously youthful in a way that will be instantly familiar to embarrassed teenagers everywhere. He was even pictured walking into Downing Street with an electric guitar. And although prejudices against female and ethnic minority politicians began to crumble during the Blair-Clinton years, ageism lingered on. Political leaders appeared to come with a self-imposed sell-by-date. ""At the time of the next election, I'll be 67 or 68 and I believe that is simply too old to lead a party into government,"" said Michael Howard in 2005, as he claimed the then 64-year-old Ken Clarke was too old to succeed him as Conservative leader. Mr Howard's 39-year-old protege, David Cameron, fitted the youthful bill, and earned bragging rights in the Commons when he told the no-longer-quite-so-youthful Tony Blair: ""You were the future once."" He even broke Tony Blair's youngest prime minister record by a few weeks. Bernie Sanders is a hit with young political activists But can you have too much of a good (or bad, depending on your point of view) thing? Smooth, identikit politicians such as Mr Cameron, his coalition partner, Nick Clegg, and their Labour opponent at the 2015 election, Ed Miliband, were all in their 40s with young children. The stage was set for a grizzled veteran, even if he did not realise it at the time. ""At my age I'm not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?""Jeremy Corbyn told the Guardian,external, after surprising himself, and everyone else, by getting on to the Labour leadership ballot in 2015. The wild enthusiasm among young left-wing activists for Mr Corbyn gave the lie to the idea - long-held by broadcasters as well as politicians - that the under-30s could relate only to people their own age. Across the Atlantic, Bernie Sanders, the 75-year-old senator who lost out to 69-year-old Hillary Clinton in the battle for the Democratic nomination, is another example of a pensioner who commands crowds of adoring millennials. In the social-media age, authenticity can be prized above all else - and, whatever you think about their politics, Mr Corbyn and Mr Sanders are unspun figures who are comfortable in their own skins. Age and experience are, arguably, part of their appeal. Donald Trump is the oldest elected US president Age was not a barrier to success for Donald Trump either, who, at 70, is America's oldest elected president, beating previous record-holder Ronald Reagan by a year. Which brings us back to Sir Vince Cable, who prefers to compare himself to Churchill and William Gladstone, who became prime minister at 82, than the current occupant of the White House, but who has also faced questions over his advancing years. There weremutterings about the party going from ""dad to grandad"",externalwhen he announced his intention to stand. The former business secretary, who won back his Twickenham seat at the general election, was having none of it. ""Some of the brightest and most interesting people in British politics recently have been relatively old. You remember Bernie Sanders in America as well? I don't feel old, I feel young and energetic, and I'm very much up for a contest."" Sir Vince has always regretted not standing for the party leadership in 2007, when Sir Menzies Campbell was effectively hounded out of the job for being too old, at what these days might be described as the youthful age of 66. Sir Vince, who was then 64, apparently feared that he would also be judged too old. But now, 10 years older, and with the forty-something generation of leaders having departed the stage, that no longer seems to be an issue.
