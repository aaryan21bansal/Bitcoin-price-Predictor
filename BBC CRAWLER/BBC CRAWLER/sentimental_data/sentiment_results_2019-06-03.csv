"Donald Trump visited the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Monday morning Donald Trump and the Queen may come from different worlds, but few would deny they at least share an appreciation of pageantry - and that was not in short supply when the US president arrived at Buckingham Palace. Following the Changing the Guard, Mr Trump's helicopter - Marine One - whipped up dust from nearby Green Park as it flew overhead, eagerly followed by a Mexican wave of smartphones from the crowd below. America's leader is a man who inspires strong views on all sides - and that was evident in central London on the first day of his UK trip. ""It's our first time in London,"" said Laura Curri, visiting the UK with her family from Florida. ""We heard Trump was going to be at the palace and we're huge fans so we came down."" Her husband, John Curri, hopes the visit will lead to ""more unity"" between the US and UK. ""You're leaders over here and we're leaders in our part of the world - this visit should make us both stronger,"" he said. The Curri family were visiting the UK from Florida Asked if he thinks the president is misunderstood in the UK, Mr Curri told the BBC: ""People want honesty and strong leadership. I think now it has arrived people are scared - but it's here to stay."" And it is not just visitors to the UK who saw benefits in Mr Trump's visit. Husband and wife Tony and Jennifer Holdcroft, describing themselves as ""proud Brexiteers"", said they made the trip down from Stoke-on-Trent ""to welcome the president and combat the protesters"". Queen welcomes President Trump to palace In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing? ""We think he's a brilliant man,"" said Mrs Holdcroft. ""He's straight talking, he's firm and he looks after his own people. ""This visit is about friendship, which we've had for years and years, and keeping up the alliance."" Tony and Jennifer Holdcroft, from Stoke, were unimpressed with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's criticism of Mr Trump Mr Holdcroft added: ""At the end of the day, why shouldn't he come? All these people dissing him are dissing our Queen because she's the one who invited him. ""He has been invited as the president of America, not as Donald Trump."" While Mr Trump was being received by the Queen inside the palace, 100m away - in Green Park - the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery began putting on a show of their own. With the first deafening blast of the ceremonial guns, those waiting outside Buckingham Palace rushed over, phones outstretched ahead of them, attempting to capture the scenes. Not everyone, however, shared in the excitement. The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery perform a gun salute in Green Park, next to Buckingham Palace Dr Abdulkadar Alzuabi, who came from Manchester to protest against Mr Trump's visit, said: ""I don't think the UK should listen to him, we're different to him in this country. ""In this country, if you are British, if you are a refugee, if you are black or white, if you are European or an Arab, you are equal. ""He's trying to use his influence to change how things are in the UK. We shouldn't listen to him."" Auriel Granville - dressed as the Statue of Liberty - had made the slightly shorter trip from Wimbledon in south London, but felt just as strongly about the US president. ""I don't think he should be received in this way,"" she said. ""Climate change should be top of our agenda and Donald Trump is a climate change denier. ""He's not listening to scientists, who are all saying it is a result of human activity."" She added: ""He is doing so much damage."" Auriel Granville called Donald Trump a ""climate change denier"" and said he was doing ""so much damage"" to the world If anyone had thought Mr Trump might tone down some of his more unusual styles of diplomacy for the three-day visit, they were set straight early on Monday morning. Moments before Air Force One landed at Stansted, Mr Trump posted two tweets criticising Mayor of London Sadiq Khan,calling him a ""stone cold loser"". While some around the palace supported Mr Trump, one Londoner was so angry she had decided to come out in protest. Jill Gillard, who emigrated to the UK from South Africa in 1979, said: ""I had no intention of coming down today but then I saw his tweet about Sadiq Khan and thought: 'No, that's too much.' ""It's people like Sadiq Khan that have made me feel very welcome in this country and I feel very strongly about the discourtesy of a man who has no insight into our way of life here, which I have been very proud to embrace.""

"Jay-Z and Beyonce Jay-Z is officially hip hop's first billionaire, Forbes has declared, after building an empire based on music, property, fashion and investments. The US magazine has estimated that the rapper's wealth now ""conservatively totals"" $1bn (Â£800m). Forbes says the husband of singer Beyonce has succeeded because he built brands rather than just endorsed them. In its rankings, Forbes rejected claims that rapper and producer Dr Dre had reached billionaire status. Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, grew in one of New York City's most notorious areas. He hit fame in 1996 with his debut album Reasonable Doubt. His 2001 album The Blueprint was in March added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry because it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Forbes said it had estimated Jay-Z's wealth,externalby adding various assets and then ""subtracting a healthy amount to account for a superstar lifestyle"". Among the 49-year-old's assets are: A $75m music catalogue Stakes in Armand de Brignac champagne and D'Usse cognac, worth $410m in total A stake in Uber worth about $70m Property in fashionable parts of New York and Los Angeles A $100m stake in the music streaming service Tidal An art collection valued about $50m His superstar wife is reportedly worth about $335m, made mostly from music and endorsements, and the couple have had a joint net worth over $1bn for several years. Jay-Z, who once rapped ""I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man"", is one of only a handful of entertainers to become billionaires, according to Forbes. It was often assumed that Dr Dre reached billionaire status in 2014 after selling his Beats headphone business to Apple. But last year Forbes put his personal wealth at about $770m. Dr Dre is not a billionaire - at least according to Forbes Kasseem ""Swizz Beatz"" Dean, the producer behind some of Jay-Z's biggest hits, told Forbes that the rapper's success is ""bigger than hip-hop"". He said: ""It's the blueprint for our culture. A guy that looks like us, sounds like us, loves us, made it to something that we always felt that was above us."" Jay-Z appears on the the front cover of the latest Forbes magazine alongside another - wealthier - billionaire, Warren Buffet. It appears that the legendary investor, 40 years his senior, spotted something special in the rapper a few years ago, telling Forbes in 2010: ""Jay is teaching in a lot bigger classroom than I'll ever teach in. For a young person growing up, he's the guy to learn from.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonny Dymond on what to expect from President Trump's visit to the UK US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are making a state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Here's a rundown of what we can expect. It's a formal trip to the UK by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. Although they're grand occasions, they're not just ceremonial affairs - they're also used by the government to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state per year and has hosted 112 of these visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Familyhas a full list of all the other state visits,external, and details ofhow the ceremonies unfold,external. Visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, but because Buckingham Palace is being renovated the US president is not expected to stay there. While Mr Trump is only the third US president to make a state visit to the UK, the Queenhas met almost all the US presidents in office during that time, either in the UK or in the US. On Monday, the first day of Mr Trump's three-day trip, a ceremonial welcome attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall was held in the Buckingham Palace garden. After the welcome, the Duke of Sussex joined the group for a private lunch at the palace. This video can not be played Here's what happened on day one of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK (tweets not included). Mr and Mrs Trump then visited Westminster Abbey for a tour and met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea at Clarence House. Astate banquet in the palace's ballroom took place on Monday evening, with Mr Trump, the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with other UK public figures and prominent Americans living in Britain. The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May will host a business breakfast attended by the Duke of York at St James's Palace. Business leaders understood to be attending include Barclays CEO Jes Staley, GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Emma Walmsley, BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and the National Grid's John Pettigrew. Mr Trump will then visit Downing Street for talks with Theresa May. They are expected to discuss a range of issues on which they hold differing views - includingclimate changeandHuawei. Trump visit: A barometer of political power The talks will be followed by a joint press conference. Mrs May is due to step down as prime minister on 7 June. Thousands of people are expected to join protests against Mr Trump's visit in UK cities on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the London rally in Trafalgar Square, where he will be joined by members of other political parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. In the evening, the Trumps will host a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador attended by Charles and Camilla on behalf of the Queen. The trip is expected to culminate on Wednesday 5 June with Mr Trump, the Queen and Prince Charles attending the national commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. More than 300 veterans will be at the ceremony, which will feature musical performances, testimonial readings and military displays. Trump visit 'will detract from D-Day event' Following the D-Day event Mr Trump will travel to his hotel and golf resort in Doonbeg, in the Republic of Ireland. He will hold a meeting with Irish premier Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport. A visiting leader will sometimes speak at the Houses of Parliament during a state visit, but Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Tuesday he had not received a request for Mr Trump to do so. The president has suggested he ""may"" meet Conservative MP and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage during his visit -both of whom he described as ""friends"" and ""good guys"". The prime minister says the visit is a chance for the UK and the US to strengthen their ""already close relationship"". Talks will cover areas such as trade, investment, security and defence. But Mr Trump is a controversial figure and many have opposed the visit. Thousands gathered to protest against President Trump's policies when he visited the UK in 2018 His policies - from the executive order that restricts entry to the US from certain countries, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - have provoked criticism, both domestically and internationally. And that is to say nothing about some of the comments he's made - including outspoken attacks against political opponents, the media, and his critics - and the investigation into his links to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also declined an invitation. Others argue that the US is a key ally of the UK and that Mr Trump should be welcomed accordingly. When the president's on the move - you know about it The security operation surrounding Mr Trump's visit could cost more than Â£18m. It is intended to createan impenetrable ring of steelaround the US president. The president arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, with space for conference and dining rooms and a medical facility with an operating table. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines nicknamed The Beast and other security and communications vehicles, was flown across ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. In 2018, almost 10,000 officers from the UK were deployed for Mr Trump's trip, with nearly every force in the country providing staff to support the operation. This video can not be played Dinner, talks and golf: A look back at President Trump's last visit to the UK It was certainly eventful. As well as holding talks with Mrs May at her country residence, Chequers, and having tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle, the trip was marked by demonstrations. Tens of thousands of peoplegathered in central London to protest against him. There was also a six-metre ""Trump baby"" blimp - depicting the president as a nappy-wearing infant - inflated outside Parliament. And at his golf resort at Turnberry, Ayrshire,one protester paraglided over the hotelas Mr Trump played the course. Campaigners have claimed they will mobilise ""huge numbers"" in response to Mr Trump's arrival. On Monday supporters of the human rights charity Amnesty unfurled five banners facing the US embassy on Vauxhall Bridge, reading ""Resist sexism"", ""Resist racism"", ""Resist hate"", ""Resist cruelty"" and ""Resist Trump"". A ""national demonstration"" in London's Trafalgar Square will start at 11:00 BST on Tuesday, while protests are also planned in Birmingham, Stoke, Sheffield, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Chester, Leicester, Oxford and Exeter. A 16ft talking robot of Mr Trump sitting on a golden toilet is also expected to make an appearance. Trump visit: A barometer of power Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond speaks to Newsnight The chancellor has rejected claims there are millions of people living in dire poverty in Britain. ""Look around you; that's not what we see in this country,"" Philip Hammond told Newsnight. Mr Hammond accepted that some people were struggling. But he said the government had worked to tackle the causes of poverty and rejecteda United Nations report that claimed austerity had increased poverty. Published last month, the rapporteur accused the government of plunging millions into poverty, in some instances with ""tragic consequences"". Mr Hammond said: ""I reject the idea that there are vast numbers of people facing dire poverty in this country. ""I don't accept the UN rapporteur's report at all. I think that's a nonsense. Look around you, that's not what we see in this country. ""Of course there are people struggling with the cost of living. I understand that. But the point being is that we are addressing these things through getting to the root causes."" The chancellor said that for many people, the market economy was not working as it was ""supposed to"", and the idea the economy is ""generating and distributing wealth is at odds with the practice that they are experiencing"". He said the government should be ensuring the market was ""delivering in the way that the textbooks tell us it will work. ""To deliver through competition, the best deal for consumers and to distribute wealth in a way that is fair. ""To the extent that it's not working, we have got to evolve the system."" The UN report citesindependent experts,externalsaying that 14m people in the UK - a fifth of the population - live in poverty, according to a new measure that takes into account costs such as housing and childcare. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation,1.5m people experienced destitution in 2017,external- meaning they had less than Â£10 a day after housing costs, or had to go without at least two essentials such as shelter, food, heat, light, clothing or toiletries during a one-month period. Mr Hammond's comments came during an interview on Monday with Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, in which he warned MPs vying to be leader of the Conservative Party that they risked becoming ""Theresa May mark two"" unless they accepted the realities of Brexit. The chancellor, who has yet to reveal who he will support in his party's leadership race, laid down a challenge for the candidates. ""Explain to me how you will avoid becoming Theresa May mark two, stuck in a holding pattern,"" he said. He criticised some of the candidates' Brexit plans. ""An extension of time to try to renegotiate, when the EU have already said they have finished the negotiation and, indeed, have disbanded their negotiating team, strikes me as a not very auspicious policy."" Watch: McVey outlines her plans for Brexit Matt Hancock proposes Irish border council Gyimah backs referendum in leadership bid Hammond: Another EU referendum possible He added: ""The debate we're having now is here, in the UK, about whether we are going to sign the Withdrawal Agreement or not, and about what kind of future relationship we then want to have - because the European Union is willing to talk to us about the shape of the future relationship."" Mr Hammond also said he believed that MPs from all sides should ""stop pontificating and get off their high horses"" in an effort to resolve the Brexit impasse. Asked whether he would prefer a no-deal outcome or no Brexit, he replied: ""Neither is an acceptable outcome, because no deal would be catastrophic for the country and its economy - and no Brexit would be seen as a gross breach of faith with the public."" He added: ""So we as democrats and we as parliamentarians should be absolutely clear that we cannot tolerate either of those outcomes,"" and said ""we have a solemn obligation to find a solution which avoids"" either. He said that meant a deal was required. ""We will all be grumpy about it, we will all be dissatisfied. But in many ways that is the only way forward for the country,"" he said. ""If we end up with a deal that means half the people in this country think they achieved total victory and the other half think they have been totally defeated, that is not the recipe for unity in the future. And countries that are not unified are not successful."" The full interview with Chancellor Philip Hammond will be broadcast on Newsnight at 10.30pm Monday on BBC2.

"This video can not be played Tim Cook: ""We are moving privacy protection forward"" Apple has announced that iTunes is to be replaced by Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV. There had been speculation that the tech giant was planning to shutter the music service it launched in 2001. The firm also revealed a number of new privacy measures at its annual developer conference in San Jose. A new sign-in will be an alternative to logging into apps using social media accounts, hiding the user's email address and data. iTunes will remain unchanged on Windows platforms, and downloads will still be available in a sidebar on the Apple Music app for Macs. The announcements were made at the WWDC conference, where the tech giant outlines its software plans for the months ahead. Apple's new sign in includes an email address-hiding function Apple announced several new privacy measures, building on last year's event whereit pledged to jam Facebook's tracking tools. ""Privacy is a fundamental human right,"" said Apple's software chief Craig Federighi. He said that there will be an option for apps which request location information to have to ask every time they require it, and they will be blocked from using other markers, such as identifying Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals. Apple is also launching a sign-in-with-Apple login, as an alternative to logging in to a service using a social media account. Using this login, users can choose to hide their email address, with Apple creating a random alternative address which will forward to the real mailbox. ""The unveiling of 'Sign-in With Apple' will concern rivals, particularly the web giants,"" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""Existing sign-in services provide a simple means for single sign-in across the web. Privacy is the differentiator that will be heavily emphasised versus Facebook and Google, and represents a great marketing tool for Apple's broader privacy stance."" iOS 13 introduces Dark Mode, where apps are displayed on a black background The next iteration of the iPhone's operating system - iOS 13 - includes a range of changes to its interface, as well as new functions. The new Dark Mode enables iPhone apps to be viewed with a black background, while the Apple Maps app will come with a virtual tour experience similar to Google's Street View. Other key features include the option to silence unknown callers and block senders within the Mail app, improved search in messages, and optimised battery charging. Apple has also made improvements to its language keyboards, including the introduction of new bilingual keyboards and typing predictions for Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Cantonese, Vietnamese and the 22 official Indian languages.

They now include more accessories such as piercings and make-up The Apple Watch now comes with multiple new watch faces The Apple Watch is to become more independent from the iPhone with its own app store. New apps for the Watch include a menstrual cycle tracker, with an optional fertility window predictor, and a noise level tool to alert Watch wearers when they are around noise levels that can damage hearing. Apple said it would not record or store the noise data. The Apple Mac Pro has powerful specifications The tech giant also unveiled a redesigned Mac Pro complete with a 28-core Intel processor and 6k retina display screen, which is 40% larger than the current iMac display screen. It will launch in the autumn with prices starting at $5,999 (Â£4,700) - this does not include the screen or stand. And instead of buying additional monitors, existing Mac users will now be able to use the iPad as a second screen. Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said this year's event had a different feel to its predecessors, following on from Apple's last announcements which saw it reposition itself as a provider of services, rather than hardware. ""Typically at WWDC you might see it begin with something interesting, in terms of how devices are used or how apps interact, but this time it kicked off with a video that looked more like a movie trailer,"" he said. ""Is this the new way we should see Apple events, more rooted in the media content side of things, rather than the strong emphasis on technology and hardware innovation? ""Remember, the last event was all about services and content - this may be the new way that Apple differentiates itself.""

"Sadiq Khan and members of the emergency services were among those who attended evensong Memorial services have been held at Southwark Cathedral to mark the second anniversary of the London Bridge terror attack. Eight people were killed and 48 seriously injured when three men drove into pedestrians before stabbing people in Borough Market on 3 June 2017. An evensong began at 17:30 BST while a special prayer service finished at 22:16 - the time the attack ended. An inquest into the eight deaths has been adjourned until Tuesday. Clockwise from top left: Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack. The Old Bailey inquest into their deaths is on its 19th day of live evidence. It has heardthe attackers stalked people like ""predators""and12-inch pink kitchen kniveswhich had been bought from a Lidl supermarket weeks earlier were used during the attack.

"Yumi Ishikawa says she was made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour Around 19,000 people have signed a petition calling for Japan to end dress codes that require women to wear high heels in the workplace. The petition was started by Yumi Ishikawa who says she was made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour. Her tweets on the issue went viral with more than 30,000 shares. In 2015, a London receptionist was sent home from work without pay after she refused to wear high heels. The campaign is referred to in Japan as #KuToo.It plays on the Japanese words for shoes ""kutsu"" and pain ""kutsuu"",externaland also references the #MeToo movement, according to Kyodo News. Is it legal to force women to wear high heels at work? High heels-row firm changes policy Campaigners say that wearing high heels is seen as obligatory when applying for jobs. Ms Ishikawa, also an actress, said: ""I hope this campaign will change the social norm so that it won't be considered to be bad manners when women wear flat shoes like men."" She added that she had met a ministry official who was ""sympathetic"" towards the petition. It's not the first time that a campaign has been launched to change dress codes at work for women. Nicola Thorp set up a petition calling for UK dress code laws to be changed after she was asked to wear high heels at finance company PwC. She was hired as a temporary member of staff and refused to comply with the dress code. Following coverage in the media, outsourcing firm Portico announced that female colleagues could ""wear plain flat shoes"" with immediate effect. In 2017, a Canadian province scrapped the dress code which requires female employees to wear high heels. The government of British Columbia said that high heel wearers face arisk of physical injury from slipping or fallingas well as possible damage to the feet, legs and back.

"Dr Fielden admitted his guilt at a hearing in March An NHS doctor who spied on a teenage girl in a shower has been given a suspended prison sentence. Anaesthetist Dr Jonathan Fielden pleaded guilty to a count of voyeurism which took place between 2014 and 2016 at a private address in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Luton Crown Court heard Fielden, 55, of Regents Mews, Biddenham, had his medical registration suspended. He was arrested in December 2016 and was then suspended by the NHS. He later resigned as deputy medical director and director of specialised commissioning at NHS England. Fielden had been one of four medical directors at University College Hospital London. The court was told Fielden spied on the 15-year-old girl through a hole in the ceiling. He admitted doing it for his own sexual gratification. Judge Richard Foster told Fielden: ""It's tragic to see you, a man of such brilliance in your career - a hardworking man at the pinnacle of your career, responsible for a substantial part of the NHS budget - to fall from grace in the way you have because of what you stupidly did."" He sentenced Fielden to five months imprisonment suspended for 12 months and ordered he carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Prosecutor Kate Fortescue said the teenager had been left ""deeply shocked"" after the incident and had struggled to shower for some time. Alexandra Felix, for Fielden, said he had been under pressure at work which had led to a lapse in judgement. She said: ""He accepts it shouldn't have happened, but it did, not because of any concerted effort to do it. Circumstances arose for it to happen."" Fielden has also been made subject of a sexual harm prevention order and his name will go on the sex offenders register.

"Donald Trump is making a much-delayed state visit to Britain this week. Over three days the US president will be hosted by royalty and politicians. He will also take part in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But behind the pageantry lie policy differences that divide Britain and the United States. Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing? Trump says Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader State visits are primarily royal affairs, with the emphasis as much on ceremony as politics. But even so, the potential for slip-ups is huge. Donald Trump made a mistake last year when he turned his back on the Queen and walked in front of her while inspecting the guard at Windsor Castle. This time there will be the tricky moment when he gives a speech at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Will he address the Queen correctly? Recently the White House mistakenly referred to her as ""Her Royal Majesty"". (Those who deal regularly with royalty would know that it should just be ""Her Majesty""). Will Mr Trump continue speaking during the National Anthem, as President Obama did in 2011? When Mr Trump has tea with the Prince of Wales at Clarence House, will they manage to avoid airing their rather different views on climate change? Mr Trump met the Queen when he visited the UK last year The president has no incentive to mess things up - he clearly likes the pomp and pageantry of royalty and will want the pictures to look good back home ahead of his re-election campaign. But there remains the question of how much advice he will take from his protocol team. The biggest potential flashpoint - in theory - could be the Duchess of Sussex who, in her past, pre-regal life, expressed opposition to Mr Trump's views.The US president told The Sun newspaper,externalhe was surprised Meghan had been so ""nasty"" about him. Perhaps fortuitously, the Duchess is still on maternity leave and will play no part in the visit. But it will not have gone unnoticed that an American citizen who only recently married into the British royal family - and thus epitomizes the close relationship between both countries - will not be part of the team welcoming her president to these shores. Mr Trump's visit comes at a tricky time politically for Britain. He will be visiting the lamest of lame duck prime ministers in the form of Theresa May who is standing down as Conservative leader at the end of the week. Britain is still gripped by the dread hand of the Brexit debate. In his Sun interview, the president criticised Mrs May for allowing the EU ""to have all the cards"" in the negotiations. And, in an interview published a day later, he told the Sunday Times the governmentshould bring in Nigel Farage- an arch critic of Mrs May - to help the Brexit negotiations. This week's visit is scheduled to include a joint news conference with Theresa May, something the pair did when he came to the UK last July Mr Trump had already expressed his support for Nigel Farage, saying the leader of the newly-formed Brexit Party was his friend, a ""big power"" in the UK and someone for whom he had a lot of respect. Will Mr Trump find time to meet Mr Farage? Downing Street has rejected the idea of there being an official meeting between the two, but might there be time for a quick cup of tea at Winfield House, the London residence of the US ambassador? Neither side are ruling it out. One minister told me this would be seen as both disappointing and rude. But Mr Trump rarely misses a chance to associate with like-minded politicians, if nothing else to emphasise what he sees as the growing success of his kind of politics. He will not mind that the two main opposition party leaders - Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Vince Cable - have refused their invitations to dine with him at the state banquet. Mr Trump also arrives in the middle of the Conservative leadership contest that will determine the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. He has already backed one candidate, the front-runner, Boris Johnson. The president told The Sun the former foreign secretary would be an excellent prime minister who would do ""a very good job"". On one hand, there will be some Conservative MPs and party members who will be impressed by this, welcoming the idea that a potential future prime minister already has a good relationship with a close ally. On the other, there may be some MPs who believe the unofficial endorsement from an unpopular US president might not endear Mr Johnson to the wider British electorate, which has more mixed feelings about Mr Trump. This video can not be played Trump: I like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage Remember that Mr Trump has already backed Mr Johnson, saying when he was in the UK last year that Mr Johnson - a former US citizen - would make ""a great prime minister"". Equally interesting would be any remarks Mr Trump chooses to make about the Labour leader, Mr Corbyn, who could one day be the person he meets for lunch in Downing Street, a leader who has made no secret of his hostility towards many US policies. Mr Trump told The Sun he was ""not offended"" by Mr Corbyn's refusal to attend the state banquet, saying: ""He is probably making a mistake because I think he would want to get along with the United States."" In a visit focused on ceremony and talks with an outgoing prime minister, the opportunity to discuss substantive policy will be, by necessity, constrained. But there will be much to disagree about in a trip that is supposed to emphasise unity. Take, for example, the Middle East. The British and US disagree about how best to change Iran's behaviour - the UK still supports the agreement designed to curb Tehran's nuclear programme, the US does not and is ready to sanction any British firm or bank that trades with Iran. The US has deployed a carrier strike force and B52 bombers to the region, something some British diplomats fear could provoke escalation, even war. Are these differences something Mr Trump will wish to raise in public? Is the United States heading for war with Iran? Trump: War would mean 'end of Iran' The president will also bring with him his adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is expected soon to announce the US so-called ""deal of the century"" to try to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The British government is concerned about any attempt to impose a unilateral plan that disposes of the two-state solution and seeks to buy off the Palestinians with hard cash. The Americans have already made it clear they are willing to press ahead without European support, just so long as they have the backing of one or two Arab states. Will any tough talking in Downing Street spill over into the news conference that follows? Let us not forget China. The growing confrontation between the US and China is worrying British policymakers, not just because of the potential impact on global economic growth. But there is also the not so minor matter of Huawei. The US is already angry at the decision - yet to be finalised - by British ministersto consider allowing the Chinese telecoms giant to build part of the UK's 5G mobile network. They fear this would potentially give the Chinese state access - via Huawei - to British and thus American secrets. Huawei: The world's most controversial company? Beijing defends Huawei amid 5G row US officials are warning that Mr Trump will not only raise this during the state visit but may even threaten to limit sharing intelligence with the UK as a result. Just consider what that might mean: the so-called ""special relationship"" has always had as a central core the sharing of intelligence - a relationship between security professionals that is supposed to be eternal, outside the squalls of political disagreement. So it would be hard for the president to praise UK-US relations while at the same time threatening to withhold intelligence. US officials say they are reassured that the UK decision on Huawei is not final and on hold until a new prime minister is elected. But they cannot rule out strong words on the subject from their president. Mr Trump, of course, once suggested that UK intelligence agencies were involved in a plot against his election - something they dismissed publicly as ridiculous nonsense.

"This video can not be played M4: What could you spend Â£1.4bn on? Speculation is building that First Minister Mark Drakeford will scrap plans for a Â£1.4bn M4 relief road south of Newport. Transport expert Prof Stuart Cole has questioned how it could go ahead after the Welsh Governmentdeclared a climate emergency. One Labour AM, Alun Davies, said he was assuming the first minister will not back the scheme. The decision is expected to be announced on Tuesday. Since the UK government announced borrowing powers for the Welsh Government, ministers have pursued building a new six-lane motorway south of Newport, re-opening proposals that date as far back as 1991. Welsh Labour's manifesto for the 2016 election said the party would deliver ""an M4 relief road"". What is it like to live near the M4? What could you spend Â£1.4bn on? Is there One Direction for Â£1.4bn road? The Welsh Government, under the previous first minister Carwyn Jones, commissioned a public inquiry. BBC Wales reported in February that Â£44mhad been spent on development costsand the inquiry. After Mr Jones stepped down as first minister in December the decision has rested with his successor Mr Drakeford, who is widely assumed to be a sceptic about the project's benefits. The proposed relief road would run south of Newport and the existing motorway Mr Drakeford has been considering the inquiry's findings, which are also set to be published on Tuesday. The project is hugely divisive, attracting opposition from environmentalists because of the impact on wildlife on the Gwent Levels, and support from business lobby group CBI and the UK government. Observers will be waiting to see if Mr Drakeford backs alternative upgrades to the road infrastructure around Newport, if he chooses not to go ahead with the six-lane scheme. Alun Davies, Blaenau Gwent AM, said on Twitter at the weekend that he was assuming Mark Drakeford ""will choose not to go ahead with the M4"". Stuart Cole speculated that Mark Drakeford would drop the scheme ""There must therefore be some immediate road improvements around Newport and an unprecedented investment in public transport,"" he said. Another Labour source said they could not see Mr Drakeford going ahead with the project. ""The climate change emergency declaration makes it very difficult now for Mark to approve it,"" the source said. Prof Cole, an opponent of the M4 relief road and a backer of the blue route alternative of upgrading existing routes, told BBC Wales a decision to build the road ""doesn't fit"" with the Welsh Government's recent decision to declare a climate emergency.

""There's no point having an inquiry if politicians are going to make up their minds without taking it into account,"" the source said.

Mark Drakeford is expected to take the M4 decision on Tuesday The mood music on the Welsh Government's preferred black route changed from a major to a minor key when Mark Drakeford was elected as Welsh Labour leader in December. As finance secretary he talked about a cheaper option to the black route being ""attractive"". But on taking the top job, he promised to look with fresh eyes at the report from the public inquiry before announcing a decision. There were also questions over whether his appointment of Lee Waters, a vocal opponent of the relief road, as a minister in the transport department (albeit one who would have no involvement with the decision) was a signal the Welsh Government was planning a U-turn on its backing for the plan.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledges to tackle violence against indigenous women Canada is complicit in a ""race-based genocide"" against indigenous women, a government inquiry has found. The report cited research finding indigenous women were 12 times more likely to be killed or to disappear than other women in Canada. The inquiry blamed the crisis on deep-rooted colonialism and state inaction. Among more than 200 recommendations is a call for all Canadians to help end violence, including by learning indigenous history. The 1,200-page document released Monday is the culmination of almost three years of hearings and research by the inquiry into disproportionate violence faced by indigenous women and girls in Canada. Red River women - the case that sparked the inquiry ""Despite their different circumstances and backgrounds, all of the missing and murdered are connected by economic, social, and political marginalisation, racism and misogyny woven into the fabric of Canadian society,"" said Marion Buller, chief commissioner of the inquiry. It cost C$92m ($67m; Â£53m), and heard from more than 2,000 witnesses since 2017 - including survivors of violence and family members. Activists say thousands of indigenous women and girls may have been killed Mr Trudeau's government launched the national inquiry in September 2016, after years of calls for one by indigenous and international organisations. Notable cases of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls had fuelled the call for a national inquiry, including the Vancouver murders by Robert Pickton, and the death of schoolgirl Tina Fontaine. In 2015, a landmark Truth and Reconciliation report into the legacy of residential schools in Canada issued a damning verdict - that the policy amounted to ""cultural genocide"". Monday's document takes that finding a step further saying that the murder and disappearance indigenous women and girls over the past few decades has amounted to a ""race-based genocide of indigenous peoples"". Canada promises 'full reconciliation' Giving a voice to missing and murdered women The report found that ""persistent and deliberate human and indigenous rights violations and abuses are the root cause behind Canada's staggering rates of violence"". Past inquiries and investigations in Canada - from the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples to the more recent Truth and Reconciliation report - have put forward about 900 wide-ranging recommendations to deal with many of the underlying issues. Many have never been applied. ""One of the family members' and survivors' biggest fears in opening themselves up to this process as intense as this one is that in the end, nothing is done - the report gathers dust on a shelf and the recommendations are left unanswered,"" the final report said. Surviving Canada's 'cultural genocide' The amateur sleuth who searched for a body - and found one By Jessica Murphy, BBC News in Ottawa The document released by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is dense, at well over 1,000 pages. But - as is often the case - it's the personal stories that cut through the formal language. The voices of some of the families were included in the report, bringing emotional weight to the two phone directory-sized volumes. ""Tamara Lynn Chipman stole her daddy's heart from the moment she was born,"" begins a foreword by Gladys Radek. ""She grew into a tall, lanky, charming, beautiful young lady with a smile that would brighten anybody's day."" Tamara vanished on 21 September, 2005, along the Highway of Tears in the province of British Columbia, a route notorious for the number of women who have gone missing or died along its 724 km (450 miles). Or the words of Jeremiah Bosse - widower of Daleen Bossee - who admits to early doubts about the inquiry: ""Will this actually work or help?"" He writes: ""Today I feel hopeful for the first time that as victims of violence our words will be heard. The words of our loved ones are spoken."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - who has made reconciliation with indigenous peoples a priority for his government - thanked those that shared stories with the commission, and vowed to enact the inquiry's recommendations. ""This is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day,"" he said. Mr Trudeau did not mention genocide in his speech - a fact that was not lost on MichÃ¨le Audette, one of the report's commissioners. ""I was hoping that he would have that courage,"" she said during a press conference. Today was a long time coming for many victims and their family. Schoolgirl Tina Fontaine was found dumped in Winnipeg's Red River in August 2014 ""This journey has been emotional but also uplifting, because I've been able to share this day with all these families,"" Shelia LeDoux told the BBC. Her niece went missing in 1992, but her remains were not found until four years later. ""Her voice is silent but I feel like I'm her voice, and I feel like I've carried forward with what I've promised."" Barbara Sevigny, whose sister was murdered 33 years ago, said today validated the pain she and her family have experienced. ""Our lives matter too. That became very real,"" she told the BBC, her voice cracking. She said she is has been disillusioned by broken promises in the past, and is waiting to see what steps the government will take. The chief commissioner said that nothing short of a ""paradigm shift"" is necessary to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society. Ms Buller urged Canadians: ""Read the report, speak out against sexism, racism, and misogyny. Hold government to account and decolonise yourself by learning about indigenous people and the true history of Canada."" The inquiry called on the federal government to create an independent mechanism for reporting annually on how the recommendations are being implemented. Other recommendations include: Develop a national action plan to tackle violence against indigenous women and girls and ensure equitable access to public services Establish a National Indigenous and Human Rights Ombudsperson For governments to recognise and protect indigenous language rights and give them official language status For all levels of government to ensure support for programmes and services for indigenous women and girls in the sex industry Canada promises 'full reconciliation' Indigenous women deaths 'a Canadian genocide' 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

He admitted he had taken part in the programme ""for a dare"". ""One of the guys, as I was coming off the stage in our club dared me having sung after the curry lunch,"" explained Thackery, who is from Thorpe St Andrew in Norwich, on Britain's Got More Talent. ""He said, 'When are going to do it?' I said, 'What?' and he said 'Go on Britain's Got Talent'. I said ''Don't be silly'."" Allow YouTube content?

""I served my Queen for 25 years and to think I could sing for her would be the end,"" he told hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. According to overnight figures, an average 8.2 million people tuned in live to Sunday night's final, a 40% share of the audience. That figure rises to 8.5 million when those watching on ITV+1 are included. In 2018, an average of8.7 million viewers tuned in live to watch Lost Voice Guywin the competition, the highest figures since 2015 when dancing dog act Jules O'Dwyer & Matisse were crowned. When the show launched in 2007,more than 11 million watched opera singer Paul Potts crowned its first winnerwhile an audience of 16.4 million saw Diversity dance their way to success in 2009, with 18.29 million tuning in for the results show. The viewing environment has altered dramatically over the past decade. So BGT's overnight audience of 8.5 million is a strong performance at a time when watching patterns are constantly changing. While the talent show is no longer enjoying the huge dominance it had ten years ago, Sunday night's figures still represent the show's biggest overnight audience for a final since 2015. This weekend has also seen some notable viewing figures withSaturday night's Champions League Finalgiving BT Sport its biggest ever overnight rating, peaking at more than 6 million viewers. Along with Game of Thrones on Sky Atlantic, it's an additional example of how a particularly popular piece of programming can draw large audiences away from the traditional big broadcasters. The BBC's Line of Duty series five finale is, so far 2019's most watched piece of television There's still lots of good news around for the likes of BBC One and ITV. The final 28 day viewing figures for the May finale of BBC One's Line of Duty (above) have now been published. It's been watched by 13.67 million, including catch-up platforms, making it 2019's most watched piece of television. It joins a small select group of shows, major sporting events aside, that can still achieve figures in excess of 13 million. Over the past year, these have included writer Jed Mercurio's other big BBC drama Bodyguard, Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Masked Magician X was the runner-up and shocked the judges and audience by revealing he was actually former contestant Marc Spelmann, who appeared in the 2018 series but failed to make it to the final. Spelman's big reveal was preceded by a video montage of his previous performances during which Ant is seen saying: ""Imagine at the end he takes it off and it's someone we know?"" Close to tears, he told the audience: ""It was always about hope. I'm never giving up. It's been an honour sharing X with you. I'm X,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

"Climbers pay a premium in order to climb the mountain Over the past two decades, the average annual death rate of climbers on Mount Everest has remained at about six. But this spring, at least10 people have already been reported dead or missing on the world's highest peak. This is also the season that saw a record 381 climbing permits issued by the Nepalese government. In reality, this means about 600 people were preparing to embark on the climb, with permit holders accompanied by support staff up the mountain. While overcrowding has been blamed for the increase in the number of deaths, there are also other factors at play. Many of the climbers began gathering at Everest base camp at the start of May. At the same time, the authorities were concerned about the knock-on effects of Cyclone Faniwhich had already struck India and Bangladesh. The weather deteriorated in the Nepalese Himalayas days after the cyclone, forcing the government to suspend all mountaineering activities for at least two days. Why the summit can get so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Queues not 'sole reason' for Everest deaths Nearly 20 tents at the camp were blown away by strong winds and after the warning, several climbers, who were already en route to some of the higher camps, returned to base camp. Prolonged bad weather meant that the practice of fixing bolted rope to assist climbers trying to reach the summit was delayed. British climber Robin Haynes Fisher (pictured) is among those who have died this year Meanwhile the crowd at base camp continued to build. Everest - which lies on the border between Nepal and China - can be reached from the Chinese side as well. However, the Chinese government issues fewer permits, and many mountaineering experts find the climb less interesting. After the ropes were fixed by mid-May, the first feasible clear-weather window was 19 and 20 May. But only a few teams chose to climb then while the majority waited for the second window - from 22 to 24 May. Mountaineering experts say this was when the crowd management went wrong. 23 May saw the maximum number of climbers on one day - more than 250. Climbers had to wait for hours below the summit - both on the way up and on the way down. Many of them were exhausted and their oxygen cylinders were running low. Nepal's mountaineering regulation requires expedition teams to have liaison officers on the mountains. This time 59 of them were appointed to accompany the teams but only five of them stayed until the final part of the climb. Some did not even turn up, while most of those who did went home after a few days at the base camp. A photograph showing a long tailback went viral on the internet These are often regular government officials who have no mountaineering experience, so they find it difficult to cope with the high altitude. They get paid by expedition teams and most of them are happy to stay at home. If all the liaison officials had stayed on the mountain, managing the crowd would have been much easier, a top government source at Everest base camp told the BBC. ""We could have spread the teams so that the first feasible window (19-20 May) would have seen more climbers and the pressure would have been less during the second window,"" they said. ""Since almost none of these liaison officials stayed, it became very difficult for the limited officials to handle this huge number of climbers."" Liaison officials not turning up has been an issue ailing Nepal's mountaineering industry for years now. Meera Acharya, head of the mountaineering section at Nepal's tourism ministry, said 80% of the appointed officials did go to the base camp this time. ""But I admit that not all of our liaison officials stayed there for long. We are aware of this issue and we are working to address it."" ""We do hear of deaths of climbers on Mount Kilimanjaro as well, why is Everest being singled out here?"" Mountaineering experts say there is also an increase in the number of inexperienced climbers joining the growing crowd on Everest. This time round, many of them had just one Sherpa guide with their team, officials at the base camp said. ""When you have a dangerous situation like this, one Sherpa will not be able to help you much because he will have to take care of himself."" Nepal has denied overcrowding is the sole reason for the rise in deaths Some of the mountaineers who successfully returned after summiting said they had seen climbers struggling because they were running out of oxygen - they had to wait much longer. ""This new generation of climbers, eager to bag the top and brag back home, didn't know enough to understand the difference between climbing Everest and Makalu (Mount Makalu, the 5th highest peak southeast of Everest),"" says Alan Arnette, an experienced mountaineer and writer on mountaineering issues. ""They joined a random team of individuals with shared logistics for an independent climb. They didn't understand the word 'independent' and had no experience to evaluate the risks."" Veteran climbers have long suggested Nepal's government should introduce certain criteria, including mandatory experience of having climbed peaks above 6,000m, for issuing Everest climbing permits. The quest to get anyone willing to pay has been mainly down to intense competition between operators, particularly old and new ones. With the entry of new expedition operators offering cheaper prices, mountaineers say even some of the established ones have been forced to cut their fees. ""As a result, you see agencies hiring inexperienced people as guides who cannot offer the right guidance to their clients when they have a situation like this,"" said Tshering Pande Bhote, vice president of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. ""Unfortunately the competition is for volume and not for quality."" Expedition operators admit there are problems but they argue they also need to increase the number of visitors for the growth of the industry. ""Next year, for example, is Visit Nepal Year (a mega-tourism campaign that aims to bring in two million tourists),"" says Dambar Parajuli, president of the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal. ""So we will need to have more visitors, including mountaineers, but clearly how we manage traffic jams like this remains our major challenge."" How deadly is Mount Everest?

"A wealthy businessman who lived a life of luxury paid just Â£35.20 income tax, a BBC investigation has discovered. Frank Timis rented a Â£14,000-a-month penthouse and spent thousands dining in London's finest restaurants. But his personal tax return for 2017 shows he paid just Â£35.20 in tax, after claiming that he had hardly any income from his worldwide business empire. Mr Timis's lawyers say he has fully complied with all of his tax obligations. Documents leaked to BBC Panorama and Africa Eye also reveal how Mr Timis managed to do this. They show that in 2017, Mr Timis received payments totalling Â£670,000 from his offshore trust. These were mainly payments called distributions, which should have been taxable. But shortly before he submitted his tax return, Mr Timis allegedly asked the trust to turn the distributions into untaxable loans. A backdated loan agreement was created making the loans look legitimate. John Christiansen, from the Tax Justice Network, said it looked like Mr Timis was dodging tax: ""It all points to this being a manoeuvre to cheat the tax man.  And, if that is the case, because it's been done retrospectively, there seems to be prima facie evidence that this is tax fraud and it should be investigated."" The BBC investigation has also spoken to the man who ran the trust that helped Mr Timis with the apparent tax dodge. Philip Caldwell is named as chairman at the meeting in Switzerland that agreed to backdate the suspicious loans. His signature is on the minutes, but he says the meeting never happened and that the minutes of the meeting are fake: ""It has my signature on it but what I can say is that no such meeting ever took place. I wasn't there. I wasn't in Switzerland at the time."" The leaked documents also suggest that Mr Timis didn't pay a single penny in UK income tax in 2016. Mr Timis's lawyers say the allegations are denied in the strongest possible terms: ""Mr Timis has fully complied with all of his tax obligations and at all stages has taken professional advice to ensure that he has done so."" The Romanian businessman is no stranger to controversy. He has two convictions for supplying heroin in the 1990s and has been involved in a series of failed mining ventures in Africa. Frank Timis has floated two mining companies on the junior stock exchange in London. One of them - Regal Petroleum - washit with the exchange's biggest ever fine in 2009,externalafter misleading investors about an oil discovery. Regal Petroleum told investors it expected to find oil in Greece, even though it knew the well in question was dry. Mr Timis's lawyers said he only held a minority stake in Regal and was not on the board at the time the company received the fine. They said: ""Mr Timis was personally investigated and cleared by the FCA in relation to his role in Regal Petroleum.""

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"Donald Trump is making a much-delayed state visit to Britain this week. Over three days the US president will be hosted by royalty and politicians. He will also take part in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But behind the pageantry lie policy differences that divide Britain and the United States. Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing? Trump says Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader State visits are primarily royal affairs, with the emphasis as much on ceremony as politics. But even so, the potential for slip-ups is huge. Donald Trump made a mistake last year when he turned his back on the Queen and walked in front of her while inspecting the guard at Windsor Castle. This time there will be the tricky moment when he gives a speech at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Will he address the Queen correctly? Recently the White House mistakenly referred to her as ""Her Royal Majesty"". (Those who deal regularly with royalty would know that it should just be ""Her Majesty""). Will Mr Trump continue speaking during the National Anthem, as President Obama did in 2011? When Mr Trump has tea with the Prince of Wales at Clarence House, will they manage to avoid airing their rather different views on climate change? Mr Trump met the Queen when he visited the UK last year The president has no incentive to mess things up - he clearly likes the pomp and pageantry of royalty and will want the pictures to look good back home ahead of his re-election campaign. But there remains the question of how much advice he will take from his protocol team. The biggest potential flashpoint - in theory - could be the Duchess of Sussex who, in her past, pre-regal life, expressed opposition to Mr Trump's views.The US president told The Sun newspaper,externalhe was surprised Meghan had been so ""nasty"" about him. Perhaps fortuitously, the Duchess is still on maternity leave and will play no part in the visit. But it will not have gone unnoticed that an American citizen who only recently married into the British royal family - and thus epitomizes the close relationship between both countries - will not be part of the team welcoming her president to these shores. Mr Trump's visit comes at a tricky time politically for Britain. He will be visiting the lamest of lame duck prime ministers in the form of Theresa May who is standing down as Conservative leader at the end of the week. Britain is still gripped by the dread hand of the Brexit debate. In his Sun interview, the president criticised Mrs May for allowing the EU ""to have all the cards"" in the negotiations. And, in an interview published a day later, he told the Sunday Times the governmentshould bring in Nigel Farage- an arch critic of Mrs May - to help the Brexit negotiations. This week's visit is scheduled to include a joint news conference with Theresa May, something the pair did when he came to the UK last July Mr Trump had already expressed his support for Nigel Farage, saying the leader of the newly-formed Brexit Party was his friend, a ""big power"" in the UK and someone for whom he had a lot of respect. Will Mr Trump find time to meet Mr Farage? Downing Street has rejected the idea of there being an official meeting between the two, but might there be time for a quick cup of tea at Winfield House, the London residence of the US ambassador? Neither side are ruling it out. One minister told me this would be seen as both disappointing and rude. But Mr Trump rarely misses a chance to associate with like-minded politicians, if nothing else to emphasise what he sees as the growing success of his kind of politics. He will not mind that the two main opposition party leaders - Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Vince Cable - have refused their invitations to dine with him at the state banquet. Mr Trump also arrives in the middle of the Conservative leadership contest that will determine the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. He has already backed one candidate, the front-runner, Boris Johnson. The president told The Sun the former foreign secretary would be an excellent prime minister who would do ""a very good job"". On one hand, there will be some Conservative MPs and party members who will be impressed by this, welcoming the idea that a potential future prime minister already has a good relationship with a close ally. On the other, there may be some MPs who believe the unofficial endorsement from an unpopular US president might not endear Mr Johnson to the wider British electorate, which has more mixed feelings about Mr Trump. This video can not be played Trump: I like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage Remember that Mr Trump has already backed Mr Johnson, saying when he was in the UK last year that Mr Johnson - a former US citizen - would make ""a great prime minister"". Equally interesting would be any remarks Mr Trump chooses to make about the Labour leader, Mr Corbyn, who could one day be the person he meets for lunch in Downing Street, a leader who has made no secret of his hostility towards many US policies. Mr Trump told The Sun he was ""not offended"" by Mr Corbyn's refusal to attend the state banquet, saying: ""He is probably making a mistake because I think he would want to get along with the United States."" In a visit focused on ceremony and talks with an outgoing prime minister, the opportunity to discuss substantive policy will be, by necessity, constrained. But there will be much to disagree about in a trip that is supposed to emphasise unity. Take, for example, the Middle East. The British and US disagree about how best to change Iran's behaviour - the UK still supports the agreement designed to curb Tehran's nuclear programme, the US does not and is ready to sanction any British firm or bank that trades with Iran. The US has deployed a carrier strike force and B52 bombers to the region, something some British diplomats fear could provoke escalation, even war. Are these differences something Mr Trump will wish to raise in public? Is the United States heading for war with Iran? Trump: War would mean 'end of Iran' The president will also bring with him his adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is expected soon to announce the US so-called ""deal of the century"" to try to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The British government is concerned about any attempt to impose a unilateral plan that disposes of the two-state solution and seeks to buy off the Palestinians with hard cash. The Americans have already made it clear they are willing to press ahead without European support, just so long as they have the backing of one or two Arab states. Will any tough talking in Downing Street spill over into the news conference that follows? Let us not forget China. The growing confrontation between the US and China is worrying British policymakers, not just because of the potential impact on global economic growth. But there is also the not so minor matter of Huawei. The US is already angry at the decision - yet to be finalised - by British ministersto consider allowing the Chinese telecoms giant to build part of the UK's 5G mobile network. They fear this would potentially give the Chinese state access - via Huawei - to British and thus American secrets. Huawei: The world's most controversial company? Beijing defends Huawei amid 5G row US officials are warning that Mr Trump will not only raise this during the state visit but may even threaten to limit sharing intelligence with the UK as a result. Just consider what that might mean: the so-called ""special relationship"" has always had as a central core the sharing of intelligence - a relationship between security professionals that is supposed to be eternal, outside the squalls of political disagreement. So it would be hard for the president to praise UK-US relations while at the same time threatening to withhold intelligence. US officials say they are reassured that the UK decision on Huawei is not final and on hold until a new prime minister is elected. But they cannot rule out strong words on the subject from their president. Mr Trump, of course, once suggested that UK intelligence agencies were involved in a plot against his election - something they dismissed publicly as ridiculous nonsense.

Chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is Britain's third richest man, called it ""a major milestone that marks our first investment in the Middle East"". ""We are bringing advanced downstream technology which will add value and create further jobs in The Kingdom."" Fracking boss calls government 'pathetic' UK fracking firm urges rise in quake level Under the deal, Ineos will develop three chemical plants at Jubail 2, a $5bn petrochemicals complex run by Saudi Aramco and Total. It said the plants, which will begin production in 2025, would give it better access to markets in the Middle East and Asia. It follows its recent investments by the company in Belgium, China and the US. Ineos has also been holding exploratory fracking tests in Britain, but recently complained that tough regulations were making it unviable for firms. Sir Jim argued ministers had given in to a ""vocal"" minority of environmental campaigners, despite fracking being ""extremely safe and well proven"". In May, the pro-Brexit businessman also rejected reports about him allegedly leaving the UK to live in Monaco for tax purposes. The billionaire said Ineos had invested Â£2.5bn in the UK over the last 20 years, and that he had ""never made a penny of profit in the UK"". ""I have made lots of money in the US, Germany and Belgium, but am I supposed to go and live there? It's my private affair,"" he told the BBC.

"This video can not be played The 8.8cm sculpture is made of walrus ivory A medieval chess piece that was missing for almost 200 years had been unknowingly kept in a drawer by an Edinburgh family. They had no idea that the object was one of the long-lost Lewis Chessmen - which could now fetch Â£1m at auction. The chessmen were found on the Isle of Lewis in 1831 but the whereabouts of five pieces have remained a mystery. The Edinburgh family's grandfather, an antiques dealer, had bought the chess piece for Â£5 in 1964. He had no idea of the significance of the 8.8cm piece (3.5in), made from walrus ivory, which he passed down to his family. They have looked after it for 55 years without realising its importance, before taking it to Sotheby's auction house in London. The Lewis Chessmen are among the biggest draws at the British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. They are seen as an ""important symbol of European civilisation"" and have also seeped into popular culture, inspiring everything from children's show Noggin The Nog to part of the plot in Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone. Sotheby's expert Alexander Kader, who examined the piece for the family, said his ""jaw dropped"" when he realised what they had in their possession. ""They brought it in for assessment,"" he said. ""That happens every day. Our doors are open for free valuations. ""We get called down to the counter and have no idea what we are going to see. More often than not, it's not worth very much. ""I said, 'Oh my goodness, it's one of the Lewis Chessmen'."" Call for community buyouts of ancient treasures Lewis Chessmen recreated in Lego Mr Kader, Sotheby's co-worldwide head of European sculpture and works of art, said the family, who want to remain anonymous, were ""quite amazed"". ""It's a little bit bashed up. It has lost its left eye. But that kind of weather-beaten, weary warrior added to its charm,"" he said. Despite not knowing its significance, the late 12th/early 13th Century chess piece had been ""treasured"" by the family. The current owner's late mother believed it ""almost had magical qualities"". A family spokesman said in a statement: ""My grandfather was an antiques dealer based in Edinburgh, and in 1964 he purchased an ivory chessman from another Edinburgh dealer. ""It was catalogued in his purchase ledger that he had bought an 'Antique Walrus Tusk Warrior Chessman'. The chessmen are thought to have been made in Scandinavia, possibly Norway ""From this description it can be assumed that he was unaware he had purchased an important historic artefact. ""It was stored away in his home and then when my grandfather died my mother inherited the chess piece. ""My mother was very fond of the Chessman as she admired its intricacy and quirkiness. She believed that it was special and thought perhaps it could even have had some magical significance. ""For many years it resided in a drawer in her home where it had been carefully wrapped in a small bag. From time to time, she would remove the chess piece from the drawer in order to appreciate its uniqueness."" The Lewis Chessmen set includes seated kings and queens, bishops, knights and standing warders and pawns. Some 82 pieces are now in the British Museum and 11 pieces held by the National Museum of Scotland. As well as the chess pieces, the hoard includes 14 ""tablemen"" gaming pieces and a buckle. Since the hoard was uncovered in 1831, one knight and four warders have been missing from the four combined chess sets. The newly-discovered piece is a warder, a man with helmet, shield and sword and the equivalent of a rook on a modern chess board, which ""has immense character and power"". The Lewis Chessmen were found on the Isle of Lewis in 1831 but the whereabouts of five pieces have remained a mystery The discovery of the hoard remains shrouded in mystery, with stories of it being dug up by a cow grazing on sandy banks. It is thought it was buried shortly after the objects were made, possibly by a merchant to avoid taxes after being shipwrecked, and so remained underground for 500 years. Mr Kader, who has kept the discovery under wraps for six months while authenticating the find, said: ""We can safely say that a million pounds will transform the seller's life."" He added: ""There are still four out there somewhere. It might take another 150 years for another one to pop up."" The object will go on display in Edinburgh on Tuesday and in London just before the auction on 2 July, with Mr Kader saying it could be bought by, or be loaned to, a museum.

"A wealthy businessman who lived a life of luxury paid just Â£35.20 income tax, a BBC investigation has discovered. Frank Timis rented a Â£14,000-a-month penthouse and spent thousands dining in London's finest restaurants. But his personal tax return for 2017 shows he paid just Â£35.20 in tax, after claiming that he had hardly any income from his worldwide business empire. Mr Timis's lawyers say he has fully complied with all of his tax obligations. Documents leaked to BBC Panorama and Africa Eye also reveal how Mr Timis managed to do this. They show that in 2017, Mr Timis received payments totalling Â£670,000 from his offshore trust. These were mainly payments called distributions, which should have been taxable. But shortly before he submitted his tax return, Mr Timis allegedly asked the trust to turn the distributions into untaxable loans. A backdated loan agreement was created making the loans look legitimate. John Christiansen, from the Tax Justice Network, said it looked like Mr Timis was dodging tax: ""It all points to this being a manoeuvre to cheat the tax man.  And, if that is the case, because it's been done retrospectively, there seems to be prima facie evidence that this is tax fraud and it should be investigated."" The BBC investigation has also spoken to the man who ran the trust that helped Mr Timis with the apparent tax dodge. Philip Caldwell is named as chairman at the meeting in Switzerland that agreed to backdate the suspicious loans. His signature is on the minutes, but he says the meeting never happened and that the minutes of the meeting are fake: ""It has my signature on it but what I can say is that no such meeting ever took place. I wasn't there. I wasn't in Switzerland at the time."" The leaked documents also suggest that Mr Timis didn't pay a single penny in UK income tax in 2016. Mr Timis's lawyers say the allegations are denied in the strongest possible terms: ""Mr Timis has fully complied with all of his tax obligations and at all stages has taken professional advice to ensure that he has done so."" The Romanian businessman is no stranger to controversy. He has two convictions for supplying heroin in the 1990s and has been involved in a series of failed mining ventures in Africa. Frank Timis has floated two mining companies on the junior stock exchange in London. One of them - Regal Petroleum - washit with the exchange's biggest ever fine in 2009,externalafter misleading investors about an oil discovery. Regal Petroleum told investors it expected to find oil in Greece, even though it knew the well in question was dry. Mr Timis's lawyers said he only held a minority stake in Regal and was not on the board at the time the company received the fine. They said: ""Mr Timis was personally investigated and cleared by the FCA in relation to his role in Regal Petroleum.""

"This video can not be played Gunfire can be heard as protesters flee Sudanese security forces have attacked a pro-democracy protest outside the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, activists say. Gunfire can be heard in video footage, with medical sources saying at least 13 people were killed and dozens hurt. Sudan has been governed by a Transitional Military Council (TMC) since President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in a coup in April. The council denied the main protest site had been broken up using force. The leaders of the protest movement, who demand that a civilian government take over the running of the country, said they were stopping all contact with the military and called a general strike. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is close to the protesters, said 13 people had been killed and that there was a ""large number of critical casualties"". Activists say the security services moved on the main protest site early on Monday. But TMC spokesman, Lt Gen Shams al-Din Kabbashi, said the security forces had moved towards a location near the main protest site which had ""long been a hotbed of corruption and negative practices"". ""Sudanese forces did not disperse the sit-in outside the army headquarters by force, but rather targeted a nearby area which has become a threat to the safety of citizens,"" he told UAE-based Sky News Arabia TV channel. Africa Live: Updates from Khartoum How protesters keep going during Ramadan The art fuelling Sudan's revolution 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' ""The tents are still there and the youth are moving there freely,"" he added, saying that many protesters had ""preferred to leave the sit-in"". Protesters set ablaze tyres to try to stop Sudan's security forces The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which is spearheading nationwide protests, said it was suspending all communication with the TMC, calling for a campaign of ""sweeping civil disobedience to topple the treacherous and killer military council"". Journalist Benjamin Strick, who specialises in verifying footage on Twitter, has shared dramatic videos from Khartoum, where repeated gunfire could be heard. Allow Twitter content?

Some Khartoum residents blame the notorious paramilitary unit known as the Rapid Support Forces. It was set up to help keep Mr Bashir in power and has its roots in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, which began in 2003. Then known as the ""janjaweed"", this militia carried out frequent massacres. Meanwhile, the US embassy in Sudan said attacks by Sudanese security forces on protesters must stop.

Speaking to the BBC, the UK Ambassador to Sudan, Irfan Siddiq, described it as a ""hugely worrying and negative development"", and that he was woken by the sound of heavy gunfire. ""I feared that this is what many had been warning of for some time, that there would be an attempt by the security forces to forcibly disperse the protest site, and it seems that's what's happened now, with a lot of casualties."" The African Union has strongly condemned the violence, calling for an immediate and transparent investigation. Analysis by Tomi Oladipo, BBC's Africa security correspondent It is back to square one for Sudan's political process. The hardening stances that stalled the talks between the protest groups and the TMC have been further cemented on both sides. Expect more resolute protests and a possibly even more ruthless crackdown from the men in uniform. It is the latter who are governing right now. What matters is which faction of the security forces has the upper hand in the TMC. The hardliners, particularly the Rapid Support Forces - led by the deputy head of the regime, Mohamed ""Hemeti"" Hamdan Dagalo - appear to be leading the way and could display more ruthlessness than has been seen so far. There has been a total lockdown in Khartoum, indicating something has shifted within the regime. ""People power"" is taking a big hit, but protesters could be willing to take greater risks to force the military's hand, if possible. The demonstrators have been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, five days before Mr Bashir was overthrown. Sudanese security forces have been seen deploying around Khartoum's army headquarters Last month, organisers and the ruling generals announced they had agreed on the structure of a new administration and a three-year transition period to civilian rule. But they still need to decide on the make-up of what has been called the sovereign council, which will be the highest decision-making body in the transition period. They cannot agree on whether civilians or the military should have the majority of positions. 19 December 2018 - Protests erupt after fuel and bread price rises announced 22 February 2019 - President Bashir dissolves the government 24 February - Protests continue as security forces respond by firing live bullets 6 April - Activists begin sit-in at military headquarters, vowing not to move until Mr Bashir steps down 11 April - army generals announce that Mr Bashir has been toppled but sit-in continues as people demand civilian rule 20 April - Talks between the military rulers and civilian representatives begin 13 May - Shooting outside the military headquarters leaves six people dead 14 May - Military and civilians announce a deal on a three-year transition period 16 May - Talks postponed as military demands some barricades are removed 3 June - Activists announce the suspension of talks with the military, accusing them of using force to disperse their sit-in Are you in the area?

"This month hospitals have reported huge pressures, with A&Es over-crowded, a lack of beds and queues of ambulances stacked up outside unable to hand over their patients. It was a similar story last winter. The NHS, it seems, is always facing unrelenting pressure. But why is this when funding is rising? The sheer scale of the health service can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. So it should come as no surprise that this vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year in excess of Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during years of deep austerity in the UK, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving, 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering below the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was considerably higher. As you can see the period between 2010 and 2015 saw the tightest financial settlement. The following two years were a little more generous, but that average is likely to drop a little over the rest of the parliament under current spending plans. So ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC last year is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by over 40% in 13 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this by placing more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years for which we have data, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£70 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Ministers in England have promised the system will change. New plans are due to be published by the summer of 2018. But, as yet, no part of the UK has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

"Sir Jim Ratcliffe is the UK's third richest man UK energy firm Ineos is to invest $2bn (Â£1.6bn) in building its first ever manufacturing plants in Saudi Arabia. It follows an agreement with the Kingdom's state oil company Saudi Aramco and French energy firm Total. Ineos said the facilities would produce chemicals for sectors such as automotive, aerospace and electronics. Chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is Britain's third richest man, called it ""a major milestone that marks our first investment in the Middle East"". ""We are bringing advanced downstream technology which will add value and create further jobs in The Kingdom."" Fracking boss calls government 'pathetic' UK fracking firm urges rise in quake level Under the deal, Ineos will develop three chemical plants at Jubail 2, a $5bn petrochemicals complex run by Saudi Aramco and Total. It said the plants, which will begin production in 2025, would give it better access to markets in the Middle East and Asia. It follows its recent investments by the company in Belgium, China and the US. Ineos has also been holding exploratory fracking tests in Britain, but recently complained that tough regulations were making it unviable for firms. Sir Jim argued ministers had given in to a ""vocal"" minority of environmental campaigners, despite fracking being ""extremely safe and well proven"". In May, the pro-Brexit businessman also rejected reports about him allegedly leaving the UK to live in Monaco for tax purposes. The billionaire said Ineos had invested Â£2.5bn in the UK over the last 20 years, and that he had ""never made a penny of profit in the UK"". ""I have made lots of money in the US, Germany and Belgium, but am I supposed to go and live there? It's my private affair,"" he told the BBC. Correction 3 June 2019: A previous version of this article was headlinedIneos director: TV chef attack on plastic 'pretty pathetic'and reported comments made by Tom Crotty, a director of Ineos, in an interview on theToday programme. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has since tweeted that Ineos""have been misled by some inaccurate reporting"",external.

As well as winning a slot performing in front of the Queen at the Royal Variety Performance, he will also bank a cheque for Â£250,000. The 89-year-old singer said he would make a donation to the south London retirement and nursing home for former members of the British Army. He admitted he had taken part in the programme ""for a dare"". ""One of the guys, as I was coming off the stage in our club dared me having sung after the curry lunch,"" explained Thackery, who is from Thorpe St Andrew in Norwich, on Britain's Got More Talent. ""He said, 'When are going to do it?' I said, 'What?' and he said 'Go on Britain's Got Talent'. I said ''Don't be silly'."" Allow YouTube content?

After performing Love Changes Everything for the finale on Sunday night, Thackeray said he would ""die happy"" if he had the chance to sing for the Queen. ""I served my Queen for 25 years and to think I could sing for her would be the end,"" he told hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. According to overnight figures, an average 8.2 million people tuned in live to Sunday night's final, a 40% share of the audience. That figure rises to 8.5 million when those watching on ITV+1 are included. In 2018, an average of8.7 million viewers tuned in live to watch Lost Voice Guywin the competition, the highest figures since 2015 when dancing dog act Jules O'Dwyer & Matisse were crowned. When the show launched in 2007,more than 11 million watched opera singer Paul Potts crowned its first winnerwhile an audience of 16.4 million saw Diversity dance their way to success in 2009, with 18.29 million tuning in for the results show. The viewing environment has altered dramatically over the past decade. So BGT's overnight audience of 8.5 million is a strong performance at a time when watching patterns are constantly changing. While the talent show is no longer enjoying the huge dominance it had ten years ago, Sunday night's figures still represent the show's biggest overnight audience for a final since 2015. This weekend has also seen some notable viewing figures withSaturday night's Champions League Finalgiving BT Sport its biggest ever overnight rating, peaking at more than 6 million viewers. Along with Game of Thrones on Sky Atlantic, it's an additional example of how a particularly popular piece of programming can draw large audiences away from the traditional big broadcasters. The BBC's Line of Duty series five finale is, so far 2019's most watched piece of television There's still lots of good news around for the likes of BBC One and ITV. The final 28 day viewing figures for the May finale of BBC One's Line of Duty (above) have now been published. It's been watched by 13.67 million, including catch-up platforms, making it 2019's most watched piece of television. It joins a small select group of shows, major sporting events aside, that can still achieve figures in excess of 13 million. Over the past year, these have included writer Jed Mercurio's other big BBC drama Bodyguard, Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Masked Magician X was the runner-up and shocked the judges and audience by revealing he was actually former contestant Marc Spelmann, who appeared in the 2018 series but failed to make it to the final. Spelman's big reveal was preceded by a video montage of his previous performances during which Ant is seen saying: ""Imagine at the end he takes it off and it's someone we know?"" Close to tears, he told the audience: ""It was always about hope. I'm never giving up. It's been an honour sharing X with you. I'm X,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

"Rory Stewart's social media videos have been widely shared in the last week The last contested Conservative leadership race took place in 2005. Back then Facebook was only one-year-old and Twitter did not exist. Yet, in the last seven days several of the Tories vying to become the next prime minister have released videos on social media. Their contrasting styles show how the internet is changing how politicians communicate, and how quickly this field is changing. Party political broadcasts have been around for decades. The first took place back in 1924 on BBC radio but techniques have changed a lot since then - and further still in the last few years. Radio broadcasts began in 1924 when Stanley Baldwin was elected Conservative Prime Minister Craig Dillon is the founder of communications agency Westminster Digital which has in the past made videos for several of the Tory leadership candidates. Video captions are essential on social media videos, he says, because 85% of people watch the videos with the sound turned off. On TV or radio there is a chance to build context before setting out a message, but attention spans are shorter online. ""The first 10 seconds are really key"", says Dillon. ""You have to use tactics to catch people's eye."" One candidate, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, caught people's eye this week with a quirky head turn at the start of his launch video.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove's launch video is similar to Raab's some respects - it features a smartly-dressed piece-to-camera, and fast-paced stock footage. It also has a clip of Gove criticising Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons earlier this year - with good reason. The Conservative's YouTube channel has not had many smash hits recently, but the full video of that Gove speech has racked up more than 700,000 views since January. Allow YouTube content?

Home Secretary Sajid Javid set out his pitch this week in a wood-panelled office - all fairly conventional. But 10 seconds in, there is a subtle nod to a new media age - a wobbly shot from a side angle. This seems peculiar from a conventional broadcast perspective. But this technique has become mainstream in recent weeks after the Brexit Party used this style extensively in European election campaign videos. Allow Twitter content?

In 2017 theparty spent far less than the Conservatives on social mediabut their content was shared far more widely. Five new things about online campaigning Ivory, the election and social media Who spent what on Facebook at 2017 election? Parties constantly borrow from each other to try to catch up in the race to go viral. Edington admits a Brexit Party video criticising Jeremy Corbyn's party was deliberately shot in a style similar to Labour's own videos. ""Labour does some fantastic emotional videos... some of their videos are very powerful,"" Edington says. ""We used Labour's own style to show that - their very slow emotional music.""

This video can not be played Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrates her win with supporters Although no Tories have matched her production levels yet, most videos look fairly slick. But there is one exception - International Development Secretary Rory Stewart. A brief selfie video of Stewart offering to speak to members of the public in Kew Gardens has had 1.5m views on Twitter even though it has no captions. When a BuzzFeed journalist cheekily asked Stewart ""are you pretending to hold your phone"" the minister replied ""yes"". The shot is very stable, suggesting it was filmed on a tripod - but Stewart's admission is disarming and helps feed an image of authenticity. Allow Twitter content?

BBC Sport presenter Gary Lineker is a strident opponent of Brexit on social media and generally unsympathetic to the Conservatives. But this week he approvingly shared with his 7.3m followers an interview in which Rory Stewart criticised the idea of a no-deal Brexit. Stewart's interview with JOE, a website aimed at young men, now has 1.8m Twitter views - in large part surely due to Lineker's clout. However only a tiny fraction of the people watching these videos will get a say in replacing Theresa May. Under the party's rules, Conservative MPs narrow the field down to two candidates, then party members decide. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might? BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Last time the Conservative Party released membership figures there were just 124,000 of these - and  two-thirds of them want a no-deal Brexit, according to a recent YouGov poll. That suggests Rory Stewart's campaign might do well online, but not be the right message to win his party's leadership. Many Tory members will be awaiting the next move of a candidate who has managed to dominate the online conversation despite laying low on social media this week.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonny Dymond on what to expect from President Trump's visit to the UK US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are making a state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Here's a rundown of what we can expect. It's a formal trip to the UK by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. Although they're grand occasions, they're not just ceremonial affairs - they're also used by the government to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state per year and has hosted 112 of these visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Familyhas a full list of all the other state visits,external, and details ofhow the ceremonies unfold,external. Visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, but because Buckingham Palace is being renovated the US president is not expected to stay there. While Mr Trump is only the third US president to make a state visit to the UK, the Queenhas met almost all the US presidents in office during that time, either in the UK or in the US. On Monday, the first day of Mr Trump's three-day trip, a ceremonial welcome attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall was held in the Buckingham Palace garden. After the welcome, the Duke of Sussex joined the group for a private lunch at the palace. This video can not be played Here's what happened on day one of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK (tweets not included). Mr and Mrs Trump then visited Westminster Abbey for a tour and met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea at Clarence House. Astate banquet in the palace's ballroom took place on Monday evening, with Mr Trump, the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with other UK public figures and prominent Americans living in Britain. The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May will host a business breakfast attended by the Duke of York at St James's Palace. Business leaders understood to be attending include Barclays CEO Jes Staley, GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Emma Walmsley, BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and the National Grid's John Pettigrew. Mr Trump will then visit Downing Street for talks with Theresa May. They are expected to discuss a range of issues on which they hold differing views - includingclimate changeandHuawei. Trump visit: A barometer of political power The talks will be followed by a joint press conference. Mrs May is due to step down as prime minister on 7 June. Thousands of people are expected to join protests against Mr Trump's visit in UK cities on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the London rally in Trafalgar Square, where he will be joined by members of other political parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. In the evening, the Trumps will host a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador attended by Charles and Camilla on behalf of the Queen. The trip is expected to culminate on Wednesday 5 June with Mr Trump, the Queen and Prince Charles attending the national commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. More than 300 veterans will be at the ceremony, which will feature musical performances, testimonial readings and military displays. Trump visit 'will detract from D-Day event' Following the D-Day event Mr Trump will travel to his hotel and golf resort in Doonbeg, in the Republic of Ireland. He will hold a meeting with Irish premier Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport. A visiting leader will sometimes speak at the Houses of Parliament during a state visit, but Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Tuesday he had not received a request for Mr Trump to do so. The president has suggested he ""may"" meet Conservative MP and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage during his visit -both of whom he described as ""friends"" and ""good guys"". The prime minister says the visit is a chance for the UK and the US to strengthen their ""already close relationship"". Talks will cover areas such as trade, investment, security and defence. But Mr Trump is a controversial figure and many have opposed the visit. Thousands gathered to protest against President Trump's policies when he visited the UK in 2018 His policies - from the executive order that restricts entry to the US from certain countries, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - have provoked criticism, both domestically and internationally. And that is to say nothing about some of the comments he's made - including outspoken attacks against political opponents, the media, and his critics - and the investigation into his links to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also declined an invitation. Others argue that the US is a key ally of the UK and that Mr Trump should be welcomed accordingly. When the president's on the move - you know about it The security operation surrounding Mr Trump's visit could cost more than Â£18m. It is intended to createan impenetrable ring of steelaround the US president. The president arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, with space for conference and dining rooms and a medical facility with an operating table. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines nicknamed The Beast and other security and communications vehicles, was flown across ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. In 2018, almost 10,000 officers from the UK were deployed for Mr Trump's trip, with nearly every force in the country providing staff to support the operation. This video can not be played Dinner, talks and golf: A look back at President Trump's last visit to the UK It was certainly eventful. As well as holding talks with Mrs May at her country residence, Chequers, and having tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle, the trip was marked by demonstrations. Tens of thousands of peoplegathered in central London to protest against him. There was also a six-metre ""Trump baby"" blimp - depicting the president as a nappy-wearing infant - inflated outside Parliament. And at his golf resort at Turnberry, Ayrshire,one protester paraglided over the hotelas Mr Trump played the course. Campaigners have claimed they will mobilise ""huge numbers"" in response to Mr Trump's arrival. On Monday supporters of the human rights charity Amnesty unfurled five banners facing the US embassy on Vauxhall Bridge, reading ""Resist sexism"", ""Resist racism"", ""Resist hate"", ""Resist cruelty"" and ""Resist Trump"". A ""national demonstration"" in London's Trafalgar Square will start at 11:00 BST on Tuesday, while protests are also planned in Birmingham, Stoke, Sheffield, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Chester, Leicester, Oxford and Exeter. A 16ft talking robot of Mr Trump sitting on a golden toilet is also expected to make an appearance. Trump visit: A barometer of power Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

"Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail group is facing a crucial week, with creditors set to vote on his proposed restructuring plans on Wednesday. If landlords and the Pensions Regulator do not back his proposals to shut stores and cut rents, the High Street giant could go into administration. Nearly 50 UK shops are due to close and MPs want him to use his own wealth to fund the firm's pension scheme. Arcadia chains include Topshop, Burton, Wallis, and Dorothy Perkins. The measures are seen as a final effort by the company, which is losing out to online rivals, to stave off administration or breakup. Arcadia currently has more than 560 shops across the UK and Ireland, and employs 22,000 staff. The firm initially announced 23 stores would close as part of the rescue deal, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). Then it emerged that a further 25 stores would shut, under separate insolvency proceedings. That second round of closures will mainly affect plus size clothing chain Evans, as well as six Miss Selfridge stores. Closures will include Evans and Miss Selfridge shops The latest closures add to the 200 UK stores shut over the past three years. Under the CVA, the retail giant is also seeking to halve contributions to its pension funds - which have a deficit of Â£750m - to Â£25m each year. But Sir Philip's wife, Lady Tina Green, who is Arcadia's main shareholder, has offered to inject an extra Â£100m into the schemes over the next three years. However, the Pensions Regulator - which has the power to block the CVA - has said it has doubts the plans will ""adequately protect"" the pensions of employees. And MP Frank Field, chair of the Commons' Work and Pensions Committee, has urged Sir Philip to use his own money to support the pension fund of his troubled group. The retail tycoon is also seeking rent reductions on nearly 200 shops, and to sweeten the pill he has offered landlords a 20% stake of any proceeds if the group is eventually sold. But a number are pushing for changes to the proposals. For the agreement to go ahead, Arcadia must win approval from three quarters of its creditors, which include landlords, creditors and the company's pension trustees. Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC it was ""hard to tell"" if the CVA would pass. ""There are big questions over whether Green can make Arcadia a viable business after years of underinvestment. ""He's also had run-ins with his landlords and the Pension Regulator in the past. Now he's asking them to believe in him, and it's a big ask."" But Richard Lim, head of Retail Economics, said landlords had little choice but to back the deal. ""Arcadia has a huge presence on the High Street, and in many places landlords will think, 'who is going to fill this space if they aren't here?'"" The retail group also plans to shut all of its 11 Topshop and Topman stores in the US. Separately, last week Sir Philip was charged in the US with four counts of misdemeanour assault. The charges come after a fitness instructor in Arizona alleged that he repeatedly touched her inappropriately. Sir Philip denies the claims.

"This video can not be played Gunfire can be heard as protesters flee Sudanese security forces have attacked a pro-democracy protest outside the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, activists say. Gunfire can be heard in video footage, with medical sources saying at least 13 people were killed and dozens hurt. Sudan has been governed by a Transitional Military Council (TMC) since President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in a coup in April. The council denied the main protest site had been broken up using force. The leaders of the protest movement, who demand that a civilian government take over the running of the country, said they were stopping all contact with the military and called a general strike. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is close to the protesters, said 13 people had been killed and that there was a ""large number of critical casualties"". Activists say the security services moved on the main protest site early on Monday. But TMC spokesman, Lt Gen Shams al-Din Kabbashi, said the security forces had moved towards a location near the main protest site which had ""long been a hotbed of corruption and negative practices"". ""Sudanese forces did not disperse the sit-in outside the army headquarters by force, but rather targeted a nearby area which has become a threat to the safety of citizens,"" he told UAE-based Sky News Arabia TV channel. Africa Live: Updates from Khartoum How protesters keep going during Ramadan The art fuelling Sudan's revolution 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' ""The tents are still there and the youth are moving there freely,"" he added, saying that many protesters had ""preferred to leave the sit-in"". Protesters set ablaze tyres to try to stop Sudan's security forces The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which is spearheading nationwide protests, said it was suspending all communication with the TMC, calling for a campaign of ""sweeping civil disobedience to topple the treacherous and killer military council"". Journalist Benjamin Strick, who specialises in verifying footage on Twitter, has shared dramatic videos from Khartoum, where repeated gunfire could be heard. Allow Twitter content?

Some Khartoum residents blame the notorious paramilitary unit known as the Rapid Support Forces. It was set up to help keep Mr Bashir in power and has its roots in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, which began in 2003. Then known as the ""janjaweed"", this militia carried out frequent massacres. Meanwhile, the US embassy in Sudan said attacks by Sudanese security forces on protesters must stop.

Speaking to the BBC, the UK Ambassador to Sudan, Irfan Siddiq, described it as a ""hugely worrying and negative development"", and that he was woken by the sound of heavy gunfire. ""I feared that this is what many had been warning of for some time, that there would be an attempt by the security forces to forcibly disperse the protest site, and it seems that's what's happened now, with a lot of casualties."" The African Union has strongly condemned the violence, calling for an immediate and transparent investigation. Analysis by Tomi Oladipo, BBC's Africa security correspondent It is back to square one for Sudan's political process. The hardening stances that stalled the talks between the protest groups and the TMC have been further cemented on both sides. Expect more resolute protests and a possibly even more ruthless crackdown from the men in uniform. It is the latter who are governing right now. What matters is which faction of the security forces has the upper hand in the TMC. The hardliners, particularly the Rapid Support Forces - led by the deputy head of the regime, Mohamed ""Hemeti"" Hamdan Dagalo - appear to be leading the way and could display more ruthlessness than has been seen so far. There has been a total lockdown in Khartoum, indicating something has shifted within the regime. ""People power"" is taking a big hit, but protesters could be willing to take greater risks to force the military's hand, if possible. The demonstrators have been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, five days before Mr Bashir was overthrown. Sudanese security forces have been seen deploying around Khartoum's army headquarters Last month, organisers and the ruling generals announced they had agreed on the structure of a new administration and a three-year transition period to civilian rule. But they still need to decide on the make-up of what has been called the sovereign council, which will be the highest decision-making body in the transition period. They cannot agree on whether civilians or the military should have the majority of positions. 19 December 2018 - Protests erupt after fuel and bread price rises announced 22 February 2019 - President Bashir dissolves the government 24 February - Protests continue as security forces respond by firing live bullets 6 April - Activists begin sit-in at military headquarters, vowing not to move until Mr Bashir steps down 11 April - army generals announce that Mr Bashir has been toppled but sit-in continues as people demand civilian rule 20 April - Talks between the military rulers and civilian representatives begin 13 May - Shooting outside the military headquarters leaves six people dead 14 May - Military and civilians announce a deal on a three-year transition period 16 May - Talks postponed as military demands some barricades are removed 3 June - Activists announce the suspension of talks with the military, accusing them of using force to disperse their sit-in Are you in the area?

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"This video can not be played The Queen: ""I am confident our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us"". President Donald Trump has praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US as he joined a state banquet at Buckingham Palace. The Queen said the countries were celebrating an alliance which had ensured the ""safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades"". The president is in the UK for a three-day state visit, which includes the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Earlier in the day,Mr Trump criticised the mayor of London. Hetweeted that Sadiq Khan,external- who had saidthe UK should ""not roll out the red carpet"",externalfor Mr Trump - was a ""stone cold loser"". But in his speech at the banquet, Mr Trump praised the courage of the British people during World War Two and called the Queen a ""great, great woman"". ""In that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,"" he said, adding that their bravery ensured that the destiny of the country ""remained in your own hands"". Mr Trump ended his speech with a toast to ""the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations and to the long-cherished and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty the Queen"". The Queen praised the two countries' role in creating an assembly of international institutions that would ensure ""the horrors of conflict would never be repeated"". On Twitter before the banquet, Mr Trumppraised the welcome,externalfrom the Royal Family as ""fantastic"" and said the relationship with the UK is ""very strong"". He also saida post-Brexit trade deal could happen,externalonce the UK removed the ""shackles"", adding: ""Already starting to talk!"" Latest updates on President Trump's first day in UK In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK Trump's UK visit: What's he bringing? Large-scale protests are planned in several UK cities during the three-day visit, including in London, where a ""national demonstration"" will start at Trafalgar Square at 11:00 on Tuesday. The Duchess of Cambridge was escorted into the banquet by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace The American national anthem was played and Mr Trump was invited to inspect the guard of honour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who boycotted the state dinner - is due to attend and speak at the London demonstration, a party spokesman has confirmed. Earlier,Mr Corbyn tweeted,external: ""Tomorrow's protest against Donald Trump's state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he's attacked in America, around the world and in our own country - including, just this morning, Sadiq Khan."" Mr Trump's tweet about Mr Khan accused him of doing a ""terrible job"" as mayor, adding: ""[He] has been foolishly ""nasty"" to the visiting president of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me."" By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The contrast could not have been starker. The President of the United States received a warm welcome from the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace. There were two 41-gun salutes - one for Mr Trump and another marking the 66th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on Sunday - as well as an honour guard of young Grenadiers resplendent in scarlet. At the same time, Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on the mayor of the city in which he is now a guest, calling Sadiq Khan ""a stone cold loser"" for questioning why the president had been granted a state visit. In truth, this is all of a piece for Mr Trump: he gets the pictures and the pageantry that he wants and will look good in his re-election campaign next year, and he gets to pick a fight with a liberal, Muslim politician that will play well with his base. Already this row is forcing those campaigning to be Britain's prime minister to define themselves against Mr Trump. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised Mr Khan for his ""great discourtesy"". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the office of the mayor of London should be respected in the same way one respects the office of the president. This visit has only just begun and already the Great Disruptor is tweeting angry thoughts and breaching diplomatic niceties. Business as usual, you might think - only today he also happens to be a guest of the Queen, who rarely tweets and is always diplomatic. A spokesman for Mr Khan said ""childish insults"" should be beneath the US president, adding: ""Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country, warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe."" House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also boycotted the state banquet. Trump's visit: A barometer of political power Trump denies calling Meghan Markle 'nasty' Trump visit divides crowds at the palace The Duchess of Sussex did not attend following the birth of her son Archie, who is less than a month old. On Sunday, Mr Trumpdenied calling the duchess ""nasty"", despite him using the word on tape. But the guests included the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as well as prominent Americans living in Britain. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall posed with their visitors in the morning room at Clarence House The president and first lady were given a tour of Westminster Abbey by the Dean of Westminster The US president made his mark in the distinguished visitors' book at Westminster Abbey As he stepped onto UK soil at Stansted Airport, Mr Trump was greeted by US Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Tory leadership candidate Mr Hunt, who has spoken about the importance of the UK's relationship with the US, said Mr Trump mentioned to him ""some of his very strong views about the mayor of London"". Crowds were gathered outside Buckingham Palace as the president and first lady landed by helicopter shortly after midday.

He was also given a three-piece Duofold pen set decorated with an EIIR emblem, in a design made exclusively for the monarch. Mrs Trump received a specially commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid, decorated in royal blue with roses, thistles and shamrocks to represent the ceiling of Buckingham Palace's music room. After the private lunch, the Queen showed the couple American artefacts and other items from the Royal Collection. In a nod to the US leader's Scottish heritage, he was shown a bolt of Harris tweed.

The president signed the distinguished visitor's book in his customary black marker pen, describing the 13th Century church as a ""special place"". Their next stop was Clarence House, where they joined Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea. By Hamish Mackay, BBC News A quick walk around the crowd outside Buckingham Palace revealed the presence of supporters and detractors of Mr Trump - both equally strong in their views. Phillip Butah, from Essex, wearing a MAGA hat and describing himself and his companion as ""Trump activists"", says: ""We are so happy that he's here - this visit is long overdue."" Asked what they expect the UK to get from this visit, they reply: ""Trade deals."" Corey Wright, a 25-year-old American from Ohio, in London as a tourist, sees the visit in a similar light. ""I think the visit is good for the political environment,"" he says. ""I think that needs to be worked on and that's what he's here to do."" Auriel Granville - a climate activist from Wimbledon, south-west London - came dressed as the Statue of Liberty to protest against the president's visit. ""I don't think he should be received in this way - climate change should be top of our agenda and Donald Trump is a climate change denier,"" she said. Read more about the crowds outside the palace Talks between Mr Trump and outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May will begin on Tuesday. Although Mr Trump has spoken of his admiration for Mrs May, there are expected to be differences of opinion during their talks. The prime minister willraise the issue of climate change, with a government spokesman again saying on Monday the UK was ""disappointed by the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017"".

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"Donald Trump is making a much-delayed state visit to Britain this week. Over three days the US president will be hosted by royalty and politicians. He will also take part in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But behind the pageantry lie policy differences that divide Britain and the United States. Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing? Trump says Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader State visits are primarily royal affairs, with the emphasis as much on ceremony as politics. But even so, the potential for slip-ups is huge. Donald Trump made a mistake last year when he turned his back on the Queen and walked in front of her while inspecting the guard at Windsor Castle. This time there will be the tricky moment when he gives a speech at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Will he address the Queen correctly? Recently the White House mistakenly referred to her as ""Her Royal Majesty"". (Those who deal regularly with royalty would know that it should just be ""Her Majesty""). Will Mr Trump continue speaking during the National Anthem, as President Obama did in 2011? When Mr Trump has tea with the Prince of Wales at Clarence House, will they manage to avoid airing their rather different views on climate change? Mr Trump met the Queen when he visited the UK last year The president has no incentive to mess things up - he clearly likes the pomp and pageantry of royalty and will want the pictures to look good back home ahead of his re-election campaign. But there remains the question of how much advice he will take from his protocol team. The biggest potential flashpoint - in theory - could be the Duchess of Sussex who, in her past, pre-regal life, expressed opposition to Mr Trump's views.The US president told The Sun newspaper,externalhe was surprised Meghan had been so ""nasty"" about him. Perhaps fortuitously, the Duchess is still on maternity leave and will play no part in the visit. But it will not have gone unnoticed that an American citizen who only recently married into the British royal family - and thus epitomizes the close relationship between both countries - will not be part of the team welcoming her president to these shores. Mr Trump's visit comes at a tricky time politically for Britain. He will be visiting the lamest of lame duck prime ministers in the form of Theresa May who is standing down as Conservative leader at the end of the week. Britain is still gripped by the dread hand of the Brexit debate. In his Sun interview, the president criticised Mrs May for allowing the EU ""to have all the cards"" in the negotiations. And, in an interview published a day later, he told the Sunday Times the governmentshould bring in Nigel Farage- an arch critic of Mrs May - to help the Brexit negotiations. This week's visit is scheduled to include a joint news conference with Theresa May, something the pair did when he came to the UK last July Mr Trump had already expressed his support for Nigel Farage, saying the leader of the newly-formed Brexit Party was his friend, a ""big power"" in the UK and someone for whom he had a lot of respect. Will Mr Trump find time to meet Mr Farage? Downing Street has rejected the idea of there being an official meeting between the two, but might there be time for a quick cup of tea at Winfield House, the London residence of the US ambassador? Neither side are ruling it out. One minister told me this would be seen as both disappointing and rude. But Mr Trump rarely misses a chance to associate with like-minded politicians, if nothing else to emphasise what he sees as the growing success of his kind of politics. He will not mind that the two main opposition party leaders - Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Vince Cable - have refused their invitations to dine with him at the state banquet. Mr Trump also arrives in the middle of the Conservative leadership contest that will determine the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. He has already backed one candidate, the front-runner, Boris Johnson. The president told The Sun the former foreign secretary would be an excellent prime minister who would do ""a very good job"". On one hand, there will be some Conservative MPs and party members who will be impressed by this, welcoming the idea that a potential future prime minister already has a good relationship with a close ally. On the other, there may be some MPs who believe the unofficial endorsement from an unpopular US president might not endear Mr Johnson to the wider British electorate, which has more mixed feelings about Mr Trump. This video can not be played Trump: I like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage Remember that Mr Trump has already backed Mr Johnson, saying when he was in the UK last year that Mr Johnson - a former US citizen - would make ""a great prime minister"". Equally interesting would be any remarks Mr Trump chooses to make about the Labour leader, Mr Corbyn, who could one day be the person he meets for lunch in Downing Street, a leader who has made no secret of his hostility towards many US policies. Mr Trump told The Sun he was ""not offended"" by Mr Corbyn's refusal to attend the state banquet, saying: ""He is probably making a mistake because I think he would want to get along with the United States."" In a visit focused on ceremony and talks with an outgoing prime minister, the opportunity to discuss substantive policy will be, by necessity, constrained. But there will be much to disagree about in a trip that is supposed to emphasise unity. Take, for example, the Middle East. The British and US disagree about how best to change Iran's behaviour - the UK still supports the agreement designed to curb Tehran's nuclear programme, the US does not and is ready to sanction any British firm or bank that trades with Iran. The US has deployed a carrier strike force and B52 bombers to the region, something some British diplomats fear could provoke escalation, even war. Are these differences something Mr Trump will wish to raise in public? Is the United States heading for war with Iran? Trump: War would mean 'end of Iran' The president will also bring with him his adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is expected soon to announce the US so-called ""deal of the century"" to try to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The British government is concerned about any attempt to impose a unilateral plan that disposes of the two-state solution and seeks to buy off the Palestinians with hard cash. The Americans have already made it clear they are willing to press ahead without European support, just so long as they have the backing of one or two Arab states. Will any tough talking in Downing Street spill over into the news conference that follows? Let us not forget China. The growing confrontation between the US and China is worrying British policymakers, not just because of the potential impact on global economic growth. But there is also the not so minor matter of Huawei. The US is already angry at the decision - yet to be finalised - by British ministersto consider allowing the Chinese telecoms giant to build part of the UK's 5G mobile network. They fear this would potentially give the Chinese state access - via Huawei - to British and thus American secrets. Huawei: The world's most controversial company? Beijing defends Huawei amid 5G row US officials are warning that Mr Trump will not only raise this during the state visit but may even threaten to limit sharing intelligence with the UK as a result. Just consider what that might mean: the so-called ""special relationship"" has always had as a central core the sharing of intelligence - a relationship between security professionals that is supposed to be eternal, outside the squalls of political disagreement. So it would be hard for the president to praise UK-US relations while at the same time threatening to withhold intelligence. US officials say they are reassured that the UK decision on Huawei is not final and on hold until a new prime minister is elected. But they cannot rule out strong words on the subject from their president. Mr Trump, of course, once suggested that UK intelligence agencies were involved in a plot against his election - something they dismissed publicly as ridiculous nonsense.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonny Dymond on what to expect from President Trump's visit to the UK US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are making a state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Here's a rundown of what we can expect. It's a formal trip to the UK by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. Although they're grand occasions, they're not just ceremonial affairs - they're also used by the government to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state per year and has hosted 112 of these visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Familyhas a full list of all the other state visits,external, and details ofhow the ceremonies unfold,external. Visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, but because Buckingham Palace is being renovated the US president is not expected to stay there. While Mr Trump is only the third US president to make a state visit to the UK, the Queenhas met almost all the US presidents in office during that time, either in the UK or in the US. On Monday, the first day of Mr Trump's three-day trip, a ceremonial welcome attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall was held in the Buckingham Palace garden. After the welcome, the Duke of Sussex joined the group for a private lunch at the palace. This video can not be played Here's what happened on day one of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK (tweets not included). Mr and Mrs Trump then visited Westminster Abbey for a tour and met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea at Clarence House. Astate banquet in the palace's ballroom took place on Monday evening, with Mr Trump, the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with other UK public figures and prominent Americans living in Britain. The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May will host a business breakfast attended by the Duke of York at St James's Palace. Business leaders understood to be attending include Barclays CEO Jes Staley, GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Emma Walmsley, BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and the National Grid's John Pettigrew. Mr Trump will then visit Downing Street for talks with Theresa May. They are expected to discuss a range of issues on which they hold differing views - includingclimate changeandHuawei. Trump visit: A barometer of political power The talks will be followed by a joint press conference. Mrs May is due to step down as prime minister on 7 June. Thousands of people are expected to join protests against Mr Trump's visit in UK cities on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the London rally in Trafalgar Square, where he will be joined by members of other political parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. In the evening, the Trumps will host a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador attended by Charles and Camilla on behalf of the Queen. The trip is expected to culminate on Wednesday 5 June with Mr Trump, the Queen and Prince Charles attending the national commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. More than 300 veterans will be at the ceremony, which will feature musical performances, testimonial readings and military displays. Trump visit 'will detract from D-Day event' Following the D-Day event Mr Trump will travel to his hotel and golf resort in Doonbeg, in the Republic of Ireland. He will hold a meeting with Irish premier Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport. A visiting leader will sometimes speak at the Houses of Parliament during a state visit, but Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Tuesday he had not received a request for Mr Trump to do so. The president has suggested he ""may"" meet Conservative MP and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage during his visit -both of whom he described as ""friends"" and ""good guys"". The prime minister says the visit is a chance for the UK and the US to strengthen their ""already close relationship"". Talks will cover areas such as trade, investment, security and defence. But Mr Trump is a controversial figure and many have opposed the visit. Thousands gathered to protest against President Trump's policies when he visited the UK in 2018 His policies - from the executive order that restricts entry to the US from certain countries, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - have provoked criticism, both domestically and internationally. And that is to say nothing about some of the comments he's made - including outspoken attacks against political opponents, the media, and his critics - and the investigation into his links to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also declined an invitation. Others argue that the US is a key ally of the UK and that Mr Trump should be welcomed accordingly. When the president's on the move - you know about it The security operation surrounding Mr Trump's visit could cost more than Â£18m. It is intended to createan impenetrable ring of steelaround the US president. The president arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, with space for conference and dining rooms and a medical facility with an operating table. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines nicknamed The Beast and other security and communications vehicles, was flown across ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. In 2018, almost 10,000 officers from the UK were deployed for Mr Trump's trip, with nearly every force in the country providing staff to support the operation. This video can not be played Dinner, talks and golf: A look back at President Trump's last visit to the UK It was certainly eventful. As well as holding talks with Mrs May at her country residence, Chequers, and having tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle, the trip was marked by demonstrations. Tens of thousands of peoplegathered in central London to protest against him. There was also a six-metre ""Trump baby"" blimp - depicting the president as a nappy-wearing infant - inflated outside Parliament. And at his golf resort at Turnberry, Ayrshire,one protester paraglided over the hotelas Mr Trump played the course. Campaigners have claimed they will mobilise ""huge numbers"" in response to Mr Trump's arrival. On Monday supporters of the human rights charity Amnesty unfurled five banners facing the US embassy on Vauxhall Bridge, reading ""Resist sexism"", ""Resist racism"", ""Resist hate"", ""Resist cruelty"" and ""Resist Trump"". A ""national demonstration"" in London's Trafalgar Square will start at 11:00 BST on Tuesday, while protests are also planned in Birmingham, Stoke, Sheffield, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Chester, Leicester, Oxford and Exeter. A 16ft talking robot of Mr Trump sitting on a golden toilet is also expected to make an appearance. Trump visit: A barometer of power Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?
