"Charles Green was arrested five years ago over the ""alleged fraudulent acquisition"" of Rangers but the prosecution was dropped Two ex-Rangers directors have received an apology from the head of Scotland's prosecution service after they were wrongly prosecuted on fraud charges. Both former chief executive Charles Green and director Imran Ahmad were arrested in connection with a fraud probe relating to the sale of Rangers. But Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC has admitted the pair ""should never have been prosecuted"". Mr Green and Mr Ahmad are pressing for taxpayer-funded damages. The Lord Advocate has alreadyapologised to two financial expertsalso wrongfully prosecuted in connection with the sale of Rangers and issued them with Â£10.5m in damages each. Inquiry into wrongful prosecution of Rangers administrators Lord Advocate says sorry to former Rangers administrators Green to get compensation over 'malicious' fraud probe Mr Wolffe, who last month announcedhe was going to leave his post, said: ""Between 2015 and 2016, Mr Ahmad and Mr Green were prosecuted in the High Court concerning matters associated with Rangers Football Club. ""They should not have been prosecuted and, as Lord Advocate and head of the system for the prosecution of crime in Scotland, I have apologised unreservedly that they were. ""I made a statement to the Scottish Parliament following the settlement of two related cases, and I said at that time that there had been profound departures from normal practice."" Charges against Imran Ahmad were dropped in 2018 and he is currently pursuing the Crown Office for damages Mr Wolffe added that he felt ""lessons have been learned"" to ""prevent a similar situation arising in the future"". Ajudge-led inquiry is to be held into the Rangers prosecution sagabut Mr Wolffe has said the inquiry has to wait until all related legal proceedings have concluded. The compensation claims by Mr Ahmad and Mr Green have still to be settled. Mr Green was unveiled as the new man behind Rangers in 2012 but stepped down the following year. In 2015, the 67-year-old and five others, including Mr Ahmad, were charged with serious organised crime offences in relation to the acquisition of the club.

"Colin Pitchfork raped and murdered two Leicestershire schoolgirls A double child killer who was the first murderer to be convicted using DNA evidence can be released, the Parole Board has confirmed. Colin Pitchfork, 61, was jailed for life for raping and murdering 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire in the 1980s. Pitchfork has spent 33 years in prison - he was last denied parole in 2018. The Parole Board said it was satisfied Pitchfork was suitable for release, which is subject to conditions. ""Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority,"" a Parole Board spokesman said. The decision is provisional for 21 days, the spokesman added. Pitchfork raped 15-year-old Lynda Mann and strangled her with her scarf In a document explaining its decision, the Parole Board said at the time of the offences, Pitchfork had been someone who thought ""about sex a lot"" and used ""violence and excessive force"" and ""sex to demonstrate power and control over women"". He also struggled to cope with anger, loneliness and had a willingness to ""seek revenge"". But in prison, the Parole Board said he had taken part in several courses to address his behaviour and the panel heard Pitchfork's ""behaviour in custody had been positive and had included extensive efforts to help others"", including learning skills to help disabled people. The panel concluded: ""After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in custody and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel was satisfied that Mr Pitchfork was suitable for release."" A source close to Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the government would take legal advice to explore the use of the ""reconsideration mechanism"". TheParole Board Reconsideration Mechanism,external, introduced in 2019, gives people the right to ask for a decision to be looked at again if they believe it was ""procedurally unfair"" or ""irrational"". South Leicestershire MP Alberto Costa, who had met with the Parole Board over Pitchfork's case, told the BBC he was ""appalled"" at the news. ""Even though some 30 years have passed, this isn't the sort of crime one can ever forget,"" he said. ""My constituents remember the victims, people who went to school with these victims. ""It would be immoral, wrong and frankly dangerous to release this disgraceful murderer of two children."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands He added he would be lobbying Mr Buckland to block the release. ""I will work my socks off to make sure [the decision] is reconsidered and he is kept behind bars,"" he said. Speaking to the BBC when Pitchfork was last denied parole, Lynda's mother Kath Eastwood said: ""The Parole Board have made the right decision [and] put the families of the victims first and listened to us before the murderer. ""Let us hope this continues."" When Colin Pitchfork was given a life sentence, it came with a minimum term that he had to serve behind bars as punishment, before he could ask experts to review whether he would be safe for release on what's known as a ""licence"". That's a set of controls on his movements and activities that he must abide by for the rest of his days. If he breaks any of the 35 conditions, he can be immediately taken back to jail - and so his life sentence hangs over him forever. Only a tiny fraction of offenders are subject to a ""whole life"" order, because the system acknowledges many offenders may become less dangerous as they respond to rehabilitation programmes over the years. The judges and other experts who make up the Parole Board can only authorise a lifer's release on licence if the evidence shows that it is no longer necessary to hold the offender in prison for public protection. The families can petition the Justice Secretary Robert Buckland to ask the Parole Board to think again - but a review would have to show that it would be irrational to release Pitchfork on the available evidence. Mr Buckland cannot overturn the decision because of political or media pressure. But Parliament can change the law. MPs will get the chance to do so when they vote on a government proposal that future premeditated child killers are considered for whole life terms when they are convicted and sentenced. Colin Pitchfork, 22 at the time of the first murder, was married with two sons. He was a baker who grew up in rural Leicestershire and lived in Littlethorpe In November 1983 he left his baby son sleeping in the back of his car and raped and strangled 15-year-old Lynda Mann in Narborough. He then drove home and put his son to bed Three years later, less than a mile from where Lynda died, he raped and murdered Dawn Ashworth, also 15, of Enderby. The pathologist who examined her body described it as a ""brutal sexual assault"" A police investigation initially led to the wrong man, a local 17-year-old who falsely confessed to one of the killings. After an unprecedented mass screening of 5,000 men using pioneering ""DNA profiling"" technology, Pitchfork waseventually caught. At first, Pitchfork had evaded justice by persuading a colleague to take the test for him He pleaded guilty to both murders in September 1987 and was sentenced to life in January 1988. The judge said the killings were ""particularly sadistic"" and he doubted Pitchfork would ever be released In 2009, his 30-yearlife tariff was reduced by two years,externalfor ""exceptional progress"" - a decision that was strongly criticised by the families of his victims He wasmoved to an undisclosed open prisonat some point prior to 8 January 2017, after his request for release Pitchfork's parole hearing was held via video link on 22 March and included evidence from his probation office and a prison service psychologist. The board then considered the evidence along with an examination of the ""robustness"" of the risk management plan before concluding its review on 25 May. The decision to direct Pitchfork's release was published on Monday. His release is subject to a number of licence conditions. These include living at a designated address, taking part in probation supervision, wearing an electronic tag, taking part in lie detector tests and having to disclose what vehicles he uses and who he speaks to, with particular limits on contact with children. He will also be subject to a curfew, have restrictions on using technology and limits on where he can go. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said: ""We understand this will be an extremely upsetting decision for the families of Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth and our heartfelt sympathies remain with them. ""If Colin Pitchfork is released, he will be closely supervised by the probation service for the rest of his life and can be brought back to prison if he breaks the strict conditions he will be subject to.""

"A fan zone on Glasgow Green will accommodate up to 6,000 fans a day for the Euro 2020 matches The decision to create a Euro 2020 fan zone in Glasgow amid rising Covid cases has been described as an ""absolute slap"" to the hospitality sector. The city only moved to level two on Saturday after enduringsome of the strictest restrictionsin the country for almost nine months. But a trade body fears mass gatherings of up to 6,000 fans a day could lead to a return to level three. The Scottish government said the fan zone plan was still being reviewed. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to address the issue during a virus update to parliament on Tuesday. But BBC Scotland understands it could be later in the week before a final decision is announced. It wasrevealed last monththat the Glasgow Green event would be open for the 31 days of the tournament from 11 June. Organisers said there would be a ""festival atmosphere"" with food, drinks and activities as well as screenings of all games. But since then case numbers have risen in Scotland and on Friday the country recorded itshighest number of daily positive testssince February. Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, said his members were worried about the potential fall out. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We were told at the beginning of May by Glasgow City Council that there would be no alcohol at the fan zone and now we are having it. ""I think it is an absolute slap to the hospitality sector within Glasgow who have just opened in a level two situation."" Mr Montgomery said he accepted there was less risk of the virus spreading outdoors but he highlighted reports that the Delta variant, first detected in India, is40% more transmissible. He added: ""Hospitality in Glasgow cannot be forced back into a level threes situation after this, because Glasgow didn't ask for this."" Are you planning to watch the Euros? Will you be staying at home or do you have tickets for the fan zone? Please share your stories and pictures with us.

Mr Montgomery admitted there was a fear the event would take business away from pubs and restaurants but he claimed the issue was not just about the hospitality sector as the restrictions have also affected retail. He said his members were not allowed to advertise that they are showing the tournament, which kicks off in Rome on Friday, and he criticised the proposed testing protocols. The fan zone will be ticketed and subject to physical distancing rules. But while attendees are being encouraged to test themselves before going to the fan zone, a negative result will not be required before entry is granted. There are nofan zone tickets,externalleft for Scotland's group games against the Czech Republic (14 June), England (18 June) and Croatia (22 June) and some supporters have even booked hotels in the city so they can attend. Should Scotland progress to the knock-out phase of a major tournament for the first time, both potential last 16 match dates - 28 and 29 June - have also sold out, as have all tickets for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final on 11 July. Mr Montgomery said: ""We've seen in Liverpool in the trial events that everybody was tested before they went in and everybody was tested after they finished."" ""We're not seeing that in Glasgow Green, people are coming in without testing."" On Monday, the Scottish government said that everyone attending the fan zone was being encouraged to take up the offer of twice-weekly rapid lateral flow testing and get a PCR test in the event of a positive result. A spokeswoman said: ""Decisions about testing and other arrangements at the fan zone are taken jointly by the Scottish government, Glasgow Life, Public Health Scotland and other partners and discussions are ongoing. ""Attendance at the fan zone may provide an opportunity for people and families to gather safely in a controlled environment - with necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures in place - to enjoy the tournament. The fan zone is ticketed and people's contact details will be recorded to allow for any track and trace. ""However, as we have always said, if there are concerns about the safe delivery of fan zone due to prevalence of the virus then it may be necessary to review and modify these plans."" Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld told BBC Scotland'sSunday Showshe was ""worried"" about the idea. Prof Bauld said although the fan zone is outdoors it carries a risk of transmission as people will be cheering and hugging while watching the football. She added: ""My personal view, and this is a personal view, I would have appreciated if it might have been run a bit like theEvents Research Programme,external, the festival in Liverpool where people had to demonstrate a negative test before they went in. But it doesn't sound like that has been set up. ""The decision will be taken this week but it is not without its risks and that is absolutely the case."" Last week another expert called on the Scottish government to""rethink"" its decisionto allow supporters into the fan zone without testing them for Covid. The University of Edinburgh's Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said allowing fans to gather was a ""risk"", and urged them to test themselves before attending. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"A group of Conservative rebel MPs has been thwarted in its bid to overturn Â£4bn of government cuts to the overseas aid budget. They had suggested returning spending from 0.5% to 0.7% of national income next year through a bill dealing with the UK's new research agency. But the proposal was ruled inadmissible by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, meaning it will not be put to a vote. However, he called on ministers to give MPs an ""effective"" vote on the issue. Sir Lindsay said the rebels' amendment was not within the remit of the law they wanted to change - meaning it could not be allowed. Despite this, he said ministers should give the Commons ""the respect it deserves"" and find a way to allow MPs an ""effective decision"" on the target. He has granted the rebels a three-hour emergency debate on Tuesday to put their point across - although there will not be a binding vote on their desired changes. Theresa May joins bid to reverse foreign aid cuts Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Foreign aid: What is it used for? A leading rebel, Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, claimed the group would have had enough support to defeat the government if the vote had taken place. He said maintaining the cuts would lead to ""hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths"" in affected countries. He had previously pledged to ""use all the parliamentary procedures we can"" to force a vote on the issue if their amendment was not selected on Monday. The government reduced aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income this year, without changing the 2015 law that made the target binding. Ministers have argued this legislation allows the target to be temporarily missed in exceptional circumstances - and says the Covid pandemic counts. But the decision not to give MPs a vote on the issue has angered a number of backbenchers, and led to the threat of legal action. Ministers will be relieved to avoid a vote on the aid cuts, ahead of welcoming world leaders from the G7 group for asummit in Cornwallthis weekend. The failure by MPs to secure a vote on the government's aid cuts does not mark the end of the story. While the rebels may have been stymied by a parliamentary technicality, the Speaker made it very clear he wanted the Commons to having a meaningful vote on the issue soon. And if it did not, then he would ""look at other ways we can move forward"". In the formal language of a parliamentary speaker, this is a threat that if the government does not arrange a vote itself, he may allow the next amendment the rebels table. Their problem, however, is that a legislative opportunity may not now come until the autumn. It means a summer of continuing uncertainty for aid charities, and those they help. As for the government, it has achieved its immediate aim of avoiding what could well have been its first parliamentary defeat. But it still faces another day of criticism for its international aid cuts in the same week it hosts the G7 summit. The government says aid spending will return to the higher 0.7% level ""when the fiscal situation allows"" - but has not specified a date. On Sunday,a group of charities and academics warned""devastation"" caused by the cuts would lead to families going hungry and girls missing school. The group, including Oxfam and ActionAid UK, also argued it would undermine the UK's international standing and its hosting of the G7. Lee Margaret Webster from ActionAid told the BBC the cuts had forced a project tackling violence against women and girls in Rwanda to close. This included shutting down seven shelters providing sanctuary for girls escaping domestic violence, she said. Earlier, Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said the UK was a big aid donor but added: ""We have a duty to ensure we protect our citizens here as well as those in the rest of the world."" And ex-Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued the UK shouldn't ""end up going into deeper debt in order to finance other countries"". Writing in the Telegraph,external, she said the UK should instead help poorer countries ""trade their way out of poverty"". ""If more and more aid was the solution, large parts of Africa would have escaped all poverty decades ago,"" she added. Former prime minister Theresa May was among the rebels who hoped to defeat the government The rebels had wanted to amend legislation setting up the Advanced Research and Invention Agency - anew bodydesigned to conduct ""high risk"" research. Their amendment would have forced the organisation to make up any shortfall from the 0.7% target from January 2022. Sir Lindsay said he shared the ""frustration"" of MPs about the lack of a vote to date - but after consulting officials, he decided their amendment was outside the scope of the bill, meaning under Commons rules it could not be debated. He added: ""I expect that the government should find a way to have this important matter debated and to allow the House formally to take an effective decision"". Labour - which along with the Lib Dems and SNP supported the amendment - called on ministers to come up with a ""clear timeline"" for reversing the cuts. The party's shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said the ""strength and depth"" of support among MPs for the move was ""clear"". Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts?

"Sharing health data of family members is one new feature coming to Apple health Apple device users will now be able see when individual apps request to access features such as the microphone, camera and phone gallery, plus which third parties they have connected with in the last seven days. The new ""app privacy report"" feature was unveiled at the firm's annual developers' conference, WWDC. Apple has prioritised privacy lately, including a war on ad-tracking. No new hardware was announced at the event, despite earlier speculation. The new privacy report goes further than Apple's existing ""nutrition labels"" which show users what kinds of permissions apps ask for, before they are installed. It will allow users to dive deep into when exactly an app used the permissions it has been given - and what third-party websites it contacted or sent data to. ""Apple continues to double down on privacy,"" said Thomas Husson, analyst at Forrester. ""In this area, no doubt Apple is leading the pack and setting the tone for the rest of the industry."" App privacy reports will show exactly what third-party domains are contacted by an app Other privacy-focused updates included: audio processing moving to be on-device only - so voice commands to Apple's smart assistant Siri will not be uploaded to central servers, unlike competitors such as the Amazon Echo Apple Mail to hide the IP address of the device it is accessed on, meaning that senders of marketing emails, for example, cannot track where an email is sent and whether it is read Apple's own web browser Safari will prevent any third parties from accessing a user's IP address to block tracking iCloud subscribers will have the option to route Safari traffic through two internet relays, similar to a VPN, to hide your identity; and the ""hide my email"" feature, first unveiled in 2019, will be extended to hide email addresses when used to sign up to a number of online services However a previous move by the tech giantto offer its customers a choice over whether to accept tracking for the purposes of advertisingwas criticised by a number of firms, including Facebook and other free-to-use services, for which ad tracking is a rich source of revenue. The firm also showed off a raft of updates to its Facetime video calling platform, some of which appear to compete with apps such as Zoom which exploded in popularity during the pandemic. They include a gallery mode to view multiple speakers, a portrait mode with blurred backgrounds, and the ability to schedule Facetime calls and create web links. The so-called SharePlay feature lets users watch movies or listen to music together over a Facetime call This will also enable Android and Windows PC users to join calls, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. Until now, the platform has only worked between Apple devices. The new features form part of its latest operating system, iOS15. ""Allowing Apple owners to invite Android and PC users to FaceTime calls via a browser acknowledges the pandemic has sparked explosive growth in group video calling,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""Apple risked being left behind services such as Teams and Zoom - but browser-based calling won't be enough to close the gap."" Digital keys are coming to Apple Wallet, announced the firm's Jennifer Bailey. Car firm BMW and hotel chain Hyatt will be among the first to offer the keys - and it will also be available for homes. The collaboration with BMW was initially announced at WWDC 2020 but has yet to actually launch. Some US states will now accept forms of ID through the Wallet app, Apple said In some US states, iPhone users will also be able to store their State ID and driving licences, with the Transportation Security Administration lined up to be among the first to be able to use it, said Ms Bailey. Apple also announced Live Text, which is able to scan a user's library of photos for text that can be made searchable and copied and pasted between apps - for example, a phone number from a business card or menu. Some note-taking apps have used optical character recognition (OCR) for similar reasons for years, but Apple's solution is baked into the phone operating system itself. The health app can now track walking steadiness and issue alerts if a user appears less steady, along with exercise suggestions as to how it might improve. Apple also enabled health app data sharing with doctors, and between family members, but only with the health app user's consent. The encrypted data is not visible to the tech giant, it stressed. Apple boss Tim Cook introduced the WWDC conference However, there may be a cultural barrier to overcome here, said Ben Wood. ""The ability to share health data with other family members looks an interesting idea on paper, but it is hard to see that many parents would want to share updates with their children,"" he said. There may, for example, be a number of reasons why a person's heart rate increases which are not medical emergencies. Others, like Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies, said she could see it being taken up by families who live far away. ""My biggest worry over the pandemic was my mom and asking how she was felt like nagging her,""she tweeted,external.

"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed comments made by the Culture Secretary that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) went ""over the top"" in suspending bowler Ollie Robinson for historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts, from 2012 and 2013 when Robinson was a teenager, were revealed while he was making his England debut during thedrawn first Testagainst New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped for the second Test, which begins at Edgbaston on Thursday, pending an investigation. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asked the ECB to ""think again"". Dowden said the tweets were ""offensive and wrong"" but ""also a decade old and written by a teenager"". A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said: ""The PM is supportive of Oliver Dowden's comments. As Dowden set out, these were comments made more than a decade ago written by someone as a teenager and for which they've rightly apologised."" The ECB will not be making any comment about Dowden's stance. England bowler Robinson suspended for historical tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play,he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" The ECB must determine whether Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent of the ECB, will carry out the investigation. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain David Gower agreed with Dowden, saying he did not think a suspension was the right way forward. ""The ECB should say 'let's learn from this' and make him do the equivalent of community service,"" said Gower. ""He should go out there among county cricketers and spread the word that social media shouldn't be abused."" However, Michael Carberry, who played six Tests for England between 2010 and 2014, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Robinson ""wouldn't be playing Test cricket"" if it was up to him. ""I don't believe this is a problem where you can rehabilitate someone,"" said Carberry. ""Robinson spoke about educating himself, but what is he talking about? I would be very interested to know."" At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport. ""We've started doing a lot of good work as a team and we'll continue to do that. We want to make the game as inclusive and diverse as we possibly can and we'll continue to keep looking at finding ways to make that possible."" The Prime Minister's spokesperson added he ""respects people's right"" to take the knee, after theEngland football team were booedfor the gesture during their recent friendly matches against Austria and Romania.

"Sharing health data of family members is one new feature coming to Apple health Apple device users will now be able see when individual apps request to access features such as the microphone, camera and phone gallery, plus which third parties they have connected with in the last seven days. The new ""app privacy report"" feature was unveiled at the firm's annual developers' conference, WWDC. Apple has prioritised privacy lately, including a war on ad-tracking. No new hardware was announced at the event, despite earlier speculation. The new privacy report goes further than Apple's existing ""nutrition labels"" which show users what kinds of permissions apps ask for, before they are installed. It will allow users to dive deep into when exactly an app used the permissions it has been given - and what third-party websites it contacted or sent data to. ""Apple continues to double down on privacy,"" said Thomas Husson, analyst at Forrester. ""In this area, no doubt Apple is leading the pack and setting the tone for the rest of the industry."" App privacy reports will show exactly what third-party domains are contacted by an app Other privacy-focused updates included: audio processing moving to be on-device only - so voice commands to Apple's smart assistant Siri will not be uploaded to central servers, unlike competitors such as the Amazon Echo Apple Mail to hide the IP address of the device it is accessed on, meaning that senders of marketing emails, for example, cannot track where an email is sent and whether it is read Apple's own web browser Safari will prevent any third parties from accessing a user's IP address to block tracking iCloud subscribers will have the option to route Safari traffic through two internet relays, similar to a VPN, to hide your identity; and the ""hide my email"" feature, first unveiled in 2019, will be extended to hide email addresses when used to sign up to a number of online services However a previous move by the tech giantto offer its customers a choice over whether to accept tracking for the purposes of advertisingwas criticised by a number of firms, including Facebook and other free-to-use services, for which ad tracking is a rich source of revenue. The firm also showed off a raft of updates to its Facetime video calling platform, some of which appear to compete with apps such as Zoom which exploded in popularity during the pandemic. They include a gallery mode to view multiple speakers, a portrait mode with blurred backgrounds, and the ability to schedule Facetime calls and create web links. The so-called SharePlay feature lets users watch movies or listen to music together over a Facetime call This will also enable Android and Windows PC users to join calls, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. Until now, the platform has only worked between Apple devices. The new features form part of its latest operating system, iOS15. ""Allowing Apple owners to invite Android and PC users to FaceTime calls via a browser acknowledges the pandemic has sparked explosive growth in group video calling,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""Apple risked being left behind services such as Teams and Zoom - but browser-based calling won't be enough to close the gap."" Digital keys are coming to Apple Wallet, announced the firm's Jennifer Bailey. Car firm BMW and hotel chain Hyatt will be among the first to offer the keys - and it will also be available for homes. The collaboration with BMW was initially announced at WWDC 2020 but has yet to actually launch. Some US states will now accept forms of ID through the Wallet app, Apple said In some US states, iPhone users will also be able to store their State ID and driving licences, with the Transportation Security Administration lined up to be among the first to be able to use it, said Ms Bailey. Apple also announced Live Text, which is able to scan a user's library of photos for text that can be made searchable and copied and pasted between apps - for example, a phone number from a business card or menu. Some note-taking apps have used optical character recognition (OCR) for similar reasons for years, but Apple's solution is baked into the phone operating system itself. The health app can now track walking steadiness and issue alerts if a user appears less steady, along with exercise suggestions as to how it might improve. Apple also enabled health app data sharing with doctors, and between family members, but only with the health app user's consent. The encrypted data is not visible to the tech giant, it stressed. Apple boss Tim Cook introduced the WWDC conference However, there may be a cultural barrier to overcome here, said Ben Wood. ""The ability to share health data with other family members looks an interesting idea on paper, but it is hard to see that many parents would want to share updates with their children,"" he said. There may, for example, be a number of reasons why a person's heart rate increases which are not medical emergencies. Others, like Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies, said she could see it being taken up by families who live far away. ""My biggest worry over the pandemic was my mom and asking how she was felt like nagging her,""she tweeted,external.

"Charles Green was arrested five years ago over the ""alleged fraudulent acquisition"" of Rangers but the prosecution was dropped Two ex-Rangers directors have received an apology from the head of Scotland's prosecution service after they were wrongly prosecuted on fraud charges. Both former chief executive Charles Green and director Imran Ahmad were arrested in connection with a fraud probe relating to the sale of Rangers. But Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC has admitted the pair ""should never have been prosecuted"". Mr Green and Mr Ahmad are pressing for taxpayer-funded damages. The Lord Advocate has alreadyapologised to two financial expertsalso wrongfully prosecuted in connection with the sale of Rangers and issued them with Â£10.5m in damages each. Inquiry into wrongful prosecution of Rangers administrators Lord Advocate says sorry to former Rangers administrators Green to get compensation over 'malicious' fraud probe Mr Wolffe, who last month announcedhe was going to leave his post, said: ""Between 2015 and 2016, Mr Ahmad and Mr Green were prosecuted in the High Court concerning matters associated with Rangers Football Club. ""They should not have been prosecuted and, as Lord Advocate and head of the system for the prosecution of crime in Scotland, I have apologised unreservedly that they were. ""I made a statement to the Scottish Parliament following the settlement of two related cases, and I said at that time that there had been profound departures from normal practice."" Charges against Imran Ahmad were dropped in 2018 and he is currently pursuing the Crown Office for damages Mr Wolffe added that he felt ""lessons have been learned"" to ""prevent a similar situation arising in the future"". Ajudge-led inquiry is to be held into the Rangers prosecution sagabut Mr Wolffe has said the inquiry has to wait until all related legal proceedings have concluded. The compensation claims by Mr Ahmad and Mr Green have still to be settled. Mr Green was unveiled as the new man behind Rangers in 2012 but stepped down the following year. In 2015, the 67-year-old and five others, including Mr Ahmad, were charged with serious organised crime offences in relation to the acquisition of the club.

"This video can not be played UK tourists say the rush to return from Portugal ""put everybody on a downer"" British holidaymakers in Portugal are rushing back home before the country is added to the UK's travel amber list amid concerns about rising Covid cases. From 04:00 BST on Tuesday Portugal will be dropped from the green list, and returnees made to self-isolate for 10 days and take two PCR tests. Airlines have added extra capacity, with British Airways and EasyJet saying there are seats available. But people are reporting difficulties in getting pre-departure tests. Bookings to Portugal soared last month after it was placed on the green list, meaning UK residents could travel there without having to quarantine on their return. The government last Thursday announced Portugal would move to the amber list. The Department for Transport cited a near doubling of positive Covid cases in Portugal in the last three weeks, and concerns about the detection of a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""tough"" rules on travel were necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? Thirty-nine flights will leave Faro Airport in the Algarve for the UK on Monday, nearly twice the usual total, but ticket prices are significantly higher than later in the week. BA said passengers can change to a different flight free of charge by rebooking through its website, while EasyJet says it will not charge fees for switching flights. However, the UK move has seen some passengers struggle to obtain proof of the negative Covid test needed before they can return to the UK. Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley, from Derby, arrived for an eight-day break in the Algarve just before the change to the amber list was announced, and say it was ""almost impossible"" for them to return. ""To say we are incensed is an understatement,"" said Mr Stanley. ""We have been unable to get any return flights... We now have to do a further two tests at an additional cost to the three tests we have paid for if we want to come out of isolation after five days."" Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley were unable to obtain Covid tests Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Mantana added: ""We've got to finish the holiday and then go into quarantine when we get back. ""The implications are we are volunteers at a vaccine centre... we've had to let those people down. Equally I shield an aunty who has severe medical conditions... and I'm not going to be able to do that."" This is exactly what the travel industry had hoped to avoid this summer. They thought the roll-out of the vaccine would bring more consistency, as would the government's introduction of a watch list, intended to signal to potential passengers that a country could be on the verge of tipping from green to amber. But the government has shown that when it is concerned about letting in variants, it can and will close the doors as it did last summer. It has led to huge frustration in the travel sector and made many nervous about how strong sales will be this summer, the crucial season for the industry. Some are already calling for furlough to be extended beyond September into the winter. Most crucially for those running the operations is understanding how and why countries are moved between lists, something they say the government needs to be more transparent about. The government would disagree, saying it always been about the vaccine, variants, the virus and genomic sequencing. The next list is expected in a few weeks' time. Between now and then there will be pressure from industry for the government to open up or offer them sector specific support. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes Meanwhile, a holidaymaker who flew back on Sunday has described ""chaotic"" scenes at Faro airport. Mike Indian says he heard the final calls for his flight back to London Luton while in a long queue. Other passengers let him and many others move to the front. ""The moment the bag goes down the chute it's like the starting pistol and there's dozens of us running through Faro airport and up the escalators,"" he told the BBC. ""We finally reached the gate but we made it with five minutes to spare."" Gary Turner says he endured long waits at Faro Airport Gary and Cassie Turner from Epsom, who ended their holiday in Carvoeiro on the Algarve on Sunday, had a three-hour wait at the Faro check-in desk. ""There were people being told that if they had missed their flight because they had been queuing for so long that they had to book another,"" Mr Turner said. ""When we boarded we were then stuck on the tarmac for another three hours while other passengers were rounded up, and when they couldn't wait any longer they also had to take bags off the plane."" Alis Ahmedova and her fiance, from Beckenham, London, arrived back from Lisbon on Sunday night. ""We received the news that Portugal is no longer a green list country. This was the beginning of the end for us. After some deliberation, we decided to change our flight and cut our holiday short."" But she said they were initially refused boarding and missed their flight home because of difficulties with thepassenger locator form,externalthat all travellers to the UK need to complete. ""We tried everything... but the form was not accepting our seat numbers and Covid test reference numbers."" Alan and Lisa Pechey, from Cambridge, who were also in Lisbon, told the PA news agency they spent Â£800 on return flights to avoid quarantine. Speaking from Gatwick Airport, Mrs Pechey, 66, said: ""The government was totally unfair to throw that at us on Thursday because it really spoiled our holiday, totally... they should have told us to watch out if we were going to Portugal so everyone would have known."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area On 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. Portugal said it could not understand the ""logic"" of the UK move, and argued the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. Its national hotels association says about half of bookings in the Algarve for June were cancelled within hours of the UK announcement. Tim Alderslade from industry body Airlines UK said ""three months in the summer"" now appeared to be the ""best case scenario"" for travel companies, and they could end up seeking further government financial support.

"A US drug company says it has created the first therapy that could slow Alzheimer's disease, and it is now ready to bring it to market. Currently, there are no drugs that can do this - existing ones only help with symptoms. Biogen,externalsays it will soon seek regulatory approval in the US for the ""groundbreaking"" drug, called aducanumab. It plans to file the paperwork in early 2020 and has its sights on Europe too. Approval processes could take a year or two. If successful, the company aims to initially offer the drug to patients previously enrolled in clinical studies of the drug. The announcement is somewhat surprising because the company had discontinued work on the drug in March 2019, after disappointing trial results. But the company says a new analysis of a larger dataset of the same studies shows that higher doses of aducanumab can provide a significant benefit to patients with early Alzheimer's, slowing their clinical decline so they preserve more of their memory and every day living skills - things that the disease usually robs. Aducanumab targets a protein called amyloid that forms abnormal deposits the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Scientists think these plaques are toxic to brain cells and that clearing them using drugs would be a massive advance in dementia treatment, although not a cure. There haven't been any new dementia drugs in over a decade. Dementia: The greatest health challenge of our time New type of dementia identified Biogen's chief executive Michel Vounatsos said: ""We are hopeful about the prospect of offering patients the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer's disease."" Hilary Evans from Alzheimer's Research UK said: ""People affected by Alzheimer's have waited a long time for a life-changing new treatment and this exciting announcement offers new hope that one could be in sight. ""Taking another look at aducanumab is a positive step for all those who took part in the clinical trials and the worldwide dementia research community. As more data emerges, we hope it will spark global discussions about the next steps for delivering much-needed treatments into people's hands."" Prof Bart De Strooper, Director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, said: ""It is fantastic to hear of these new positive results emerging from the aducanumab trials. We currently have no effective treatments to slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease and I hope this signifies a turning point."" Dementia is not a single disease, but is the name for a group of symptoms that include problems with memory and thinking. There are lots of different types of dementia and Alzheimer's is said to be the most common and most researched. There are currently 850,000 people with dementia in the UK. It's been a long and tortuous journey to find new drugs for the disease and recent attempts have ended in failure. Experts hope a treatment is in sight, but they are cautious and will need to closely scrutinise these aducanumab trial findings.

"Airline bosses are urging the US and UK to allow travel to restart ahead of the G7 meeting in Cornwall. The bosses of all airlines that offer UK-US flights and Heathrow Airport issued a joint call for a trans-Atlantic travel ""corridor"" on Monday. The group said it would be ""essential to igniting economic recovery"" in a statement. Nearly all passengers from the UK are currently banned from travelling to the US. Where is on the green list for holiday travel? Travel sector 'frustrated' over rule changes Under a presidential decree introduced last March, non-US citizens who have been in the UK in the last 14 days cannot enter the countryunless a specific exemption applies.,external Meanwhile, travellers from the US to the UK must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival as the country is on the""amber list"".,external But airline bosses argued on Monday that because of the speed of the vaccine roll-out in both countries, travel should be allowed to resume. The Tower of London is the most popular tourist destination for visitors to the UK, according to VisitBritain. Shai Weiss, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said: ""There is no reason for the US to be absent from the UK green list. This overly cautious approach fails to reap the benefits of the successful vaccination programmes in both the UK and the US."" Adding the US to the green list would remove the need for quarantine on return to the UK. Passengers would, however, still need to have proof of a negative Covid test result on departure. ""Customers, families and businesses need to book and travel with confidence. After 15 months of restrictions, the time to act is now,"" Mr Weiss added. John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said: ""Connectivity between the UK and the US is one of the great engines of the global economy."" In a statement, the group estimated that UK businesses are losing Â£23m each day that trans-Atlantic trade links remain closed ""The scientific data shows transatlantic travel and trade can be reopened safely and every day that policymakers delay puts jobs, livelihoods and the economic chances of hardworking folks across our countries at risk unnecessarily,"" said Mr Holland-Kaye. In happier times, London to New York was one of the busiest aviation corridors in the world, with some 30 flights a day between the two cities. And because it was so popular with business travellers, it was also highly profitable. In the year to April 2019, British Airways alone earned more than $1bn (Â£710m) from the route. You can see why the airlines involved are little short of desperate to get transatlantic traffic back up and running. They have been battered by the crisis - and are desperate to generate revenue. Heathrow Airport, too, needs those flights, which bring in income from airport charges, as well as a flow of affluent passengers through its terminals. For a carrier like Virgin Atlantic, wholly focused on long distance services, the stakes are even higher. In normal circumstances, transatlantic routes make up 70% of its network. It may have restructured heavily to see out the immediate crisis, but in the longer term the airline's survival remains at stake. Even if business traffic never gets back to its former levels, the chances are transatlantic routes will remain highly profitable - and for the beleaguered airlines, right now every penny, or every cent, really counts. Doug Parker, the chief executive and chairman of American Airlines, also said reopening travel between the two countries a ""critical next step"" in the travel industry and global economy's recovery. The industry reacted with dismay when no more countries were added to the UK's green list and Portugal was relegated to amber last week, with the rule change taking effect from 04:00 on Tuesday. Critics warned of a loss of jobs and confidence, while Easyjet said the government had torn up its own rules. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said at the time: ""The public has always known travel will be different this year and we must continue to take a cautious approach to reopening international travel in a way that protects public health and the vaccine rollout.""

""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home. This video can not be played UK tourists 'panicked' to get back from Portugal The education secretary goes on to say that, as well as supporting pupils, he wants to support teachers. He says: ""An extra Â£400m will be made available to help provide half a million teacher training opportunities across the country, alongside professional development for those working in early years settings. Williamson says he will ""make sure all of them can access high quality training"" - but does not specify how much the Â£400m works out at per teacher. He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"". Williamson concludes his statement by saying: ""As the prime minister said last week, there is going to be more [funding] coming down the track, but don't forget that this is a huge amount we are spending."" With the health secretary's statement to the Commons now over, we turn to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected. He says the government's total recovery package for education now totals Â£3bn. It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, has hailed tomorrow as ""a watershed moment"". Sir Simon describes the vaccination programme as entering ""the home straight"" after Health Secretary Matt Hancock says first doses of the vaccine would become available to 25-29-year-olds from Tuesday morning. ""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus. Matt Hancock announced that, from tomorrow, people in England aged 25-29 will be able to book a vaccination appointment. You can watch a clip from his statement below. This video can not be played Covid vaccines for 25 to 29-year-olds offered in England Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks why the health secretary is not ""ruling out"" lifting restrictions in England on 21 June. She also urges him to reverse the decision to end mask-wearing in schools. Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses. That means 40,460,576 people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both.

A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week. He asks the health secretary if he can ""give a milestone on when we can unlock international travel - and how can we give this industry and workforce hope for the future?"" Hancock says the government acted on the available bio-security advice, prompted by the presence of the variant Delta AW in Portugal. He agrees opening up international travel is ""challenging"", particularly because of the risk posed by new variants. ""Domestic freedom has to be protected at all costs,"" says Hancock. He stresses the need to protect the UK's borders: ""A variant that undermines the vaccine would put us in a much more difficult place as a country"".  Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson says the Covid data-collection programme - criticised by privacy campaigners - should be paused. Matt Hancock says he agrees that trust is important among NHS patients, but says data compilation is key to beating Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK house prices leapt another 9.5% in the year to May, boosted by the government's stamp duty holiday which ends this month. The Halifax said prices rose by more than Â£22,000 to an average of Â£261,743. But it said buyer preferences are shifting ""in anticipation of new, post-pandemic lifestyles"". ""There's greater demand for larger properties with more space,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. He said this was leading to ""an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of income on housing"". Halifax said annual house price inflation was at its strongest level in nearly seven years, with UK prices rising by 1.3% month-on-month. ""Cheap borrowing and affordability is giving buyers more purchase power, which is pushing up prices,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. Annual house price growth was strongest in Wales, with values soaring by 11.9%, while the north west and Yorkshire and the Humber both posted double-digit growth. But Mr Harris warned that rising property prices are not good news for first-time buyers, and will make getting on the housing ladder even more of a struggle. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic House prices soar 10.9% in 'race for space' ""For Wales and the north west, these are the biggest percentage gains since April 2005, and for Yorkshire and the Humber since June 2006,"" said Mr Galley. ""The south of England, traditionally the driving force of national house price performance, is for once lagging somewhat behind the rest of the country."" In Greater London prices are growing much more slowly than the rest of the country, up just 3.1% over the year. Estate agent Mel John said times were tough for first time buyers But London property prices were already extremely expensive, Mr Galley pointed out: ""Having experienced a boom following the global financial crisis, a phenomenon not felt by many other UK regions and nations to anywhere near the same extent."" ""This market is moving so fast that if you blink, it increases in value,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. ""It is incredible to watch when desire wrests control away from other factors during periods of exceptionally high demand like this and it could be about to get even busier."" She pointed out the market normally has a lull in the summer months ""but now almost all foreign holidays appear to be off, there's nothing stopping the freight train that is unbridled demand from crashing straight through June, July and August"". Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton agreed with that analysis. ""The inability of Britons to go on holiday means there's no distraction now from executing that ambitious move to a larger home.""

"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed comments made by the Culture Secretary that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) went ""over the top"" in suspending bowler Ollie Robinson for historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts, from 2012 and 2013 when Robinson was a teenager, were revealed while he was making his England debut during thedrawn first Testagainst New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped for the second Test, which begins at Edgbaston on Thursday, pending an investigation. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asked the ECB to ""think again"". Dowden said the tweets were ""offensive and wrong"" but ""also a decade old and written by a teenager"". A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said: ""The PM is supportive of Oliver Dowden's comments. As Dowden set out, these were comments made more than a decade ago written by someone as a teenager and for which they've rightly apologised."" The ECB will not be making any comment about Dowden's stance. England bowler Robinson suspended for historical tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play,he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" The ECB must determine whether Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent of the ECB, will carry out the investigation. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain David Gower agreed with Dowden, saying he did not think a suspension was the right way forward. ""The ECB should say 'let's learn from this' and make him do the equivalent of community service,"" said Gower. ""He should go out there among county cricketers and spread the word that social media shouldn't be abused."" However, Michael Carberry, who played six Tests for England between 2010 and 2014, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Robinson ""wouldn't be playing Test cricket"" if it was up to him. ""I don't believe this is a problem where you can rehabilitate someone,"" said Carberry. ""Robinson spoke about educating himself, but what is he talking about? I would be very interested to know."" At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport. ""We've started doing a lot of good work as a team and we'll continue to do that. We want to make the game as inclusive and diverse as we possibly can and we'll continue to keep looking at finding ways to make that possible."" The Prime Minister's spokesperson added he ""respects people's right"" to take the knee, after theEngland football team were booedfor the gesture during their recent friendly matches against Austria and Romania.

"This video can not be played UK tourists say the rush to return from Portugal ""put everybody on a downer"" British holidaymakers in Portugal are rushing back home before the country is added to the UK's travel amber list amid concerns about rising Covid cases. From 04:00 BST on Tuesday Portugal will be dropped from the green list, and returnees made to self-isolate for 10 days and take two PCR tests. Airlines have added extra capacity, with British Airways and EasyJet saying there are seats available. But people are reporting difficulties in getting pre-departure tests. Bookings to Portugal soared last month after it was placed on the green list, meaning UK residents could travel there without having to quarantine on their return. The government last Thursday announced Portugal would move to the amber list. The Department for Transport cited a near doubling of positive Covid cases in Portugal in the last three weeks, and concerns about the detection of a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""tough"" rules on travel were necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? Thirty-nine flights will leave Faro Airport in the Algarve for the UK on Monday, nearly twice the usual total, but ticket prices are significantly higher than later in the week. BA said passengers can change to a different flight free of charge by rebooking through its website, while EasyJet says it will not charge fees for switching flights. However, the UK move has seen some passengers struggle to obtain proof of the negative Covid test needed before they can return to the UK. Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley, from Derby, arrived for an eight-day break in the Algarve just before the change to the amber list was announced, and say it was ""almost impossible"" for them to return. ""To say we are incensed is an understatement,"" said Mr Stanley. ""We have been unable to get any return flights... We now have to do a further two tests at an additional cost to the three tests we have paid for if we want to come out of isolation after five days."" Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley were unable to obtain Covid tests Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Mantana added: ""We've got to finish the holiday and then go into quarantine when we get back. ""The implications are we are volunteers at a vaccine centre... we've had to let those people down. Equally I shield an aunty who has severe medical conditions... and I'm not going to be able to do that."" This is exactly what the travel industry had hoped to avoid this summer. They thought the roll-out of the vaccine would bring more consistency, as would the government's introduction of a watch list, intended to signal to potential passengers that a country could be on the verge of tipping from green to amber. But the government has shown that when it is concerned about letting in variants, it can and will close the doors as it did last summer. It has led to huge frustration in the travel sector and made many nervous about how strong sales will be this summer, the crucial season for the industry. Some are already calling for furlough to be extended beyond September into the winter. Most crucially for those running the operations is understanding how and why countries are moved between lists, something they say the government needs to be more transparent about. The government would disagree, saying it always been about the vaccine, variants, the virus and genomic sequencing. The next list is expected in a few weeks' time. Between now and then there will be pressure from industry for the government to open up or offer them sector specific support. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes Meanwhile, a holidaymaker who flew back on Sunday has described ""chaotic"" scenes at Faro airport. Mike Indian says he heard the final calls for his flight back to London Luton while in a long queue. Other passengers let him and many others move to the front. ""The moment the bag goes down the chute it's like the starting pistol and there's dozens of us running through Faro airport and up the escalators,"" he told the BBC. ""We finally reached the gate but we made it with five minutes to spare."" Gary Turner says he endured long waits at Faro Airport Gary and Cassie Turner from Epsom, who ended their holiday in Carvoeiro on the Algarve on Sunday, had a three-hour wait at the Faro check-in desk. ""There were people being told that if they had missed their flight because they had been queuing for so long that they had to book another,"" Mr Turner said. ""When we boarded we were then stuck on the tarmac for another three hours while other passengers were rounded up, and when they couldn't wait any longer they also had to take bags off the plane."" Alis Ahmedova and her fiance, from Beckenham, London, arrived back from Lisbon on Sunday night. ""We received the news that Portugal is no longer a green list country. This was the beginning of the end for us. After some deliberation, we decided to change our flight and cut our holiday short."" But she said they were initially refused boarding and missed their flight home because of difficulties with thepassenger locator form,externalthat all travellers to the UK need to complete. ""We tried everything... but the form was not accepting our seat numbers and Covid test reference numbers."" Alan and Lisa Pechey, from Cambridge, who were also in Lisbon, told the PA news agency they spent Â£800 on return flights to avoid quarantine. Speaking from Gatwick Airport, Mrs Pechey, 66, said: ""The government was totally unfair to throw that at us on Thursday because it really spoiled our holiday, totally... they should have told us to watch out if we were going to Portugal so everyone would have known."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area On 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. Portugal said it could not understand the ""logic"" of the UK move, and argued the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. Its national hotels association says about half of bookings in the Algarve for June were cancelled within hours of the UK announcement. Tim Alderslade from industry body Airlines UK said ""three months in the summer"" now appeared to be the ""best case scenario"" for travel companies, and they could end up seeking further government financial support.

"UK house prices leapt another 9.5% in the year to May, boosted by the government's stamp duty holiday which ends this month. The Halifax said prices rose by more than Â£22,000 to an average of Â£261,743. But it said buyer preferences are shifting ""in anticipation of new, post-pandemic lifestyles"". ""There's greater demand for larger properties with more space,"" said Halifax managing director Russell Galley. He said this was leading to ""an increased willingness to spend a higher proportion of income on housing"". Halifax said annual house price inflation was at its strongest level in nearly seven years, with UK prices rising by 1.3% month-on-month. ""Cheap borrowing and affordability is giving buyers more purchase power, which is pushing up prices,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. Annual house price growth was strongest in Wales, with values soaring by 11.9%, while the north west and Yorkshire and the Humber both posted double-digit growth. But Mr Harris warned that rising property prices are not good news for first-time buyers, and will make getting on the housing ladder even more of a struggle. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic House prices soar 10.9% in 'race for space' ""For Wales and the north west, these are the biggest percentage gains since April 2005, and for Yorkshire and the Humber since June 2006,"" said Mr Galley. ""The south of England, traditionally the driving force of national house price performance, is for once lagging somewhat behind the rest of the country."" In Greater London prices are growing much more slowly than the rest of the country, up just 3.1% over the year. Estate agent Mel John said times were tough for first time buyers But London property prices were already extremely expensive, Mr Galley pointed out: ""Having experienced a boom following the global financial crisis, a phenomenon not felt by many other UK regions and nations to anywhere near the same extent."" ""This market is moving so fast that if you blink, it increases in value,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. ""It is incredible to watch when desire wrests control away from other factors during periods of exceptionally high demand like this and it could be about to get even busier."" She pointed out the market normally has a lull in the summer months ""but now almost all foreign holidays appear to be off, there's nothing stopping the freight train that is unbridled demand from crashing straight through June, July and August"". Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton agreed with that analysis. ""The inability of Britons to go on holiday means there's no distraction now from executing that ambitious move to a larger home.""

"Children could die as a result of UK cuts to the overseas aid budget, a senior Conservative backbencher says. The prime minister is facing a possible Commons defeat after cutting spending of national income on international development from 0.7% to 0.5%. David Davis - among more than 30 Tories against the move - said some UK-backed schemes have already been cancelled and ""morally, this is a devastating thing"". The government's supporters say the cut is temporary, necessary and popular. Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Foreign aid: What is it used for? Kuenssberg: Numbers look tricky for government in aid vote The Conservative Party committed to spending 0.7% in its manifesto for the 2019 general election - but ministers say it is hard to justify given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic. The cut amounts to almost Â£4bn, but the government said it will still spend more than Â£10bn on foreign aid in 2021. Speaking at the start of a week in which the UK hosts the G7 summit in Cornwall, Mr Davis said: ""Historically, I am a critic of aid spending but doing it this way is really so harmful."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the government were to offer a compromise of a short time frame for their cut to foreign aid spending, ""it helps"". But he said ""if you're a small child and suddenly you get dirty water, you get an infection from it and you die, temporary doesn't mean much"". Mr Davis added: ""If you're going to kill people with this, which I think is going to be the outcome in many areas, we need to reverse those immediately"". Lee Margaret Webster from charity Action Aid told the BBC the cuts had forced a project tackling violence against women and girls in Rwanda to close. This included shutting down seven shelters providing sanctuary for girls escaping domestic violence, she said. The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Former Prime Minister Theresa May isone of the other Tory rebelshoping to achieve a U-turn with an amendment to the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) Bill - a planned new law to set up a new agency designed to come up with innovative policy. It would oblige the agency to make up any shortfall in aid spending if the government were to miss the 0.7% target. The bill is due to be scrutinised in the Commons on Monday afternoon - but it will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether the rebels' amendment should be put to a vote. BBC politics correspondent Iain Watson says the government is confident the Speaker will rule that the amendment is not sufficiently connected to the bill and therefore will not be debated. However, he says the Conservative rebels believe Sir Lindsay has not yet made up his mind. Voting on the bill will begin no later than 21:00 BST. It is not certain that the Speaker of the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle will allow a vote to go ahead later, but if he does, the numbers look very tricky for the government. First, plenty of backbenchers, and also privately some in the government, think that cutting aid right now is simply the wrong thing to do as a matter of principle. Next, the commitment to stick with spending 0.7% of GDP was in the Tory manifesto, and MPs don't like having to explain why promises have been broken. Thirdly, the cast list of those arguing to keep the commitment is full of well known Conservatives, including former prime ministers and cabinet ministers, who know how to get headlines, and how to organise. There are dozens of former ministers on the backbenches, who may not agree on everything but can agree on this, and are not exactly Mr Johnson's biggest fans. Lastly, the timing of this vote is awkward indeed. Mr Johnson is about to play host to the leaders of the free world at the G7. Does starting that week being beaten by his own backbenchers for reneging on a promise to the world's poorest sound tempting? Read more from Laura here. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown also criticised the cuts, telling BBC Breakfast it was ""a life and death issue"" and made ""no economic or moral sense"". Writing in the Guardian,,externalformer International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, who is leading the rebellion, said the UK is the only member of the G7 group of advanced economies cutting aid this year - and that ""contributing our fair share of aid is essential for a successful G7 summit"" this week. The aid reduction has meant millions of pounds less is being spent on supporting girls' education, reproductive health, clean water, HIV/AIDS, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and Syria, and hundreds of other projects. This video can not be played Sir Bob Geldof: ''We don't take the piece of bread from that child's mouth in Yemen'' Dozens of charities said there was ""no justifiable economic need"" for them ina letter to Mr Johnson over the weekend, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welbycalled the cuts ""indefensible"" on Twitter,,external. Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said the government would return to spending 0.7% levels ""when the fiscal situation allows"". She said the UK was a big aid donor but added: ""We have a duty to ensure we protect our citizens here as well as those in the rest of the world."" A senior government source told BBC political correspondent Chris Mason that if the amendment were to go through, it would be the equivalent of putting up income tax by a penny for every pound earned. And ex-Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued the UK shouldn't ""end up going into deeper debt in order to finance other countries"". Writing in the Telegraph,,externalshe said the UK should instead help poorer countries ""trade their way out of poverty"". ""If more and more aid was the solution, large parts of Africa would have escaped all poverty decades ago,"" she added.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says people in England aged 25-29 will be offered a Covid vaccine from tomorrow He adds data suggests vaccines work against the Delta variant, and that the vaccine ""brings us hope"" for the possible end of social distancing However, the health secretary says it is still too early to know whether England's 21 June lockdown easing can go ahead NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hails vaccinating people in their 20s as ""a watershed moment"" The UK has reported one further Covid death over the past 24 hours, as well as a further 5,683 cases Britons are scrambling for flights home from Portugal before the need to quarantine for 10 days comes into force early tomorrow Major Indian states that have been virus hotpots are easing restrictions as case numbers fall PM Boris Johnson faces opposition from senior Tories over government cuts to the UK's international aid budget Ministers argue it is hard to justify spending as much as promised, given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic Edited by James Clarke The live page has been brought to you today by Jennifer Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, Alexandra Fouche, Victoria Lindrea, Justin Parkinson and James Clarke. Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a round-up of the day's headlines: Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in January A grieving daughter has described her father as ""incredibly thankful"" after hospital staff arranged for him to spend time with his dying wife - despite them both being treated for Covid on different wards. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell,were able to see each other three timesat Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, in the five days before Mrs Jarrett's death in January. ""The meetings were an indescribable comfort. We were so lucky,"" said the couple's daughter, Chloe Keljarrett. Chloe says on 16 January, her mother told her ""today was the day"" and ""to be prepared"". Chloe recalls: ""The nurses instantly sprang into action and organised for dad to come up a final time. ""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home. This video can not be played UK tourists 'panicked' to get back from Portugal The education secretary goes on to say that, as well as supporting pupils, he wants to support teachers. He says: ""An extra Â£400m will be made available to help provide half a million teacher training opportunities across the country, alongside professional development for those working in early years settings. Williamson says he will ""make sure all of them can access high quality training"" - but does not specify how much the Â£400m works out at per teacher. He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"". Williamson concludes his statement by saying: ""As the prime minister said last week, there is going to be more [funding] coming down the track, but don't forget that this is a huge amount we are spending."" With the health secretary's statement to the Commons now over, we turn to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected. He says the government's total recovery package for education now totals Â£3bn. It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, has hailed tomorrow as ""a watershed moment"". Sir Simon describes the vaccination programme as entering ""the home straight"" after Health Secretary Matt Hancock says first doses of the vaccine would become available to 25-29-year-olds from Tuesday morning. ""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus. Matt Hancock announced that, from tomorrow, people in England aged 25-29 will be able to book a vaccination appointment. You can watch a clip from his statement below. This video can not be played Covid vaccines for 25 to 29-year-olds offered in England Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks why the health secretary is not ""ruling out"" lifting restrictions in England on 21 June. She also urges him to reverse the decision to end mask-wearing in schools. Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses. That means 40,460,576 people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both. Away from the Commons now, one death within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test result has been reported in the UK over the past 24 hours,official figures show.,external That takes the total number of UK deaths by that measure to 127,841 since the pandemic began. A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week. He asks the health secretary if he can ""give a milestone on when we can unlock international travel - and how can we give this industry and workforce hope for the future?"" Hancock says the government acted on the available bio-security advice, prompted by the presence of the variant Delta AW in Portugal. He agrees opening up international travel is ""challenging"", particularly because of the risk posed by new variants. ""Domestic freedom has to be protected at all costs,"" says Hancock. He stresses the need to protect the UK's borders: ""A variant that undermines the vaccine would put us in a much more difficult place as a country"".  Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson says the Covid data-collection programme - criticised by privacy campaigners - should be paused. Matt Hancock says he agrees that trust is important among NHS patients, but says data compilation is key to beating Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, has hailed tomorrow as ""a watershed moment"". Sir Simon describes the vaccination programme as entering ""the home straight"" after Health Secretary Matt Hancock says first doses of the vaccine would become available to 25-29-year-olds from Tuesday morning. ""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus.

She also urges him to reverse the decision to end mask-wearing in schools. Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses. That means 40,460,576 people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both.

A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week. He asks the health secretary if he can ""give a milestone on when we can unlock international travel - and how can we give this industry and workforce hope for the future?"" Hancock says the government acted on the available bio-security advice, prompted by the presence of the variant Delta AW in Portugal. He agrees opening up international travel is ""challenging"", particularly because of the risk posed by new variants. ""Domestic freedom has to be protected at all costs,"" says Hancock. He stresses the need to protect the UK's borders: ""A variant that undermines the vaccine would put us in a much more difficult place as a country"".  Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson says the Covid data-collection programme - criticised by privacy campaigners - should be paused. Matt Hancock says he agrees that trust is important among NHS patients, but says data compilation is key to beating Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a round-up of the day's headlines: Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in January A grieving daughter has described her father as ""incredibly thankful"" after hospital staff arranged for him to spend time with his dying wife - despite them both being treated for Covid on different wards. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell,were able to see each other three timesat Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, in the five days before Mrs Jarrett's death in January. ""The meetings were an indescribable comfort. We were so lucky,"" said the couple's daughter, Chloe Keljarrett. Chloe says on 16 January, her mother told her ""today was the day"" and ""to be prepared"". Chloe recalls: ""The nurses instantly sprang into action and organised for dad to come up a final time. ""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home. This video can not be played UK tourists 'panicked' to get back from Portugal The education secretary goes on to say that, as well as supporting pupils, he wants to support teachers. He says: ""An extra Â£400m will be made available to help provide half a million teacher training opportunities across the country, alongside professional development for those working in early years settings. Williamson says he will ""make sure all of them can access high quality training"" - but does not specify how much the Â£400m works out at per teacher. He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"". Williamson concludes his statement by saying: ""As the prime minister said last week, there is going to be more [funding] coming down the track, but don't forget that this is a huge amount we are spending."" With the health secretary's statement to the Commons now over, we turn to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected.

"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed comments made by the Culture Secretary that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) went ""over the top"" in suspending bowler Ollie Robinson for historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts, from 2012 and 2013 when Robinson was a teenager, were revealed while he was making his England debut during thedrawn first Testagainst New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped for the second Test, which begins at Edgbaston on Thursday, pending an investigation. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asked the ECB to ""think again"". Dowden said the tweets were ""offensive and wrong"" but ""also a decade old and written by a teenager"". A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said: ""The PM is supportive of Oliver Dowden's comments. As Dowden set out, these were comments made more than a decade ago written by someone as a teenager and for which they've rightly apologised."" The ECB will not be making any comment about Dowden's stance. England bowler Robinson suspended for historical tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play,he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" The ECB must determine whether Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent of the ECB, will carry out the investigation. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain David Gower agreed with Dowden, saying he did not think a suspension was the right way forward. ""The ECB should say 'let's learn from this' and make him do the equivalent of community service,"" said Gower. ""He should go out there among county cricketers and spread the word that social media shouldn't be abused."" However, Michael Carberry, who played six Tests for England between 2010 and 2014, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Robinson ""wouldn't be playing Test cricket"" if it was up to him. ""I don't believe this is a problem where you can rehabilitate someone,"" said Carberry. ""Robinson spoke about educating himself, but what is he talking about? I would be very interested to know."" At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport.

He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"".

Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected. He says the government's total recovery package for education now totals Â£3bn. It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding.

""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus.

Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses.

A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week. He asks the health secretary if he can ""give a milestone on when we can unlock international travel - and how can we give this industry and workforce hope for the future?"" Hancock says the government acted on the available bio-security advice, prompted by the presence of the variant Delta AW in Portugal. He agrees opening up international travel is ""challenging"", particularly because of the risk posed by new variants. ""Domestic freedom has to be protected at all costs,"" says Hancock. He stresses the need to protect the UK's borders: ""A variant that undermines the vaccine would put us in a much more difficult place as a country"".  Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson says the Covid data-collection programme - criticised by privacy campaigners - should be paused. Matt Hancock says he agrees that trust is important among NHS patients, but says data compilation is key to beating Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed comments made by the Culture Secretary that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) went ""over the top"" in suspending bowler Ollie Robinson for historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts, from 2012 and 2013 when Robinson was a teenager, were revealed while he was making his England debut during thedrawn first Testagainst New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped for the second Test, which begins at Edgbaston on Thursday, pending an investigation. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asked the ECB to ""think again"". Dowden said the tweets were ""offensive and wrong"" but ""also a decade old and written by a teenager"". A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said: ""The PM is supportive of Oliver Dowden's comments. As Dowden set out, these were comments made more than a decade ago written by someone as a teenager and for which they've rightly apologised."" The ECB will not be making any comment about Dowden's stance. England bowler Robinson suspended for historical tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play,he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" The ECB must determine whether Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent of the ECB, will carry out the investigation. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain David Gower agreed with Dowden, saying he did not think a suspension was the right way forward. ""The ECB should say 'let's learn from this' and make him do the equivalent of community service,"" said Gower. ""He should go out there among county cricketers and spread the word that social media shouldn't be abused."" However, Michael Carberry, who played six Tests for England between 2010 and 2014, told BBC Radio 5 Live that Robinson ""wouldn't be playing Test cricket"" if it was up to him. ""I don't believe this is a problem where you can rehabilitate someone,"" said Carberry. ""Robinson spoke about educating himself, but what is he talking about? I would be very interested to know."" At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport. ""We've started doing a lot of good work as a team and we'll continue to do that. We want to make the game as inclusive and diverse as we possibly can and we'll continue to keep looking at finding ways to make that possible.""

Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a round-up of the day's headlines: Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in January A grieving daughter has described her father as ""incredibly thankful"" after hospital staff arranged for him to spend time with his dying wife - despite them both being treated for Covid on different wards. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell,were able to see each other three timesat Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, in the five days before Mrs Jarrett's death in January. ""The meetings were an indescribable comfort. We were so lucky,"" said the couple's daughter, Chloe Keljarrett. Chloe says on 16 January, her mother told her ""today was the day"" and ""to be prepared"". Chloe recalls: ""The nurses instantly sprang into action and organised for dad to come up a final time. ""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home.

"This video can not be played UK tourists say the rush to return from Portugal ""put everybody on a downer"" British holidaymakers in Portugal are rushing back home before the country is added to the UK's travel amber list amid concerns about rising Covid cases. From 04:00 BST on Tuesday Portugal will be dropped from the green list, and returnees made to self-isolate for 10 days and take two PCR tests. Airlines have added extra capacity, with British Airways and EasyJet saying there are seats available. But people are reporting difficulties in getting pre-departure tests. Bookings to Portugal soared last month after it was placed on the green list, meaning UK residents could travel there without having to quarantine on their return. The government last Thursday announced Portugal would move to the amber list. The Department for Transport cited a near doubling of positive Covid cases in Portugal in the last three weeks, and concerns about the detection of a mutation of the Delta variant first identified in India. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""tough"" rules on travel were necessary to protect the success of the UK's vaccine rollout. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? 'It's not just holidays, I miss my family abroad' Can we get our money back if we can't go on holiday? Thirty-nine flights will leave Faro Airport in the Algarve for the UK on Monday, nearly twice the usual total, but ticket prices are significantly higher than later in the week. BA said passengers can change to a different flight free of charge by rebooking through its website, while EasyJet says it will not charge fees for switching flights. However, the UK move has seen some passengers struggle to obtain proof of the negative Covid test needed before they can return to the UK. Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley, from Derby, arrived for an eight-day break in the Algarve just before the change to the amber list was announced, and say it was ""almost impossible"" for them to return. ""To say we are incensed is an understatement,"" said Mr Stanley. ""We have been unable to get any return flights... We now have to do a further two tests at an additional cost to the three tests we have paid for if we want to come out of isolation after five days."" Angela Mantana and Craig Stanley were unable to obtain Covid tests Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Mantana added: ""We've got to finish the holiday and then go into quarantine when we get back. ""The implications are we are volunteers at a vaccine centre... we've had to let those people down. Equally I shield an aunty who has severe medical conditions... and I'm not going to be able to do that."" This is exactly what the travel industry had hoped to avoid this summer. They thought the roll-out of the vaccine would bring more consistency, as would the government's introduction of a watch list, intended to signal to potential passengers that a country could be on the verge of tipping from green to amber. But the government has shown that when it is concerned about letting in variants, it can and will close the doors as it did last summer. It has led to huge frustration in the travel sector and made many nervous about how strong sales will be this summer, the crucial season for the industry. Some are already calling for furlough to be extended beyond September into the winter. Most crucially for those running the operations is understanding how and why countries are moved between lists, something they say the government needs to be more transparent about. The government would disagree, saying it always been about the vaccine, variants, the virus and genomic sequencing. The next list is expected in a few weeks' time. Between now and then there will be pressure from industry for the government to open up or offer them sector specific support. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes Meanwhile, a holidaymaker who flew back on Sunday has described ""chaotic"" scenes at Faro airport. Mike Indian says he heard the final calls for his flight back to London Luton while in a long queue. Other passengers let him and many others move to the front. ""The moment the bag goes down the chute it's like the starting pistol and there's dozens of us running through Faro airport and up the escalators,"" he told the BBC. ""We finally reached the gate but we made it with five minutes to spare."" Gary Turner says he endured long waits at Faro Airport Gary and Cassie Turner from Epsom, who ended their holiday in Carvoeiro on the Algarve on Sunday, had a three-hour wait at the Faro check-in desk. ""There were people being told that if they had missed their flight because they had been queuing for so long that they had to book another,"" Mr Turner said. ""When we boarded we were then stuck on the tarmac for another three hours while other passengers were rounded up, and when they couldn't wait any longer they also had to take bags off the plane."" Alis Ahmedova and her fiance, from Beckenham, London, arrived back from Lisbon on Sunday night. ""We received the news that Portugal is no longer a green list country. This was the beginning of the end for us. After some deliberation, we decided to change our flight and cut our holiday short."" But she said they were initially refused boarding and missed their flight home because of difficulties with thepassenger locator form,externalthat all travellers to the UK need to complete. ""We tried everything... but the form was not accepting our seat numbers and Covid test reference numbers."" Alan and Lisa Pechey, from Cambridge, who were also in Lisbon, told the PA news agency they spent Â£800 on return flights to avoid quarantine. Speaking from Gatwick Airport, Mrs Pechey, 66, said: ""The government was totally unfair to throw that at us on Thursday because it really spoiled our holiday, totally... they should have told us to watch out if we were going to Portugal so everyone would have known."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area On 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. Portugal said it could not understand the ""logic"" of the UK move, and argued the pandemic situations were very similar in the two countries. Its national hotels association says about half of bookings in the Algarve for June were cancelled within hours of the UK announcement. Tim Alderslade from industry body Airlines UK said ""three months in the summer"" now appeared to be the ""best case scenario"" for travel companies, and they could end up seeking further government financial support.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says people in England aged 25-29 will be offered a Covid vaccine from tomorrow He adds data suggests vaccines work against the Delta variant, and that the vaccine ""brings us hope"" for the possible end of social distancing However, the health secretary says it is still too early to know whether England's 21 June lockdown easing can go ahead NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hails vaccinating people in their 20s as ""a watershed moment"" The UK has reported one further Covid death over the past 24 hours, as well as a further 5,683 cases Britons are scrambling for flights home from Portugal before the need to quarantine for 10 days comes into force early tomorrow Major Indian states that have been virus hotpots are easing restrictions as case numbers fall PM Boris Johnson faces opposition from senior Tories over government cuts to the UK's international aid budget Ministers argue it is hard to justify spending as much as promised, given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic Edited by James Clarke The live page has been brought to you today by Jennifer Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, Alexandra Fouche, Victoria Lindrea, Justin Parkinson and James Clarke. Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a round-up of the day's headlines: Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in January A grieving daughter has described her father as ""incredibly thankful"" after hospital staff arranged for him to spend time with his dying wife - despite them both being treated for Covid on different wards. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell,were able to see each other three timesat Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, in the five days before Mrs Jarrett's death in January. ""The meetings were an indescribable comfort. We were so lucky,"" said the couple's daughter, Chloe Keljarrett. Chloe says on 16 January, her mother told her ""today was the day"" and ""to be prepared"". Chloe recalls: ""The nurses instantly sprang into action and organised for dad to come up a final time. ""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home. This video can not be played UK tourists 'panicked' to get back from Portugal The education secretary goes on to say that, as well as supporting pupils, he wants to support teachers. He says: ""An extra Â£400m will be made available to help provide half a million teacher training opportunities across the country, alongside professional development for those working in early years settings. Williamson says he will ""make sure all of them can access high quality training"" - but does not specify how much the Â£400m works out at per teacher. He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"". Williamson concludes his statement by saying: ""As the prime minister said last week, there is going to be more [funding] coming down the track, but don't forget that this is a huge amount we are spending."" With the health secretary's statement to the Commons now over, we turn to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected. He says the government's total recovery package for education now totals Â£3bn. It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, has hailed tomorrow as ""a watershed moment"". Sir Simon describes the vaccination programme as entering ""the home straight"" after Health Secretary Matt Hancock says first doses of the vaccine would become available to 25-29-year-olds from Tuesday morning. ""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus. Matt Hancock announced that, from tomorrow, people in England aged 25-29 will be able to book a vaccination appointment. You can watch a clip from his statement below. This video can not be played Covid vaccines for 25 to 29-year-olds offered in England Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks why the health secretary is not ""ruling out"" lifting restrictions in England on 21 June. She also urges him to reverse the decision to end mask-wearing in schools. Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses. That means 40,460,576 people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both. Away from the Commons now, one death within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test result has been reported in the UK over the past 24 hours,official figures show.,external That takes the total number of UK deaths by that measure to 127,841 since the pandemic began. A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week. He asks the health secretary if he can ""give a milestone on when we can unlock international travel - and how can we give this industry and workforce hope for the future?"" Hancock says the government acted on the available bio-security advice, prompted by the presence of the variant Delta AW in Portugal. He agrees opening up international travel is ""challenging"", particularly because of the risk posed by new variants. ""Domestic freedom has to be protected at all costs,"" says Hancock. He stresses the need to protect the UK's borders: ""A variant that undermines the vaccine would put us in a much more difficult place as a country"".  Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson says the Covid data-collection programme - criticised by privacy campaigners - should be paused. Matt Hancock says he agrees that trust is important among NHS patients, but says data compilation is key to beating Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed comments made by the Culture Secretary that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) went ""over the top"" in suspending bowler Ollie Robinson for historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts, from 2012 and 2013 when Robinson was a teenager, were revealed while he was making his England debut during thedrawn first Testagainst New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped for the second Test, which begins at Edgbaston on Thursday, pending an investigation. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden asked the ECB to ""think again"". Dowden said the tweets were ""offensive and wrong"" but ""also a decade old and written by a teenager"". A spokesperson for Mr Johnson said: ""The PM is supportive of Oliver Dowden's comments. As Dowden set out, these were comments made more than a decade ago written by someone as a teenager and for which they've rightly apologised.""

"The Queen is ""delighted"" after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced the birth of their second child, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, Buckingham Palace has said. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge also congratulated the couple on social media. The Queen's 11th great-grandchild was born on Friday at a hospital in Santa Barbara, California. Lilibet was the Queen's nickname when she was a child. Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been informed and are delighted with the news."" Prince Charles, Prince Harry's father, and the Duchess of Cornwalltweeted,external: ""Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie on the arrival of baby Lilibet Diana. Wishing them all well at this special time."" Prince William and the Duchess and Cambridge said: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent his ""many congratulations"" to the couple and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the ""wonderful news"". Royal Family tree and line of succession Profile: Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex Lilibet was born at 11:40am local time, weighing 7 lbs 11oz. She is eighth in line to the throne - meaning Prince Andrew, who was born as second in line in 1960, moves down to ninth place. Lilibet - the Queen's family nickname - was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and could not pronounce her name properly. Her grandfather, King George V, would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her own attempts to say her name. It soon stuck and she became Lilibet to her family from then on. The Queen, pictured here with her grandparents in 1932, was called Lilibet by her grandfather King George V Prince Harry and Meghan said their baby's middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales. In a message of thanks on the couple's Archewell website, they said: ""On June 4, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. ""She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe. ""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family."" The message adds that anyone wishing to send gifts is asked to ""support or learn more about"" organisations working for women and girls. They have not released any photos of their daughter. This video can not be played Residents in Montecito, where the couple live, react to news of the birth Use of the ""very special and intimate"" name Lilibet will not have come as a surprise to the Queen, according to Sunday Times royal editor Roya Nikkhah who suggested the monarch would have been asked or informed of the choice beforehand. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's that very intimate name that the Queen has used since she was very little and for me I thought perhaps this is a diplomatic olive branch offered to the Royal Family after what has been a fractious year between Harry and Meghan and the rest of the Royal Family."" Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, met on a blind date and married in May 2018 in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. They welcomed their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, a year later. Meghan's friend, Misan Harriman, who took black-and-white photographs of the couple for their pregnancy announcement, tweeted his congratulations: ""Lilibet has arrived! Congratulations to my brave friend and her lovely family!"" The couple, pictured here with their son Archie, announced on Valentine's Day in February they were expecting their second child Prince Harry has publicly reflected on his approach to parenthood recently, sayinghe wanted to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering""of his upbringing with his own children. He and Meghan quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020. Speaking last month, the duke said moving to the US had not been part of the plan, but he felt he had to put his family and mental health first. As a result of the move, Lilibet is the most senior royal in the current line of succession to be born overseas. Like her older brother Archie and most of the Queen's great-grandchildren, she is not eligible to have a royal title. Under rules laid out more than 100 years ago, she would not be allowed to be a princess nor an HRH until Prince Charles becomes king. In November, Meghanrevealed she had a miscarriageseveral months earlier, writing about her ""almost unbearable grief"" in a deeply personal article for the New York Times. In the piece, she said ""despite the staggering commonality of [miscarriages], the conversation remains taboo, riddled with [unwarranted] shame"" and went on to commend those who ""bravely shared their stories"", saying: ""When one person speaks truth, it gives license for all of us to do the same.""

"Qantas said it was ""disturbed"" by claims that some staff may have been involved in organised crime following an Australian media report that gangs had ""infiltrated"" the airline. The Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes reported,externalthe allegations based on a classified intelligence operation. It said agencies believe organised crime groups had infiltrated Qantas to facilitate illegal activities. In a statement Qantas said authorities had not raised any concerns. The BBC approached Australian authorities for comment on the report. The Nine newspapers said the classified intelligence operation found up to 150 Qantas staff had been linked to criminality. It said agencies believe they included motorcycle gangs that were involved in drug importation and other activities. The report said the suspected wrongdoing was ""serious and represents a very high threat to the Australian border"". The Nine newspapers said official sources briefed on the findings were unable to speak publicly ""due to confidentiality requirements"". The allegations include that one motorcycle gang affiliate is working at Qantas' Sydney airport operations and may have recruited criminals to the airline to help import narcotics. Federal Labor opposition politicians Kristina Keneally and Catherine King called for an ""urgent review"" of security at Australia's airports following the report. ""The untold story of Covid-19 is that organised crime syndicates have not only adapted but thrived in the Covid-era, all while the Morrison Government has been asleep at the wheel on airport security,"" a statement from Ms Keneally and Ms King said. In a statement, Qantas said it found the claims ""disturbing"". ""To be clear, none of Australia's law enforcement agencies have told us of the existence of a report that suggests there are potentially 150 Qantas employees who have connections to organised crime. Nor have they raised concerns with us about our vetting or background checking processes,"" Qantas Group Chief Security Officer Luke Bramah said in a statement. ""If concerns are raised regarding any of our employees, we will actively support their investigation and take appropriate action,"" Mr Bramah said. The airline said it had written to multiple agencies - including the Australian Federal Police and the country's Criminal Intelligence Commission - seeking details of the report. It also said Qantas is the only commercial airline that holds a ""Trusted Trader accreditation"" with Australian Border Force, which means all employees involved in international air freight must pass a fit and proper test. ""We've not been advised by Border Force of any of our employees failing this test,"" Mr Bramah said. Still, the newspaper said that official sources briefed on the report said Australian intelligence agencies had found some Qantas staff were creating ""vulnerabilities in the security of supply chains and critical infrastructure"" that risks on harming public confidence in the airline and border security. The allegations come in a difficult period for Australia's national carrier. It has been hit hard by the pandemic and last month said it would report an annual loss before tax of more than $1.5bn (A$2bn, Â£1.1bn). Like many others, the airline has cut thousands of jobs in a bid to navigate the crisis that has devastated travel.

"The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Families are going hungry and girls are missing school because of the UK's cuts to foreign aid spending, dozens of charities and academics have warned. Charities including Oxfam and ActionAid UK said they had caused ""devastation"" that could undermine the UK's credibility at the upcoming G7 summit. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said there was ""no justifiable economic need"" for cuts of almost Â£4bn a year. The government says it will still spend more than Â£10bn on foreign aid in 2021. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it was a ""temporary"" reduction, which was ""entirely reasonable"" given that the pandemic had caused a ""once-in-300-year economic interruption"".

More Conservative rebels join bid to reverse cuts The letter comes ahead of a potential Commons vote on Monday when more than 30 rebel Tory MPs, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, hope to reverse the cuts. Last year, ministers decided to reduce this year's spending on overseas aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%,saying it was hard to justify,given that the UK faces record levels of peacetime borrowing to cope with the pandemic. This video can not be played Sir Bob Geldof: ''We don't take the piece of bread from that child's mouth in Yemen'' But charities including Save the Children, WWF UK and Cafod said the reduction had already led to the closure of feeding centres and clinics - and forced the cancellation of projects including water sanitation and training for healthcare workers. The letter - signed by more than 1,700 academics, charities and business leaders - was shared with the BBC as the UK prepares to welcome leaders from the G7 group of major advanced economies to a summit in Cornwall. ""While other G7 countries have stepped up their aid budget, the UK is the only one to have rowed back on its commitments,"" it said. The letter added that doing this during the pandemic was a ""double blow to the world's poorest communities"". The UK gave Â£1.5bn humanitarian aid - short-term help in an immediate crises - in 2019, in in projects like this one by the World Food Programme in Yemen Foreign aid is resources given from one country to another. It can involve a transfer of things like food or equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help. In 2020, the UK spent Â£14.5bn on aid, meeting its 0.7% target,according to provisional data,external. Overall, the top five recipients were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia. The government has pledged to restore aid spending to 0.7% ""when the fiscal situation allows"" - but it has not specified a date. Ministers cut the spending without changing a 2015 law which made the 0.7% target legally binding. More than 30 Conservative rebels, including former ministers Damian Green, Stephen Crabb and Johnny Mercer, say they are planning to reverse the cuts on Monday by voting to amend legislation related to a newscientific research agency. Their amendment - which will need the support of more Tory MPs to pass - would oblige the agency to make up any shortfall from the 0.7% target from January 2022. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether the amendment is within the scope of the bill and whether it should be put to a vote. Anti-poverty campaigner Sir Bob Geldof told the Andrew Marr Show said of the aid cut: ""It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense economically, financially, politically, diplomatically, morally or in the humanitarian consequences of it. ""And I'm very much afraid that something that we're told is temporary will become permanent."" Mr Hancock said: ""The decisions that the government has taken around this are entirely reasonable. We face a once-in-300-year economic interruption."" He added that much of the work done by the UK, including distributing vaccines to other countries ""at cost"", did not officially ""count as aid"".

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says people in England aged 25-29 will be offered a Covid vaccine from tomorrow He adds data suggests vaccines work against the Delta variant, and that the vaccine ""brings us hope"" for the possible end of social distancing However, the health secretary says it is still too early to know whether England's 21 June lockdown easing can go ahead NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hails vaccinating people in their 20s as ""a watershed moment"" The UK has reported one further Covid death over the past 24 hours, as well as a further 5,683 cases Britons are scrambling for flights home from Portugal before the need to quarantine for 10 days comes into force early tomorrow Major Indian states that have been virus hotpots are easing restrictions as case numbers fall PM Boris Johnson faces opposition from senior Tories over government cuts to the UK's international aid budget Ministers argue it is hard to justify spending as much as promised, given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic Edited by James Clarke The live page has been brought to you today by Jennifer Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, Alexandra Fouche, Victoria Lindrea, Justin Parkinson and James Clarke. Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a round-up of the day's headlines: Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in January A grieving daughter has described her father as ""incredibly thankful"" after hospital staff arranged for him to spend time with his dying wife - despite them both being treated for Covid on different wards. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell,were able to see each other three timesat Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, in the five days before Mrs Jarrett's death in January. ""The meetings were an indescribable comfort. We were so lucky,"" said the couple's daughter, Chloe Keljarrett. Chloe says on 16 January, her mother told her ""today was the day"" and ""to be prepared"". Chloe recalls: ""The nurses instantly sprang into action and organised for dad to come up a final time. ""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home. This video can not be played UK tourists 'panicked' to get back from Portugal The education secretary goes on to say that, as well as supporting pupils, he wants to support teachers. He says: ""An extra Â£400m will be made available to help provide half a million teacher training opportunities across the country, alongside professional development for those working in early years settings. Williamson says he will ""make sure all of them can access high quality training"" - but does not specify how much the Â£400m works out at per teacher. He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"". Williamson concludes his statement by saying: ""As the prime minister said last week, there is going to be more [funding] coming down the track, but don't forget that this is a huge amount we are spending."" With the health secretary's statement to the Commons now over, we turn to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected. He says the government's total recovery package for education now totals Â£3bn. It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, has hailed tomorrow as ""a watershed moment"". Sir Simon describes the vaccination programme as entering ""the home straight"" after Health Secretary Matt Hancock says first doses of the vaccine would become available to 25-29-year-olds from Tuesday morning. ""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus. Matt Hancock announced that, from tomorrow, people in England aged 25-29 will be able to book a vaccination appointment. You can watch a clip from his statement below. This video can not be played Covid vaccines for 25 to 29-year-olds offered in England Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks why the health secretary is not ""ruling out"" lifting restrictions in England on 21 June. She also urges him to reverse the decision to end mask-wearing in schools. Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses. That means 40,460,576 people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both. Away from the Commons now, one death within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test result has been reported in the UK over the past 24 hours,official figures show.,external That takes the total number of UK deaths by that measure to 127,841 since the pandemic began. A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week. He asks the health secretary if he can ""give a milestone on when we can unlock international travel - and how can we give this industry and workforce hope for the future?"" Hancock says the government acted on the available bio-security advice, prompted by the presence of the variant Delta AW in Portugal. He agrees opening up international travel is ""challenging"", particularly because of the risk posed by new variants. ""Domestic freedom has to be protected at all costs,"" says Hancock. He stresses the need to protect the UK's borders: ""A variant that undermines the vaccine would put us in a much more difficult place as a country"".  Liberal Democrat Munira Wilson says the Covid data-collection programme - criticised by privacy campaigners - should be paused. Matt Hancock says he agrees that trust is important among NHS patients, but says data compilation is key to beating Covid. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Tinder will offer a selection of Covid vaccine status badges including ""vaccinated"" and ""vaxing soon"" UK online daters will be able to choose to display a badge on their profiles to show if they have been vaccinated against Covid or support the jab drive. However there will be no way of verifying whether those displaying the badge have genuinely had the vaccine. Tinder, Match, Hinge, Bumble, Badoo, Plenty of Fish, OurTime and Muzmatch have all signed up to the scheme, in partnership with the UK government. The idea of vaccine badges on dating apps was launched in the US in May. Some of the apps are including additional incentives for those who say they are vaccinated - such as free credits or access to premium features that usually cost extra, like profile boosts, virtual rose giving and ""super likes"". Bumble will also enable its members to share pandemic dating preferences such as views on social distancing, mask-wearing and whether users are comfortable meeting in crowded places. Iâm under 30 - which Covid vaccine will I get? Bumble's profile includes ""Covid preferences"" in terms of how a potential date might work. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi described the new initiative as an ""incredible asset"" to the UK's Covid-19 vaccination programme. A recent YouGov poll of nearly 5,000 UK adults,externalfound that only 28% of those who responded said they would not date someone unvaccinated, with 2% saying they would not date someone who had received the jab. In England and Wales people aged over 30 are now eligible for the vaccine. In Northern Ireland and Wales it is available to everyone over 18. The government says thataround 40 million people have received at least one of the two doses so far. However, there are some concerns around vaccine status and privacy. Last monththe NHS revised its booking system in Englandafter complaints that it was possible to work out how many jabs an individual had received, by inputting basic details such as their name and postcode. Privacy campaigner Dr Stephanie Hare said that because the dating app badge is voluntary and no official documentation is required, the privacy risk is low.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says people in England aged 25-29 will be offered a Covid vaccine from tomorrow He adds data suggests vaccines work against the Delta variant, and that the vaccine ""brings us hope"" for the possible end of social distancing However, the health secretary says it is still too early to know whether England's 21 June lockdown easing can go ahead NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens hails vaccinating people in their 20s as ""a watershed moment"" The UK has reported one further Covid death over the past 24 hours, as well as a further 5,683 cases Britons are scrambling for flights home from Portugal before the need to quarantine for 10 days comes into force early tomorrow Major Indian states that have been virus hotpots are easing restrictions as case numbers fall PM Boris Johnson faces opposition from senior Tories over government cuts to the UK's international aid budget Ministers argue it is hard to justify spending as much as promised, given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic Edited by James Clarke The live page has been brought to you today by Jennifer Meierhans, Hamish Mackay, Alexandra Fouche, Victoria Lindrea, Justin Parkinson and James Clarke. Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a round-up of the day's headlines: Gerry and Barbara Jarrett were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in January A grieving daughter has described her father as ""incredibly thankful"" after hospital staff arranged for him to spend time with his dying wife - despite them both being treated for Covid on different wards. Gerry and Barbara Jarrett, from Bracknell,were able to see each other three timesat Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, in the five days before Mrs Jarrett's death in January. ""The meetings were an indescribable comfort. We were so lucky,"" said the couple's daughter, Chloe Keljarrett. Chloe says on 16 January, her mother told her ""today was the day"" and ""to be prepared"". Chloe recalls: ""The nurses instantly sprang into action and organised for dad to come up a final time. ""He was able to stay while she was awake and we were able to chat with mum until she and dad grew tired, at which point they said their goodbyes."" Chloe adds her father's lungs ""are almost fully recovered"". ""He's looking better now than he did before Covid,"" she says.  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The data emerging this week will be crucial in determining to
what extent restrictions can be eased further. In particular, the government and its scientists will be looking
at the hospital figures. And the data released today provides both good and bad news. In the House of Commons, Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an
update on hospital admissions linked to the Delta variant. Of more than 100 people in hospital that have been identified as
having an infection caused by the variant (not every positive case is checked)
just three had had two jabs. Given that the people who have had both doses are the most at
risk of ending up seriously ill those figures are incredibly encouraging. And it chimes with what hospital bosses have been saying - that
a much larger proportion of people being admitted now are younger and less
seriously ill than they were earlier in the pandemic. But it is also a reminder that as infection levels go up people
will still end up seriously ill. There are early signs the overall numbers in
hospital may be starting to rise - there are now 860 in hospital in England,
nearly 90 more than there was a week ago. This, of course, is just a fraction of the 34,000 in hospital in
the January peak. But it shows what a delicate balancing act ministers have as
they ponder easing restrictions further. Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green accuses Gavin Williamson and the government of ""failing to rise to the challenge"" with the education recovery programme. She says the government has failed staff, parents and pupils. She says ""children and young people have been betrayed"" - by Williamson and the prime minister who she says had not stood up to the Chancellor ""to prioritise the investment needed for their future"". Green laments the Â£3bn package - comparing the Â£50 allocated to every pupil in England to the Â£1,600 and Â£2,500 she says has been allocated in the US and Netherlands respectively. Green says the programme failed to take action in areas where it was most needed - such as addressing mental health issues and boosting recreational activities - and says funding is needed to make up for ""stealth"" cuts to pupil premium funding.  Holidaymakers have been scrambling to get home before Portugal is added to the UK's travel amber list, which would require them to isolate for 10 days. Some of them have been speaking to the BBC about their decision to fly home. This video can not be played UK tourists 'panicked' to get back from Portugal The education secretary goes on to say that, as well as supporting pupils, he wants to support teachers. He says: ""An extra Â£400m will be made available to help provide half a million teacher training opportunities across the country, alongside professional development for those working in early years settings. Williamson says he will ""make sure all of them can access high quality training"" - but does not specify how much the Â£400m works out at per teacher. He adds that ""by investing in our teachers... we don't just invest in them but in every pupil in every class"". Williamson concludes his statement by saying: ""As the prime minister said last week, there is going to be more [funding] coming down the track, but don't forget that this is a huge amount we are spending."" With the health secretary's statement to the Commons now over, we turn to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Williamson tells MPs helping children and their education recover from the pandemic is an ""absolute priority"". He says 250,000 children will receive tutoring this year who would not have received it otherwise. Williamson adds evidence shows disadvantaged children and those areas hard hit by Covid - such as the north of England - are among those most likely to have been affected. He says the government's total recovery package for education now totals Â£3bn. It comes after the education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, has hailed tomorrow as ""a watershed moment"". Sir Simon describes the vaccination programme as entering ""the home straight"" after Health Secretary Matt Hancock says first doses of the vaccine would become available to 25-29-year-olds from Tuesday morning. ""The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,"" says the NHS boss. âThe tireless efforts of NHS staff to protect the people they care for and their communities has quite simply saved lives, and when you get the text, youâre next."" Sir Simon says NHS staff were delivering jabs at more than 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship and sport stadiums. âGetting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do."" Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey asks how the ""adaptability"" of coronavirus, in all its variants, can be countered. Matt Hancock responds that the different UK administrations have put in a big ""team effort"" and that ""a lot"" of people are doing ""excellent"" work together. He adds he is ""grateful"" to all those involved. That ends the health secretary's Commons appearance, during which he answered 31 questions. Labour's Barbara Keeley calls the scheme to gather more information on Covid a ""data grab"" and says the government should ""publicise"" how people can ""opt out"" of giving information. Matt Hancock replies that this is all about ""how we can save lives"", which is the ""NHS's historic mission"". Conservative Esther McVey asks how many more hospital beds are available in the NHS than in March last year. Matt Hancock does not give a figure, but replies that most of the growth was in the Nightingale hospitals, set up to deal with the demands of the pandemic. He adds that, ""all the way through"", no one was denied treatment. Labour's Derek Twigg says the government must be ""clear"" in future on what's happening regarding overseas travel, as hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it. Matt Hancock says he's taking a ""cautious"" approach, adding that this is sensible. Conservative Mark Harper says that, if social distancing is not ended on 21 June in England, easing of restrictions will not have ""gone anywhere close"" to normal. He asks how effective vaccine jabs are at lowering the risk of serious illness and death. The health secretary says he doesn't have the ""precise figures in my head"" and promises to give more detail at Health Questions in the Commons on Tuesday.  If you're just joining us now, the health secretary has been speaking to MPs about the latest in the UK's fight against coronavirus. Matt Hancock announced that, from tomorrow, people in England aged 25-29 will be able to book a vaccination appointment. You can watch a clip from his statement below. This video can not be played Covid vaccines for 25 to 29-year-olds offered in England Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks why the health secretary is not ""ruling out"" lifting restrictions in England on 21 June. She also urges him to reverse the decision to end mask-wearing in schools. Matt Hancock says he doesn't understand Lucas's argument, adding he will be influenced by the data the government will receive over the next week before making a decision. As we just mentioned, the UK has recorded more than 5,000 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. With regards to first vaccine doses, 127,345 were administered across the UK over the past 24 hours, as well as 259,941 second doses. That means 40,460,576 people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while 27,921,294 have received both. Away from the Commons now, one death within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test result has been reported in the UK over the past 24 hours,official figures show.,external That takes the total number of UK deaths by that measure to 127,841 since the pandemic began. A further 5,683 positive Covid cases have also been identified in the UK over the past 24 hours. Conservative MP Huw Merriman asks what happened to the government's promised green watch list - in light of the swift removal of Portugal from the green list to the amber list last week.

"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets England pace bowler Ollie Robinson has been suspended from international cricket pending an investigation into historical racist and sexist tweets. The posts from 2012 and 2013 were revealed while he was making his England debut during the drawn first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. Robinson, 27, has been dropped from the squad for the second Test, which begins on Thursday at Edgbaston. He will leave the England camp on Sunday and return to his county Sussex. The tweets, posted when Robinson was aged 18 and 19, came to light on Wednesday afternoon, while he was on the field. After play, he apologised, saying he was ""embarrassed"" and ""ashamed"". ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist."" Robinson apologises for racist and sexist tweets England turn down chase to grind out drawn against New Zealand At the conclusion of the match on Sunday, England captain Joe Root said the tweets were ""not acceptable"". ""Ollie has made a huge mistake,"" Root told BBC Test Match Special. ""He fronted up to the dressing room and the rest of the world, and he's very remorseful."" Robinson returned match figures of 7-101 and scored 42 in his only innings against New Zealand. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""He has got to go away, learn and educate himself - and become a better person for it. ""In terms of what he has delivered on the cricket field, he is a Test-match player. He will certainly be back playing Test cricket."" On the morning his tweets were shared online, England shared a 'moment of unity' with the tourists, with Root's side wearing T-shirts carrying messages of anti-discrimination. ""It's a lesson to everyone in the game,"" added Root. ""More has to be done, that continued education and learning about how to behave in society and within our sport. ""We've started doing a lot of good work as a team and we'll continue to do that. We want to make the game as inclusive and diverse as we possibly can and we'll continue to keep looking at finding ways to make that possible."" The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) must determine if Robinson was contracted at the time of the tweets, which cover a period when he left Kent and joined Yorkshire. If he did not have a contract, the investigation will be carried out by the ECB. If Robinson had a county contract at the time, the Cricket Discipline Commission, which is independent from the ECB, will carry out the investigation.

"Customers complained of packed carriages on a train to Abergavenny Calls have been made for the Welsh government to investigate after images of packed trains emerged online. Passengers complained of feeling unsafe after Covid travel restrictions were eased. Pictures shared showed people standing in crowded carriages, unable to social distance during the hot weather. Transport for Wales (TfW) said it monitored capacity and that safety was a ""top priority"". Arfon MP Hywel Williams has said constituents had complained about TfW services along the north Wales coast to Bangor beingÂ dangerous. He said TfW and the Welsh government should ""urgently review"" their onboard Covid safety protocols. ""I understand from passengers that some services originating in Crewe over the weekend were at full capacity, with no means of properly enforcing social distancing measures, leaving those onboard with no alternative but to sit side by side and stand in the aisles,"" said Plaid MP Mr Williams. 'Urgent change' to get people back on trains Â£62m needed to keep Transport for Wales afloat Trains overcrowded 'during hot weather' ""This dire service is bad enough under normal circumstances, but to expect passengers to endure cramped conditions for over two hours on a poorly ventilated train with next to no social distancing in the middle of a public health crisis, is a disgrace."" Social distancing measures are a legal requirement on trains and everyone on board is required to wear a face covering by law, unless they have a valid excuse. TfW introduced an improved rail service between Cardiff and Holyhead with more capacity on Monday, and bought 30 further carriages with Welsh government help. Transport experts and green campaigners had warned safety messaging about avoiding public transport could have a ""lasting impact"" andit could take years for passengers to get back on board regularlyunless people felt safe. Passengers called the overcrowding on the Barry to Cardiff service on bank holiday Monday ""a disgrace"" However, commuters have tweeted photos of packed carriages, with aisles filled with people standing, as passengers travelled back from days and nights out, and work, in recent weeks. Adam Smith said he felt ""anxious"" after getting on a train back to his home in Newport from Barry Island on bank holiday Monday which had standing room only. As the sun shone on bank holiday Monday, thousands flocked to beaches and beauty spots across Wales, with many using public transport. However, the train leaving Barry was standing room only and Mr Smith said he was shocked there were only two carriages on a busy bank holiday. ""There must have been about 100 people waiting to get on, it was stupidly crowded,"" he said. With fans now allowed back to festivals, matches and concerts when restrictions ease on Monday, Mr Smith said he assumed TfW would have put extra trains on and changed services after seeing how busy it was on the journey out. He said while everyone was wearing facemasks on board, he was ""anxious and uncomfortable"", but had no other way to get home. Allow Twitter content?

""I am now questioning, especially for a long journey, whether I should get the train,"" he said. ""People like me rely on public transport, we need more trains or carriages on so we can be safe while travelling because if we don't travel that will impact other industries if people are feeling it's not safe to travel."" Lesley Griffiths, Minister for North Wales, travelled on the first new train leaving Holyhead on Monday morning and said it was a ""positive step towards encouraging more people back on the train"". There will also be new trains on the Swansea to Manchester route from December 2022. Passenger numbers on Welsh trains have risen dramatically over the past 20 years, leading to commuters complaining of packed carriages and late services, pre-Covid. As ""non-essential"" travel was banned at the height of the pandemic, passenger numbers plummeted by about 95%,with TfW slashing services as demand fell. But in April, after travel restrictions lifted, TfW reported a rise in passengers to 20-30% of pre-pandemic levels, with footfall in stations up to 39% by 12 April. Up to 8% of trains overcrowded due to hot weather during pandemic Scientists have said the risk of transmission in a carriagedepends on how crowded a train is, and how far away you can stay away from people,external. Under Welsh government rules, public transport providers must take""all reasonable measures"" to ensure people stay two metres apart,external, or face being fined. Guidance urges them not to allow passengers to stand on public transport, to stop guards checking fares on trains, and to put on extra services and buses in areas of high demand. They are also urged - under reasonable measures - to stop people talking on mobile phones, reading newspapers, and to not allow passengers to eat or drink, while only allowing people to travel on booked seats. Passenger numbers on trains have increased since the non-essential travel ban was lifted TfW previously said keeping people apart as demand increased would be ""challenging"", but social distancing was a priority and safety measures would continue. Leyton Powell, TfW's safety and sustainability director, said the company was following government guidance. ""At times, such as during good weather, certain coastal services become busier, we understand our customer needs, monitor our capacity and where possible arrange additional services and road transport,"" he added. ""Queuing systems are in place at busy stations to protect customers and our staff and to enable social distancing, and we're actively promoting our capacity checker tool so that customers can plan ahead, not just for their initial journey but for that important trip home too."" He said the new intercity train, which is due to depart from Holyhead to Cardiff on Monday morning, would help increase capacity. ""We've also announced that we'll be adding an extra 30 of these carriages to our intercity route between Swansea and Manchester next year.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have announced the birth of their second child, a baby girl. Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday morning in a hospital in Santa Barbara, California. Both mother and child are healthy and well, the couple said in a statement. Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been informed and are delighted with the news."" Prince Harry and Meghan said they named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, the statement said. Royal Family tree and line of succession Profile: Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex Lilibet was born at 11:40am local time, weighed 7 lbs 11oz and is now ""settling in at home"". She is the Queen's 11th great-grandchild and is eighth in line to the throne. It means Prince Andrew, who was born as second in line in 1960, moves down to ninth place. In a message of thanks on the couple's Archewell website, they said: ""On June 4, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. ""She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe. ""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family."" The message adds that anyone wishing to send gifts is asked to ""support or learn more about"" organisations working for women and girls. They have not released any photos of their daughter. The Prince of Wales, Prince Harry's father, and the Duchess of Cornwalltweeted,external: ""Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie on the arrival of baby Lilibet Diana. Wishing them all well at this special time."" And the Duke of Duchess and Cambridge said: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson sent his ""many congratulations"" to the couple and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the ""wonderful news"". Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, met on a blind date and married in May 2018 in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. They welcomed their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, a year later. Meghan's friend, Misan Harriman, who took black-and-white photographs of the couple for their pregnancy announcement, tweeted his congratulations: ""Lilibet has arrived! Congratulations to my brave friend and her lovely family!"" The couple, pictured here with their son Archie, announced on Valentine's Day in February they were expecting their second child Prince Harry has publicly reflected on his approach to parenthood recently, sayinghe wanted to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering""of his upbringing with his own children. He and Meghan quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020. Speaking last month, the duke said moving to the US had not been part of the plan, but he felt he had to put his family and mental health first. As a result of the move, Lilibet is the most senior royal in the current line of succession to be born overseas and she would be eligible to become president of the United States. But like her older brother Archie, who was not entitled to a royal title when he was born, Lilibet would not be allowed to be a princess nor an HRH until the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, under rules set down more than 100 years ago. The Queen, pictured here with her grandparents in 1932, was called Lilibet by her grandfather King George V Lilibet - the Queen's family nickname - was coined when then-Princess Elizabeth was just a toddler and couldn't pronounce her name properly. Her grandfather, King George V, would affectionately call her Lilibet, imitating her own attempts to say her name. It soon stuck and she became Lilibet to her family from then on. The Queen's late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, also called her by the nickname, and wrote to his mother-in-law after their wedding: ""Lilibet is the only 'thing' in the world which is absolutely real to me."" Baby Lili's middle name, Diana, is in tribute to Prince Harry's later mother Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Lili's cousin, Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince William and Catherine, also has Diana as one of her middle names, as well as Elizabeth. Duncan Larcombe, former royal editor at the Sun, said he thought the name was ""the most royal name you could give"". ""There's no doubt that the choice of name for Harry and Meghan's first daughter is the first significant - possibly the only - olive branch that the Sussexes as a couple have offered to the British Royal Family since... they walked away from the family,"" he told the BBC. In November, Meghanrevealed she had a miscarriageseveral months earlier, writing about her ""almost unbearable grief"" in a deeply personal article for the New York Times. In the piece, she said ""despite the staggering commonality of [miscarriages], the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame"" and went on to commend those who ""bravely shared their stories"", saying: ""When one person speaks truth, it gives license for all of us to do the same.""

"England have won six games in a row since losing to Belgium in the Nations League in November 2020 Euro 2020 on the BBC Dates:Friday 11 June-Sunday 11 July.Host cities:London, Rome, Munich, Baku, St Petersburg, Budapest, Seville, Bucharest, Amsterdam, Glasgow, Copenhagen.Coverage:Live on BBC TV, BBC Radio 5 Live, iPlayer and BBC Sport website.Click here for more details England concluded their preparations for the Euros with victory over Romania in a friendly at the Riverside Stadium. Manager Gareth Southgate once again selected an experimental starting line-up which included three players - Ben Godfrey, Ben White and James Ward-Prowse - who were not named in his 26-man squad for Euro 2020. There was a mixed reaction to England's players continuing to take the knee before kick-off, loud jeering being matched by applause as Southgate insisted they will continue to take this public stand against racial injustice. England posed the greater attacking threat, with both Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jadon Sancho hitting the woodwork in the first half, before Marcus Rashford put them ahead from the penalty spot in the 68th minute after Jack Grealish, inevitably, was fouled by Tiberiu Capusa. It was the perfect way to mark Rashford being given the captain's armband, making him youngest black player to lead England at 23 years and 218 days. West Bromwich Albion keeper Sam Johnstone won his first England cap and gave a very sound performance, the highlight of which was a magnificent reaction save from Andre Ivan. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson gave Southgate a lift when he appeared at half-time for his first action since 20 February - although he did not cover himself in glory when he saw his late penalty saved by keeper Florin Nita after Calvert-Lewin was fouled by Vlad Chiriches.

England's opening opponents Croatia beaten by Belgium Grealish continues to make an eloquent case for inclusion in England's starting line-up when they launch their Euros campaign against Croatia at Wembley in seven days. In a patchy England display, Grealish was once again the brightest attacking spark, creating as well as drawing fouls in dangerous positions throughout. And it was on one trademark raid into the area that he drew the foul that delivered England their match-winning penalty, giving Southgate and his players the confidence of a second successive victory in this friendly double header on Teesside after Wednesday'swin against Austria. England will have a series of big hitters, led by captain Harry Kane, back against a wily Croatia side, but Grealish has certainly given Southgate plenty of food for thought in these two games - he has the ""X Factor"" that can make an impact on big games and switch the emphasis in major tournaments. Jack Grealish was making his seventh appearance for England Southgate must now decide whether this is an impact best made from the start or from the bench, with the likes of Manchester City's Phil Foden and Chelsea's Champions League winner Mason Mount to also factor into the equation. Euro 2020: Not reaching the semis a failure - Southgate How to follow Euro 2020 across the BBC Everything you need to know about Euro 2020 Southgate was keen to see Henderson get minutes on the pitch after being absent for so long following groin surgery, especially after he withdrew from the Austria game reporting some discomfort. It was no surprise to see Henderson introduced at the start of the second half for Leeds United's Kalvin Phillips. Henderson looked energetic enough, although the sedate pace of this friendly will be a far cry from the heat of competitive battle against Croatia when the Euros get under way. England's Euro 2020 Group D fixtures (all at Wembley, all times BST) Sunday, 13 June Croatia 14:00 Friday, 18 June Scotland 20:00 Tuesday, 22 June Czech Republic 20:00 He got himself involved in the action late on when he appeared to pull rank on Calvert-Lewin to take England's second penalty after the Everton striker had been fouled. Calvert-Lewin has already scored convincingly from the spot for England, in their win over the Republic Of Ireland at Wembley in November, but Henderson decided the responsibility was his - a poor decision as his spot-kick was unconvincing and at a comfortable height for Nita to save. It had no impact on the final outcome and of more significance to Southgate will be how Henderson has come through his long-awaited return to action. Even if Henderson reports no ill-effects, it would still represent a major gamble by Southgate to start him given his lack of competitive action. Allow Twitter content?

"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

"Children could die as a result of UK cuts to the overseas aid budget, a senior Conservative backbencher says. The prime minister is facing a possible Commons defeat after cutting spending of national income on international development from 0.7% to 0.5%. David Davis - among more than 30 Tories against the move - said some UK-backed schemes have already been cancelled and ""morally, this is a devastating thing"". The government's supporters say the cut is temporary, necessary and popular. Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Foreign aid: What is it used for? Kuenssberg: Numbers look tricky for government in aid vote The Conservative Party committed to spending 0.7% in its manifesto for the 2019 general election - but ministers say it is hard to justify given record levels of peacetime borrowing during the pandemic. The cut amounts to almost Â£4bn, but the government said it will still spend more than Â£10bn on foreign aid in 2021. Speaking at the start of a week in which the UK hosts the G7 summit in Cornwall, Mr Davis said: ""Historically, I am a critic of aid spending but doing it this way is really so harmful."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme if the government were to offer a compromise of a short time frame for their cut to foreign aid spending, ""it helps"". But he said ""if you're a small child and suddenly you get dirty water, you get an infection from it and you die, temporary doesn't mean much"". Mr Davis added: ""If you're going to kill people with this, which I think is going to be the outcome in many areas, we need to reverse those immediately"". Lee Margaret Webster from charity Action Aid told the BBC the cuts had forced a project tackling violence against women and girls in Rwanda to close. This included shutting down seven shelters providing sanctuary for girls escaping domestic violence, she said. The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Former Prime Minister Theresa May isone of the other Tory rebelshoping to achieve a U-turn with an amendment to the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) Bill - a planned new law to set up a new agency designed to come up with innovative policy. It would oblige the agency to make up any shortfall in aid spending if the government were to miss the 0.7% target. The bill is due to be scrutinised in the Commons on Monday afternoon - but it will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether the rebels' amendment should be put to a vote. BBC politics correspondent Iain Watson says the government is confident the Speaker will rule that the amendment is not sufficiently connected to the bill and therefore will not be debated. However, he says the Conservative rebels believe Sir Lindsay has not yet made up his mind. Voting on the bill will begin no later than 21:00 BST. It is not certain that the Speaker of the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle will allow a vote to go ahead later, but if he does, the numbers look very tricky for the government. First, plenty of backbenchers, and also privately some in the government, think that cutting aid right now is simply the wrong thing to do as a matter of principle. Next, the commitment to stick with spending 0.7% of GDP was in the Tory manifesto, and MPs don't like having to explain why promises have been broken. Thirdly, the cast list of those arguing to keep the commitment is full of well known Conservatives, including former prime ministers and cabinet ministers, who know how to get headlines, and how to organise. There are dozens of former ministers on the backbenches, who may not agree on everything but can agree on this, and are not exactly Mr Johnson's biggest fans. Lastly, the timing of this vote is awkward indeed. Mr Johnson is about to play host to the leaders of the free world at the G7. Does starting that week being beaten by his own backbenchers for reneging on a promise to the world's poorest sound tempting? Read more from Laura here. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown also criticised the cuts, telling BBC Breakfast it was ""a life and death issue"" and made ""no economic or moral sense"". Writing in the Guardian,,externalformer International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, who is leading the rebellion, said the UK is the only member of the G7 group of advanced economies cutting aid this year - and that ""contributing our fair share of aid is essential for a successful G7 summit"" this week. The aid reduction has meant millions of pounds less is being spent on supporting girls' education, reproductive health, clean water, HIV/AIDS, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and Syria, and hundreds of other projects. This video can not be played Sir Bob Geldof: ''We don't take the piece of bread from that child's mouth in Yemen'' Dozens of charities said there was ""no justifiable economic need"" for them ina letter to Mr Johnson over the weekend, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welbycalled the cuts ""indefensible"" on Twitter,,external. Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said the government would return to spending 0.7% levels ""when the fiscal situation allows"". She said the UK was a big aid donor but added: ""We have a duty to ensure we protect our citizens here as well as those in the rest of the world."" A senior government source told BBC political correspondent Chris Mason that if the amendment were to go through, it would be the equivalent of putting up income tax by a penny for every pound earned. And ex-Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued the UK shouldn't ""end up going into deeper debt in order to finance other countries"". Writing in the Telegraph,,externalshe said the UK should instead help poorer countries ""trade their way out of poverty"". ""If more and more aid was the solution, large parts of Africa would have escaped all poverty decades ago,"" she added.
