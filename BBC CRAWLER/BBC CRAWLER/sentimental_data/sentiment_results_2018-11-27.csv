1:0 with a goal in Fergie time 

love it Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys Manchester United Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho tells BT Sport:""It is a very difficult group and to qualify with a game to spare is good. The performance had a lot of good things and a lot of disappointing things too. ""We lost too many chances, crucial ones in crucial moments. This is the kind of game if you score in the first minute you normally go for a different performance. You could pay with a draw and with a defeat too. David de Gea only had one save but it looks a phenomenal save, a save that best goalkeeper in the world does and gives his team the possibility to win the match. ""We had more than one chance, we had a lot of half chances. It is not about blaming one player who missed a chance at the beginning of the game. ""Goals win games. I am happy with Marcus Rashford's intensity, the way we started and the intention we showed but then it is not easy to cope with the frustration and result that does not suit us. ""The most important thing is to qualify and for some of my lovers, and those that like stats, I am 14 seasons in the Champions League and 14 times my teams have qualified through to the group stages. The season I was not in the Champions League, I won the Europa League."" Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys Gary FlintoffBBC Radio 5 live reporter at Old Trafford Jose Mourinho has been speaking in his post-match press conference. âRelief. We didnât play to be in trouble until the last minute. I was
frustrated we couldnât score. My players were very tired at the end. Thatâs
what I want. Without David de Geaâs save, no winning goal. We qualified. We did it. âHe is the best goalkeeper in the world. If our ambitions
are to have the best in the world, we have to keep him. ""Realistically to be in the last 16 is an achievement,
not a big one or a fantastic one, but an achievement. There are better teams
than us. Teams with more quality and realistic ambitions. When a team arrives
in the quarter-finals, anything can happen.â Text 81111 (UK only). Pathetic behaviour from Mourinho yet again. I can't think of a manager who I'd rather play under less, no wonder this united team are massive underachievers. Tom, London Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys Manchester United Manchester United defender Phil Jones tells BT Sport:""It was tough we did well in the first half and could have been 3-0, 4-0 up. We are thankful to David de Gea for pulling off a wonderful save. it was not pretty but we got it done. ""I am happy to play, it is frustrating when you are not, but I am ready and can prove I am good enough."" Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys Allow Twitter content?

The spirit was good. We played positive and that was most important. ""For me it was not handball, I controlled the ball, if it touched my hand it was not on purpose. ""It's good for confidence to qualify. Next is Southampton and we have to be ready."" Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys Looking at the replay of Marouane Fellaini's winner, the ball did hit is hand but I don't think it was deliberate. Lyon 2-2 Man City Manchester City Manchester City defender Kyle Walker, speaking to BT Sport:""They gave us a good game at the Etihad so we knew it would be a tough game. They have good players in good areas and quick players but we got a good draw. ""That shows the character and belief in the dressing room. Important players come good at the right time. ""Lyon are technically good and quick and strong, that's why they hurt us at the Etihad and that's why we had point to prove."" On Aymeric Laporte:""He's done well. We practise set plays and he is a key figure in them. He pops up in the right places, which shows he is listening to the coaches and is working hard."" On Champions League:""There are still things we have to work on, it is completely different to Premier League. Still things we need to switch on to. But we're through and hopefully we can get a good draw."" Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys A Marouane Fellaini goal in injury time makes you do allsorts... Hoffenheim 2-3 Shakhtar Donetsk What a finish.

He applauds those in the Stretford End before disappearing into the changing rooms. Man Utd 1-0 Young Boys Simon StoneBBC Sport at Old Trafford Jose Mourinho's reaction to that Marouane Fellaini goal was priceless. He turned round, saw the water bottles behind him, pick the entire holder up and threw it into the ground. He once got a touchline ban for kicking a bottle, not sure if there is a punishment for that. That is how much this victory meant. United are into the last 16 with a game to spare.

"The remains of an electrical compartment recovered from the fridge freezer from flat 16 The fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower probably started due to overheated wiring in a fridge-freezer, according to one expert. John Glover told the inquiry into the blaze that a connector in a Hotpoint FF175BP in flat 16 of the block had a ""poor crimp connection"". That meant the wires were not gripped as tightly as they should be and the connector overheated, he said. A total of 72 people died as the result of the west London fire in June 2017. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us at the inquiry The public inquiry was shown a picture of the connector, which had been recovered from a small electrical compartment at the bottom of the fridge freezer. The inquiry was told that investigators also found three inches of damaged wire in one of the bedrooms of the flat. Areport by Mr Glover,external- a principal engineer at investigations firm Failure Electrical - said he studied CT scans of the connector and found spaces ""indicating the crimp was not nice and tight"". He added:  ""A probable cause of the fire is a poor crimp connection. ""The overheating connector in my opinion was the first event that started burning the insulation on the wires that led to a short circuit. ""The overheating of the crimp starts the fire. It overheats, it glows, it ignites."" LISTEN: BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast - how the fire likely can be traced to a fridge A week after the fire,the Metropolitan Police said it believed it had started in a fridge-freezer. The manufacturer, Whirlpool, and the government carried out investigations into the model, but in May this year they saidthere were no safety issues or a need to recall the product. A statement from Whirlpool said: ""We would like to reassure owners of these products that they are safe and they can continue to use them as normal. ""Two separate investigations have been carried out into this model... both investigations independently found no evidence of any fault with this model and confirmed that it fully complied with all safety requirements. ""We are committed to assisting the Grenfell Tower Inquiry in any way we can as it continues to investigate all the potential origins and causes of the fire and how it spread.""

"Carbon emissions have not yet peaked in many countries the report says Global efforts to tackle climate change are way off track says the UN, as it details the first rise in CO2 emissions in four years. Theemissions gap report,externalsays that economic growth is responsible for a rise in 2017 while national efforts to cut carbon have faltered. To meet the goals of the Paris climate pact, the study says it's crucial that global emissions peak by 2020. But the analysis says that this is now not likely even by 2030. The report comes days before a major UN climate conference starting in Poland from 2-14 December. UK summers could be over 5C warmer by 2070 Dire warning on US climate change impacts Attenborough takes seat at climate talks For the last nine years,UN Environment,externalhave produced an assessment of the latest scientific studies on current and future emissions of greenhouse gases. It highlights the difference between the level of greenhouse gas emissions that the world can sustain to keep temperatures within safe limits, with the levels that are likely based on the promises and actions taken by countries. This year's report records the largest gap yet between where we are and where we need to be. Between 2014 and 2016, global emissions of CO2 from industry and the production of energy were essentially stable while the global economy grew modestly - but in 2017 these emissions went up by 1.2% pushed along by higher GDP. While renewable energy sources are booming in countries like India, carbon emissions haven't yet peaked While the rise might seem small, it needs to be seen in context of efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C, as recently outlined in a keyIPCC report. According to the UN, to keep the world below that target, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would have to be 55% lower than today. ""There is still a tremendous gap between words and deeds, between the targets agreed by governments worldwide to stabilise our climate and the measures to achieve these goals,"" said Dr Gunnar Luderer, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and one of the authors of the study. The scientists say that to tackle the gap, nations must raise their ambition five fold to meet the 1.5C goal. Right now, the world is heading for a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century the report says. One key aspect of the study is about the peaking of global greenhouse emissions. The report says that peaking of emissions in 2020 is ""crucial for achieving the temperature targets in the Paris agreement,"" but the scale of the current efforts is insufficient. The study says that by 2030, around 57 countries representing about 60% of global emissions will have peaked. Nowhere near where the world needs to be. In some ways yes. The study says that countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU (including the UK), South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the US, are falling short of achieving their nationally determined contributions for 2030. The burning and clearing of forests in Asia contributes hugely to emissions Three countries, Brazil, China and Japan are currently on track, while three others, India, Russia and Turkey are set to beat their targets. The authors believe that some of these achievements may be down to setting relatively low targets for their national plans. Undoubtedly, yes. The UN is placing great hopes in what it terms ""non-state actors"", meaning local, city and regional governments, businesses and higher education institutions can have major impacts on the future gap. They estimate that, right now, more than 7,000 cities from 133 countries and 6,000 companies with at least $36 trillion in revenue have pledged to take climate action. But the authors believe this is just scratching the surface. With over 500,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, there are many more that can take steps that cumulatively would have a significant impact on the gap. The study says that there is the potential to cut emissions from this sector by 19 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year by 2030 - that's enough to keep the world on a 2 degree path. The report also suggests that government tax plans could be hugely important in tackling emissions. It says that carbon taxes or carbon trading systems cover only 15% of the global carbon output, which could rise to 20% if China implements its planned market. But the report says that half of the emissions from fossil fuels are not taxed at all and only 10% are priced at a level consistent with keeping warming to 2C. Subsidies for fossil fuels like coal will have to be phased out to meet climate targets ""When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,"" said Jian Liu, UN Environment's chief scientist. ""If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030. Setting the right carbon price is also essential. At $70 per tonne of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40% are possible in some countries."" This report is aimed at informing delegates to next week's key climate conference in Katowice, Poland. Negotiators will be trying to finish the rules on how to implement the rule book of the Paris agreement - but the report's authors hope it can push countries to greater levels of ambition. ""Germany and Europe could demonstrate leadership in this area by pledging complete greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050 and a clear strengthening of the emission reduction targets for 2030,"" said Dr Gunnar Luderer.

"This video can not be played Paul Lister, Primark's head of ethical trade, is asked to justify its low prices by Mary Creagh MP Big-name retailers have defended selling clothes for Â£5 or less, saying their ability to sell clothes so cheaply is down to business models. MPs investigating the impact ofso-called ""fast fashion""asked the firms how they could justify such low prices. Primark's spokesman Paul Lister said the firm spent nothing on advertising and had tight profit margins. Representatives from brands including Boohoo, Misguided, Asos, Burberry and Marks & Spencer also gave evidence. Can the fashion industry become more sustainable? Where the clothes you throw away end up Are we buying too many clothes? The Commons environmental audit committee (EAC) is examining the impact of clothes production, especially those items produced cheaply and quickly in response to trends - known as ""fast fashion"". This video can not be played We asked shoppers in London what their priorities are for when shopping for clothes Labour MP Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, asked Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability, Paul Lister: ""How can you justify selling T-shirts in your stores for as little as Â£2 or Â£3, and how can you be making a profit on those?"" He replied: ""Primark has never done any significant advertising at all, and that can save us in any year Â£100m to Â£150m, compared to some of our larger rivals. That goes straight into price. That keeps our pricing low."" ""It's our business model that takes us to a Â£2 T-shirt."" On waste, Mr Lister said Primark had very little unused stock and was planning to launch a take-back scheme for consumers next year, where old clothes can be returned and used again by overseas charities. Ms Creagh suggested that by making garments so cheaply, they were being devalued. But Mr Lister insisted: ""Every item that we make, we're looking at durabilityâ¦ we are proud of the quality and durability of our garments, they're not built to throw away."" The term describes our high rate of fashion consumption fuelled by the availability of new and cheap clothing. Producing clothes requires climate-changing emissions. Global textile production produces 1.2bn tonnes of carbon emissions a year - more than international flights and maritime shipping. Last month, MPs on the EAC concluded that the fast fashion industry was amajor source of the greenhouse gasesthat are overheating the planet. MPs believe that the throwaway nature of fashion is also fuelling fast turnarounds among suppliers, which may result in poor working conditions. Elsewhere, Carol Kane, joint CEO of online fashion house Boohoo, was asked how the company could sell dresses for as little as Â£5 when the minimum wage was Â£7.83. She said this only applied to a small number of dresses intentionally sold at a loss, to drive more traffic to the site. Ms Kane, asked if consumers were now too accustomed to cheap, disposable clothes, said: ""I believe this all comes back to consumer demand. I've been in the industry for 32 years, and in that time I've seen prices decline."" Speaking on the same issue, Jamie Beck, from the Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, said: ""These garments aren't designed to be a disposable item, to be bought for [just] a holiday. They're designed to be long-lasting."" Burberry has been criticised for destroying stock During the hearing, high-end fashion brand Burberry also defended criticism from MPs for dumping clothes. Earlier this year, the firm was strongly criticised for burning Â£30m ($40m) of stock.It admitted destroying the unsold clothes, accessories and perfumeinstead of selling them off cheaply, in order to protect the brand's exclusivity and value. Leanne Wood, Burberry's chief of corporate affairs, told MPs the firm was ""committed"" to stopping the activity, but added: ""It is an industry practice. We're the only luxury business that's reported it in their accountsâ¦ but it is something that happens in the industry."" Boohoo, Misguided and Asos were also quizzed on relationships with suppliers accused of exploiting workers in Britain. Paul Smith, head of product quality and supply at Misguided, said the firm had cut the number of businesses it worked with in Leicester - where many of the factories are based - from 35 to just 20 due to concerns about pay and conditions at some sites there. Pretty Little Thing is one of Boohoo's brands After the hearing, Ms Creagh said: ""Evidence we heard today justifies our concerns that the current system allows fashion retailers to mark their own homework when it comes to workers' rights, fair pay and sustainability. ""Marks and Spencer are supposed to be a leading light in corporate responsibility, but even they pulled out of a scheme seeking to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining. ""Boohoo did not convince us that it had a grip on the potential illegal underpayment of their Leicester-based workers."" She added that it was ""shocking"" to learn during the hearing that Misguided staff who went to check on conditions at a factory were allegedly assaulted by its owners, adding that it ""begs the question - what on Earth was going on inside?"".

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent?

"The remains of an electrical compartment recovered from the fridge freezer from flat 16 The fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower probably started due to overheated wiring in a fridge-freezer, according to one expert. John Glover told the inquiry into the blaze that a connector in a Hotpoint FF175BP in flat 16 of the block had a ""poor crimp connection"". That meant the wires were not gripped as tightly as they should be and the connector overheated, he said. A total of 72 people died as the result of the west London fire in June 2017. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us at the inquiry The public inquiry was shown a picture of the connector, which had been recovered from a small electrical compartment at the bottom of the fridge freezer. The inquiry was told that investigators also found three inches of damaged wire in one of the bedrooms of the flat. Areport by Mr Glover,external- a principal engineer at investigations firm Failure Electrical - said he studied CT scans of the connector and found spaces ""indicating the crimp was not nice and tight"". He added:  ""A probable cause of the fire is a poor crimp connection. ""The overheating connector in my opinion was the first event that started burning the insulation on the wires that led to a short circuit. ""The overheating of the crimp starts the fire. It overheats, it glows, it ignites."" LISTEN: BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast - how the fire likely can be traced to a fridge A week after the fire,the Metropolitan Police said it believed it had started in a fridge-freezer. The manufacturer, Whirlpool, and the government carried out investigations into the model, but in May this year they saidthere were no safety issues or a need to recall the product. A statement from Whirlpool said: ""We would like to reassure owners of these products that they are safe and they can continue to use them as normal. ""Two separate investigations have been carried out into this model... both investigations independently found no evidence of any fault with this model and confirmed that it fully complied with all safety requirements. ""We are committed to assisting the Grenfell Tower Inquiry in any way we can as it continues to investigate all the potential origins and causes of the fire and how it spread.""

"Kiara Moore's parents ran an outdoor pursuits business After fearing their car had been stolen with their two-year-old daughter inside, a couple then found it had rolled into a river, an inquest heard. Kiara Moore was found inside the vehicle in the River Teifi, Cardigan, in March and later pronounced dead. In recording a conclusion of misadventure, coroner Peter Brunton called it ""a catastrophic event"" to happen to any parents. Kiara had been left alone for two minutes as her mother went to get cash. In a statement issued after the inquest, Kiara's family said she was ""an amazing little girl who lived a life full of love and adventure"". The hearing at Aberystwyth Justice Centre was told the silver Mini was parked on a slipway outside the family business, Adventure Beyond, on 21 March. Kiara's mother Kim Rowlands put her daughter in the vehicle at about 15:30 GMT and went to get cash from inside the business. When she returned the car had ""vanished"" and police were called. But CCTV footage showed in the two minutes Ms Rowlands had left Kiara, the car had rolled into the river. A tribute from Kiara's nursery, Cylch Meithrin Drefach Felindre, was left on the riverside PCSO Caryl Griffiths, who dived into the water when the car was located in the river, broke down as she described to the inquest her efforts to get to Kiara. ""I dived head first into the river, the water was freezing cold and I could tell the current was really strong, pulling my head under the water. ""It was dirty and I could not see anything underwater."" Another police officer joined and helped Ms Griffiths smash a window. ""I immediately felt Kiara's body float out of the car into my arms,"" she said, adding she knew it was the toddler as she was wearing a pink jacket described by her parents. Kiara funeral to be 'bright and beautiful' Mum 'so sorry' for girl's river death Social media warning after child's death Ms Griffiths said after she got Kiara's body to shore, another officer began performing CPR. The girl was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she was pronounced dead. But the inquest was told Kiara would have drowned within 30 seconds of the car entering the water. In a statement Ms Rowlands described her daughter ""singing, shouting and laughing"" when she left her, but not strapped in and in a ""mischievous mood"". She said her only guess was she had ""a funny five minutes"". This video can not be played Tributes were paid to two-year-old Kiara Moore Her father, Jet Moore, said there had not been any issues with the Mini apart from ""normal wear and tear"" and Kiara knew not to play with the controls and ""had no interest"". The inquest was told the vehicle was found in third gear without the handbrake applied. Forensic vehicle examiner Aled Thomas said the handbrake was efficient and it would have taken ""some effort"" to release it. The cause of Kiara's death was given as immersion, with the coroner saying on the balance of probabilities, the handbrake had not been set when Kiara was left in the car. No charges were brought by Dyfed-Powys Police. Coastguard rescue teams and the RNLI searched the River Teifi The family's statement said: ""She left us all with a huge gap in our lives this year. ""Since she has been gone, not a day has passed where we have not spoken about her life with us, her brother, sisters and wider family. ""We had so many adventures with her in her short life.""

"Noel Conway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 A terminally ill man has lost a legal battle at the UK's highest court over his right to die. Noel Conway, 68, suffers from motor neurone disease and only has movement in his right hand, head and neck. The former lecturer from Shrewsburylost a challenge at the Court of Appeal in June after his case was rejected by the High Court. Supreme Court judges rejected his bid to appeal against the ruling, as his chance of success was ""not sufficient"". It means Mr Conway's case cannot proceed any further. In a joint statement the judges, Lady Hale, Lord Reed and Lord Kerr, said they had reached their decision ""not without some reluctance"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Mr Conway, who was too ill to attend the hearing in London, said it is ""barbaric"" that he must choose between ""unacceptable options"" to end his life. Mr Conway said his only option is to remove his ventilator, which he relies on 23-hours a day He said the ruling was ""extremely disappointing"", adding it is ""downright cruel"" to be refused a right to die. ""The only option I currently have is to remove my ventilator and effectively suffocate to death under sedation,"" he said. ""To me this is not acceptable."" Instead, he wants medical assistance to die when he has less than six months to live, while he still has the mental capacity to make a ""voluntary, clear, settled and informed"" choice. Fergus Walsh, medical correspondent, BBC News Noel Conway wants control of his death, and for a doctor to prescribe him a lethal dose of drugs to take once he is deemed to have less than six months to live. But section 2 of the 1961 Suicide Act makes this illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Mr Conway argued the current law is an unjustifiable interference with the right to respect for private life under the European Convention on Human Rights. The three Supreme Court judges said it was open to them to declare the current law was incompatible with the convention, and leave it to Parliament to decide what to do about it. But the judges will have taken into consideration the overwhelming vote by MPs three years ago, to reject proposals to allow assisted dying. Ultimately, while judges are there to interpret the law, it is only Parliament which can make them. ""No-one doubts that the issue is of transcendent public importance,"" the judges said. ""It touches us all... we all have to contemplate our own death."" WATCH: Should there be a right to die? Assisted dying: What is the law outside the UK? I face unbearable death, man tells court However, the court ruled Mr Conway's chances of a successful appeal were not sufficient ""to justify our giving him permission to pursue it, with all that that would entail for him, for his family, for those on all sides of this multi-faceted debate, for the general public and for this court"".

"Geoffrey Hutton has been found guilty of murdering debt collector Tina Cantello A man who stabbed a debt collector 30 times after she visited him to collect some money has been found guilty of murder. Geoffrey Hutton, 38, murdered Tina Cantello at his home in Langdon Hills, Essex, in June. Her partially-clothed body was found upstairs in a bedroom. After a two-week trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court, jurors took two hours to convict Hutton of killing the 49-year-old mother-of-four. He will be sentenced on Wednesday. The court heard how Ms Cantello, who worked for Provident Financial, visited Hutton at his home in Derby Close at about 17:30 BST on 8 June. She was reported missing by her family after she failed to return home. Tina Cantello worked as a debt collector making door-to-door visits Almost 24 hours later, police were called to the scene after a neighbour recognised Ms Cantello's car from the missing person's appeal. Hutton, who is deaf, emerged from the house covered in blood and officers went on to find the debt collector's ""largely naked"" body in a bedroom. She had suffered 30 stab wounds and 17 further injuries. During the trial, Hutton claimed an unknown intruder had carried out the killing but jurors heard his DNA was found on the body and murder weapon. They were also told he had bought drugs and went online to search for porn soon after the debt collector was killed. Ms Cantello's body was found at a property in Derby Close, Langdon Hills In a statement, Ms Cantello's family said they would ""refuse to allow Hutton's violent, vile and depraved actions to become her defining moment"". They said Hutton had ""deliberately sought to exploit his hearing impairment to deceive the court"" and ""piled insult onto injury"" by refusing to take responsibility for his actions. Branding him ""callous and calculated"", the statement added: ""No punishment would be commensurate with Hutton's grievous actions. His flagrant lack of remorse and atonement means he will never find forgiveness.""

"This video can not be played The bus ploughed into a Coventry branch of Sainsbury's in October 2015 A bus company has been fined Â£2.3m after ignoring warnings about an ""erratic"" driver who crashed into a supermarket, killing two people. Midland Red (South) Ltdadmitted health and safety breachesafter Kailash Chander, then aged 77, smashed into a Sainsbury's in Coventry in 2015. Mr Chanderhad been driving dangerouslywhen he mistook the accelerator for the brake, a fact finding trial concluded. The former mayor, now 80, was deemed unfit to stand trial due to dementia. Kailash Chander, a former mayor of Leamington Spa, was diagnosed with dementia and deemed unfit to plead or stand trial Midland Red (South) Ltd was sentenced alongside Mr Chander, who received a two-year medical supervision order, after a two-day hearing at Birmingham Crown Court. Mr Chander had been warned about his ""erratic"" driving by the company after four crashes in three years, the trial of facts found in September. The bus company, which is part of Stagecoach group, admitted allowing Mr Chander to work more than 70-hours a week. It also admitted allowing him to continue working despite warnings about his driving. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Judge Paul Farrer said ""the failings of the company were a significant cause"" of the crash. Warnings about Mr Chander were ""not enforced, and almost immediately ignored,"" he said. Phil Medlicott, managing director of Midland Red (South) Ltd said the company was ""deeply sorry"" and ""bears the weight of our responsibility for this tragedy"".

"The mothers claim single parents are being disproportionately hit by the system (picture illustrated by models) A single mum who relies on universal credit is challenging the government's benefits scheme for being ""irrational"". Danielle Johnson, 25, from West Yorkshire, said: ""I have never been this financially unstable before."" With three other single mums, she is claiming in the High Court that the benefit disproportionately affects single parents - most of them women. But an official in charge of it told the court it would cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" to re-design. Neil Couling, from the Department for Work and Pensions, said the system relied heavily on automation to process claims, and that less than 1% of claimants lost out as a result of the problem. The single mum who can't afford to work 'Universal Credit forced me into sex work' Watch: What's the benefit? Universal credit is a means-tested benefit, rolling six separate benefits into one payment. It has proved controversialalmost from its inception, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends, administrative problems and delays to the scheme's roll-out. Lawyers acting for the women will now argue there is a ""fundamental problem"" with universal credit, telling the court it discriminates against single parents and undermines government legislation - where the new benefit system was meant to encourage people into work. The DWP sets assessment periods for each person to look at how much they earn - from the 1st of the month to the end of the month, for example. The department then calculates how much benefit they are entitled to by how much they are paid in that time. Ms Johnson, like many employees, is paid on the last working day of the month and relies on universal credit to top up her income. If she is paid on 31st of one month and the 31st of the next, she is assessed as being paid her salary once a month and her universal credit is calculated correctly. But her lawyers argue that if she is paid on the 31st and the next month her payment day is a few days early - due to the last day falling on a weekend or Bank Holiday - her universal credit assessment shows she has been paid twice in a month. For example: In August, the last working day of the month was Friday 31st, so she would be paid as normal In September, the last working day of the month was Friday 28th, as the 30th fell on a Sunday Under the assessment period of universal credit, this would show her as being paid twice in a one month This assessment, essentially doubling what she earns in one month in the eyes of the DWP, would see her benefit entitlement reduced. The amount of universal credit a person gets gradually reduces as they earn more, but working parents are entitled to get what is called a ""work allowance"" of Â£198. This means the benefit you are entitled to is calculated on what you earn after that Â£198 - much like the personal tax allowance, where you don't have to pay tax on the first Â£11,850 you earn. The allowance is paid once in each universal credit assessment period. So, for Ms Johnson, she would get Â£198 for a month where her assessment shows she has been paid twice, but not get it the next month, as she has not been paid for work in that assessment period. Ms Johnson's lawyers, Leigh Day, said the system left her Â£500-a-year worse off and she struggled to budget in months when she received no benefit because of the way the system operated. Ms Johnson said: ""I'm doing my best working part-time to make ends meet so that I can look after my daughter. ""I have never been this financially unstable before, to the point of being unable to afford my rent and having to go into my overdraft when buying food. ""It is getting me into a vicious cycle of debt,"" she said. Claire Woods, another single mum involved in the case, said wildly fluctuating income from month to month has forced her to turn down a promotion, use a food bank and incur debts. In a previous job working for a county council, Ms Woods was paid at the end of every month which would clash with her universal credit assessment period. As a result, she lost money, could not meet her monthly outgoings and lived with the anxiety of a fluctuating income. When the council offered her a promotion, she knew the payment clash would remain, so did not take it up. ""I had to go to a food bank and I took out an advance that I am still paying back,"" she said. ""I took two jobs - as a PA and a waitress -  which I could do without the education I invested in, but which had paydays which don't clash with my assessment period. ""I invested Â£40,000 in higher education studies so that I could become an occupational therapist and it's great that I've got my degree but I have had to put my career hopes on hold because of universal credit."" Universal Credit- 'I've been left behind' Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you? Erin Barrett, who works as a healthcare assistant at a local hospital, said the problems with the benefit had led to spiralling debts. ""Life would be more manageable if I didn't work,"" she said. ""But I've always worked and so I want to work."" The fourth woman in the case, mum-of-one Katie Stewart, said she had to give up work due to the problems created by the system. Child Poverty Action Group's solicitor Carla Clarke, who is representing Ms Woods, Ms Barrett and Ms Stewart, said: ""Our clients have been left repeatedly without money for family essentials simply because of the date of their paydays. ""This is a fundamental defect in universal credit and an injustice to hard-working parents and their children that must be put right for our clients and everyone else affected."" A DWP spokesman said he could not comment on an ongoing legal case. But on universal credit, he said: ""Universal credit adjusts automatically to people's earnings so if someone's earnings are higher one month their universal credit payment decreases, but they may receive an increased universal credit amount the following month. ""People can see how much universal credit is due to be paid into their account online, and budget support is available to those who need it."" The two-day hearing is under way at the Royal Courts of Justice. Judges are not expected to make a judgment until later in the year. Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you?

The bus company, which is part of Stagecoach group, admitted allowing Mr Chander to work more than 70-hours a week. It also admitted allowing him to continue working despite warnings about his driving. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Judge Paul Farrer said ""the failings of the company were a significant cause"" of the crash.

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent? Half of tuition fees spent on teaching Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500 but higher for science?

" By Anisa Subedar Christopher Blair takes a sip of his coffee. Then he carefully focuses on one of the three screens in front of him. He’s in his home office, 45 minutes outside Portland, Maine, on the US East Coast. Stroking his thick beard, he looks at his bookmarks bar. He takes another sip before his coffee goes cold, inhales long and hard, then logs into the back end of one of his many websites. He begins by choosing a subject. Which “lucky” politician will be on the receiving end of his attention today? Bill Clinton? Hillary Clinton? One of the Obamas? Or maybe the subject of his story won’t be a person, but a policy. Gun control? Police brutality? Feminism? Anything that will push buttons. Christopher Blair Next, the details. Perhaps he’ll make up a controversial incident, a crime, a new law or a constitutional amendment. “Changing” the US constitution is particularly fun - he’s already written more than 30 fake amendments. (There are only 27 genuine ones.) Blair sits back in his chair and focuses intently on the screen. He leans forward, places his hands on the keyboard and starts the same way he does every time. Caps lock. BREAKING. Colon... BREAKING: Clinton Foundation Ship Seized at Port of Baltimore Carrying Drugs, Guns and Sex Slaves The words flow from the thoughts in his head. Unconnected to reality, he needs no research, and no notes. His fingers rhythmically tap the keys. Letters form into words, words into sentences and sentences into a blog of about 200 words. It doesn’t take long to write. Publish. Blair sits back in his chair and watches the likes and shares roll in. More than 3,000 miles (5,000km) away in a small town an hour east of the Belgian capital, Brussels, there’s another office in another family home. Outside, children play in the garden on a warm summer’s afternoon. Maarten Schenk navigates the steep set of stairs to his basement office. There’s an L-shaped desk in one corner - in another, a cooler is filled with bottles of peach-flavoured iced tea. His desk resembles Blair’s. On it, sit three computer monitors, with the machine hard drives tucked away neatly underneath. On one of the screens, he suddenly notices a lot of activity. The US is waking up, and spiking numbers on one page catch Schenk’s attention. He watches as one particular story is gathering momentum and is quickly being shared on Facebook and other social networks. Maarten Schenk Schenk logs into his own website and starts to type. His job is to tell the world that what he’s seeing online - the story that’s currently going viral about a Clinton Foundation ship, allegedly carrying drugs, guns and sex slaves - is a complete fabrication. It’s fake news. During the 2016 US presidential election, journalists began noticing a rash of viral made-up stories on Facebook. Bizarrely, many of the pages appeared to be posted by people from the Balkans and, afterBuzzFeed reportedon an unusual cluster of pages, reporters flocked to a small town called Veles in Macedonia. “The Americans loved our stories and we make money from them,” one fakertold the BBC. “Who cares if they are true or false?” The stories were, in the main, pitched to Donald Trump supporters. They included rumours about Hillary Clinton’s health problems and illegal dealings, stories about luminaries like Pope Francis lining up behind the Republican candidate, and other false news sure to either please or rile Trump’s supporters. It’s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences In December 2016, Hillary Clinton gave a speech in which she slammed “the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda” that had flooded social media over the past year. “It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences,” she said. It wasn’t immediately clear if she was referring to the election. At the time, some journalists interpreted her remarks as a reference to “pizzagate”, a conspiracy theory that grew to tremendous proportions online, and which promptedone man to storm into a Washington DC restaurant and fire an assault rifle. But regardless of Clinton’s meaning, the term was taken up by her victorious opponent and used in a completely different way a few weeks later. You are fake news At a fractious press conference President-elect Trump refused to take a question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta. “I’m not going to give you a question,” Trump said. “You are fake news.” Since then, “fake news” has been atopic of mainstream obsession and debate, although what is meant by the term varies hugely. Some insist on the original definition - fake stories of the type pumped out by those Macedonian teenagers. Others lump in politically motivated conspiracy theories - perhaps what Hillary Clinton was getting at. But people have also used “fake news” to describe honest mistakes, opinion, spin, propaganda or - like President Trump - news outlets or reporting that they simply don’t like. Not only that, but often stuck under the banner of “fake news” is satire or parody, which on the surface appears harmless, but could still fool people - with potentially negative consequences. Christopher Blair grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts, a city on the northern outskirts of Boston. His stepfather was a committed Democrat who once ran for the Massachusetts state senate. Christopher Blair (l) Blair spent more than two decades as a construction worker, a trade that took a toll on his body. So in the late 2000s, when the Great Recession hit and his industry slumped, he started looking for another source of income in liberal political blogging. He found he loved to write and had a real flair for making words come alive. He began a blog, the first of many. There was a liberation in being able to say what he wanted - arguing in favour of a range of positions on the left-hand side of American politics. But although it was fun and a few people started reading, blogging didn’t pay. And so he tried another tactic. He began to write fabricated, made up tales that looked like real news headlines. Streams of consciousness flowed from his head to the keyboard. When he saw the results online, the hundreds and thousands of likes and shares his posts were getting, he felt validated. Far more people were interested in fake news than Blair’s opinions or true stories. Not everyone was convinced. “You’re wasting all this time,” his wife told him. “It will never amount to anything.” But once his fake news started to get clicks, he was able to use Google’s advertising platform to convert page views into money. In 2014, he quit his day job completely. “Once writing became lucrative enough to not destroy my body in construction any more,” he says with a laugh, “that’s when it became time to stay at home with the kids and do this.” Blair created online identities using pseudonyms and aliases like Busta Troll and Flagg Eagleton. He took on the personas of patriotic Americans outraged at President Obama, liberals, feminists, the Black Lives Matter movement and more. He delighted in people who took the lies for the truth and shared the stories as if they came from real news websites. The success of the fakes led Blair to create a Facebook page called America’s Last Line of Defense. It was dedicated to fake news stories aimed at staunch Republicans and supporters of President Donald Trump. The headlines were sensational and sometimes even offensive. They had one aim - to provoke an emotional response that would get people to share them. • BREAKING: Torture Chamber in Bill Clinton’s Basement Described As A ‘Kill Room’ • BREAKING: New Orleans Saints Stranded on Runway in London After Pilot Takes A Knee and Walks Off • BREAKING: Obama, Soros and the Dems Ordered The Shutdown to Stage A Coup Blair himself describes the headlines he writes as “racist and bigoted”. But they went viral, and those shares turned into clicks, which turned into cash. Christopher Blair grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts, a city on the northern outskirts of Boston.

But they went viral - and those shares turned into clicks, which turned into cash. Back in Belgium, computer programmer Maarten Schenk had created software that could detect which stories were trending on Facebook. He called it Trendolizer. He would then write about them on his blog. But he struggled to find an audience. He was up against some of the world’s biggest media organisations. By the time he noticed a post was trending and wrote about it, big news sites had already covered it. But like Blair, Schenk discovered a niche when it came to fake news. For all of the people who who liked and shared fictional stories believing them to be real, there were others who appreciated someone who could identify those that were fake. Just because it’s trending, doesn’t mean it’s true When he discovered false stories and blogged about them, his site traffic went up. Not by an astonishing amount - he wasn’t making as much money as Blair - but enough for him to concentrate on debunking fake news. His blogLead Storiesbecame focused on the fakes, with the tagline: “Just because it’s trending, doesn’t mean it’s true”. Schenk also noticed patterns and repeated online behaviour. For example, on a weekly basis he saw fake stories about the death of Hillary Clinton. Every Saturday, he would read that the Democratic nominee had died - in a ballooning accident, boat crash or from a heart attack. Or hit on the head with a monster truck tyre. As he debunked the fake stories, Schenk began to collect information about fake news websites and the people behind them. His database allowed him to track the fakers across the internet, even as their websites and Facebook pages were taken down. He noticed broad themes. In addition to Hillary Clinton, voter fraud was a popular subject for fake stories, as were immigration and Islam. And given the Wild West nature of the fake news world, he increasingly found that more and more sites - including some of those from Macedonia - were stealing content, copy and pasting from other fake news sites. In fact, many were stealing content from just one source. That source was Christopher Blair. By early 2017, there was a lot of talk about the rise of Facebook-enabled fake viral news stories. But that didn’t mean that social media companies were doing anything about it. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg had famously scoffed at the suggestion that the fakes could sway voters. “Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook... influenced the election in any way - I think is a pretty crazy idea,”  he said just after the 2016 presidential election. But the frenetic political climate in America meant fake news writers like Blair were more successful than ever before. He hired other writers to churn out the fakes. And the money kept flowing in. “It was every day, all day,” he says. “We were getting results with what we were doing.” Christopher Blair and his dog But the good times couldn’t last forever. The political winds began to turn against him. Blair, a committed liberal Democrat, was being lumped in with a whole host of people accused of peddling lies to inflate support for President Trump. In Belgium, Maarten Schenk was increasingly drawn into the game of cat and mouse. Fake news writers were finding better, more creative and devious ways to capture an unwitting audience. But at the same time, Schenk was developing his systems, getting better at identifying the fake news writers and, crucially, getting his debunks in front of a wider audience. “I want to be just a Google search away,” when people think they’re looking at a false story, he says. Schenk estimates there’s about 200 dedicated fact-checking organisations worldwide - not nearly enough, he says. “As long as there is potential for profit, people will keep trying,” he says. “People will find new filters and then they [the fake news writers] will find ways to get around the filters.” In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey tore through Texas, killing dozens and causing billions of dollars of damage to Houston and the surrounding areas. Across the country in Maine, Blair sensed an opportunity to use his creative writing skills. He made up a story about a fictional imam in a fictional mosque in Texas. The imam, he wrote, refused to shelter non-Muslims during the storm. He found out, he got really upset... I immediately removed it and sent him a million apologies It would clearly whip up Blair’s fan base. And it was all untrue. But there was one problem. The photo that was used to accompany the story was of a real imam, the leader of a mosque in Canada. Ibrahim Hindy had never even visited Texas, but he was suddenlythe target of fake news. “He found out, he got really upset,” says Blair. “He was all over Twitter about how we were racists, xenophobes. The whole nine yards. I immediately removed it and sent him a million apologies.” It wasn’t the only time that Blair’s falsehoods had snared real people. Another of his websites carried a story about a US soldier who was a deserter. But he used the name and picture of a real person who had nothing to do with the story. Schenk noticed it going viral. And when he checked it out, he realised that a real person had been unfairly inserted into a fake story. He messaged Blair and got him to remove the story. But the two men continued messaging online. And that’s where Blair revealed his secret, his real reason for writing fake news. Blair liked it that Schenk had called him out. There was something that made him stand out from other fact checkers, simply by the fact that he had communicated with him. Other fact-checking websites, he says, write debunking blog posts, but never talk to him before they do. Schenk stood up to Blair, pointed out the mistake and got the fake story removed from the internet. And so Blair invited Schenk into a secret Facebook group with fans of his work. It was there that Schenk learnt the truth about Blair, and got an insight into what drove one fake news writer. “He basically explained his whole schtick,” says Schenk. “How they [fake news writers] work.” There were heavy hints in the disclaimers that Blair slapped all over his websites and Facebook pages. The Last Line of Defense has one that reads:  “We are here to provide you with information you can use to continue being as informed as a conservative feels comfortable with. Please don't use our page in conjunction with Google or the news, it will only serve to confuse you further.” Satire - not news, not opinion, and not propaganda - is how Blair describes his work. His aim is to trick conservative Americans into sharing false news, in the hope of showing what he calls their “stupidity”. “We’ve gone out of our way to market it as satire, to make sure that everybody knows that this isn’t real,” he says, pointing out that some of his pages have more prominent disclaimers than the world-famous satire site The Onion. Once his stories go viral, the Facebook comments burst forth. And that’s when Christopher Blair the fake news writer becomes Christopher Blair the crusading left-wing troll. “The mission with the trolling first and foremost is we pull them into the comments [section underneath each fake article],” he says. It's then that he starts on the offensive. The faker becomes the exposer, weeding out and reporting the most extreme users among his fans. “I can show you hundreds of profiles we’ve had taken down,” he says. He claims that he’s exposed Ku Klux Klan members and hardcore racists. “We’ve had people fired from their jobs,” he says. “We’ve exposed them to their families. Say what you want about me being a monster. I’m pretty proud.” Blair and his small army of writers and allies also have other ways of fighting their ideological opponents.  And one of his politically motivated stunts has become legendary in the internet world. “It was a mission that went on for months,” he says. The goal was to infiltrate conservative Facebook pages and take them over, by winning over the trust of their administrators to the point where they were given admin privileges themselves, which they then used to throw out the original owners. “There was an army of people involved,” he says, estimating that his group took control of 26 conservative Facebook pages. “The pictures [originally on the pages] were of Obama being lynched and depicting him as a Muslim. All those stupid hate posts that are on a typical conservative page. We just tore them up, threw them away. “We took their pages over and replaced everything with pictures of goats,” he says. “I called the army of trolls and they showed up. For days it was goats on top of goats.” Schenk knows the story well. “They called themselves the ‘goatherd’,” he says. The episode was more evidence of Blair’s real motivation - politically motivated pranksterism. As public awareness about fake viral stories grew, so did pressure on social media companies to do something about it. Mark Zuckerberg said his personal challenge for 2018 was to “fix” the social site, to combat hate and abuse, but also fake news. In April, 2018, he was called in front of Congress to answer questions about a host of issues, the fakers on his platform being one of them. As a result, in July, Facebookannounced algorithm changesdesigned to boost content from “friends, family and groups”. The company, realising it had an image problem, launched an ad campaign to reassure users that they would be protected from “spam, clickbait, fake news and data misuse”. Some Facebook pages were deleted, while other publishers found that their posts were not travelling as far or as fast as they once had done. I’m not some monster. I’m a liberal... the goal isn’t money For Blair, the money began to dry up. Largely because of Facebook’s changes, he says he now makes a fraction of what he did at the height of the fake news boom. But he insists money was never the motivator, and instead he claims to be a “leader of the resistance” against President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. “I’m not some monster. I’m a liberal,” he says. “The goal isn’t money.” “There hasn’t been any money in six months. [But] go look at my page, I’m still active, I’m still doing it. I’m still writing. “I still believe and I always will.” Blair and Schenk had swapped messages online, but they’d never actually spoken until recently, when I called them both at the same time andrecorded the conversation for BBC Trending. They hadn't needed much convincing, and were keen to talk to each other. But the conversation started awkwardly. Two men who were usually not short of words were suddenly reticent, unsure of what to say. Schenk began by saying that on one level, he admired Blair. “He’s very good at what he does,” he says. “His stories have always been quite easy to debunk because they mostly say, right at the end, it’s all fake - and also [it says the same] in the header of his sites.” But Schenk will still write about them if they go viral - the fact that something is presented as satire doesn’t stop him from debunking it. “I see my job as a fact checker. My job is not to give an opinion about it,” he says. What I do is an art form “Whether you agree with it or not, what I do is an art form,” Blair says. “The stuff that I write a lot of the time - I read it and I laugh at myself. It’s ridiculous.” Schenk points out that Blair’s posts often lead him to other fake news writers, ones who don’t use disclaimers and who are much more straightforwardly spreading lies. The Macedonian teenagers aren’t the only ones copying and pasting from Blair - other fake news writers around the world do the same. Because of this, Schenk says, “he’s a great way of finding actual fake news sites.” I’m not trying to shut you down And so it turns out that a conversation that could have been angry or combative is actually quite friendly. Even when Blair adamantly states he won’t stop writing fake stories. “I don’t know that [Maarten] wants to close me down. Maybe he does.” Then he speaks directly to his opposite number: “You’re welcome to try,” he chuckles. “I can most definitely assure you that I’m not trying to shut you down,” Schenk replies. As the conversation winds down, I ask Blair - this godfather of fake news - and the man who tracked him down, if they have any parting words. “Don’t ever stop doing what you’re doing,” Blair says. And, with a hint of respect in his voice, Schenk replies: “Likewise.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,3.492403e-05

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent?

"This video can not be played Former Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says negotiators should be sent back to Brussels Theresa May's Brexit deal is ""doomed"" and must be renegotiated, ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said. Sir Michael launched a scathing attack on the proposed EU agreement, saying it was the ""worst of all worlds"" and the PM's future was ""up to colleagues"". The prime minister is visiting Wales and Northern Ireland to argue her deal will bring certainty to business. DUP leader Arlene Foster told BBC News the trip was a ""waste of time"" as Parliament would not support her deal. Mrs Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives to support the government, said Mrs May had ""given up"" on trying to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Arlene Foster on the Brexit backstop: ""It's time to get rid of it and to try to find a better deal"" While people were ""fed up"" with the Brexit process dragging on, that was not a good enough reason ""to accept what's on the table"", she told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg.

Sir Michael's decision to come out against the deal is a blow to the prime minister, who is struggling to muster support in Parliament for it. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Democratic Unionists have said they will vote against the deal while many Tories have said publicly they are opposed. Mrs May has said Welsh farmers will enjoy a brighter future outside the Common Agricultural Policy Opponents of the deal say it will keep the UK too closely tied to EU rules and make it harder to strike future trade deals with other countries and minimise their value. US President Donald Trump has suggested the withdrawal agreement ""sounds like a great deal for the EU"" and might hamper a future trade deal with the UK but Mrs May said this was not the case.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""this is not a good deal and we need a better deal"", saying that Mr Trump's criticism of its repercussions for transatlantic relations ""could not simply be brushed off"". ""My fear is that this deal gives us the worst of all worlds,"" he said. ""No guarantee of smooth trade in the future and no ability to reduce the tariffs that we need to conclude trade deals with the rest of the world. ""So, unless the House of Commons can be persuaded somehow that those are possible then I think, yes, the deal is doomed."" Asked if Mrs May was also doomed, he replied ""that's up to my colleagues"", while stressing that a change of leader would not necessarily address the difficulties the UK now found itself in. When it was put to him that did not sound like an endorsement of Mrs May, he replied ""take it any way you want"". The prominent Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin said there was a lot of ""personal sympathy"" for Mrs May but her authority when it came to the Brexit agreement was ""collapsing"".

He told Today there was no ""Plan B"" and the agreement was a ""decent compromise"" which would provide a springboard to the next stage of negotiations on the two sides' future relationship. The prime minister is continuing to making the case for the agreement, which she says delivers on the 2016 referendum vote in key areas and is in the national interest. Responding to Mr Trump's comments, Downing Street has insisted the UK will be able to pursue an independent trade policy under the terms of the political declaration on future relations. During a visit to an agricultural show in Builth Wells, Powys, Mrs May said: ""As regards the United States, we have already been talking to them about the sort of agreement that we could have in the future. ""We have a working group set up and that is working very well, has met several times and is continuing to work with the US on this."" Under the proposed agreement, the UK would not be able to complete any trade deal with a country outside the EU until the end of the proposed transition period - currently scheduled to last until 31 December 2020. In reality, any bilateral agreement between the UK and the US is likely to take years to negotiate given its complexity, differing standards in areas such as agriculture, and the fact it would require ratification by the US Congress.

"Theresa May has denied claims from DUP leader Arlene Foster that she had ""given up"" on negotiations before agreeing the Brexit deal. Mrs Foster said the PM's trip to promote the deal to businesses in Wales and Northern Ireland was a ""waste of time"" as Parliament would not back it. Meanwhile, former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the BBC the deal was ""doomed"" and must be renegotiated. Mrs May insists it protects the ""vital interests"" of the whole of the UK.

"Companies looking for somewhere to store extra supplies of fresh food in the run-up to Brexit in March may be too late, the chief executive of the food and drink federation has told MPs. Ian Wright said that warehouses around the UK for frozen and chilled food are ""for all practical purposes booked out at the moment"". Space for other goods is available but in the wrong places, he added. He said some suppliers were being ""innovative"" to provide extra space. Speaking to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Mr Wright said that there was no bookable space remaining in the warehouses that can store frozen or chilled produce in the near future. ""We don't know if there are products in those places or people have booked the space to be careful or for production,"" he said. ""Some innovative providers are doing the Airbnb of warehousing which is very interesting, but for big and medium-sized businesses, that just won't work."" Brexit: Can firms stop stocks running low? My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Brexit: No deal brings risk of stockpiling, says watchdog Small businesses 'fed up' with Brexit turmoil Mr Wright said there was still availability for ambient goods - food that can be safely stored at room temperature in a sealed container - but not necessarily where it would be needed on companies' supply journeys. ""Those warehouses are not close to the correct infrastructure or supply chains. The issue is geographical as well as conceptual and is why the intersection around Rugby is such an enormous growth area."" This video can not be played Operations manager Jake Rattenbury took the BBC behind the scenes at a Cardiff warehouse where food is being stockpiled Mr Wright added that he was in favour of the Draft Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May because it was preferable to leaving the European Union without a deal. ""The political declaration is excellent, but it is a list of new year's resolutions,"" he said. ""We don't know if what we see now will remain intact. ""We like what we have now. No deal is infinitely worse than anything we could imagine, therefore the deal on the table is better than no deal, but is not as good as the status quo,"" he said. Mr Wright was appearing before the committee with Dan Mobley, corporate relations director of spirits producer Diageo, and Ian Rayson, director of corporate communications at food and drink company Nestle. Mr Rayson said his company was buying supplies in advance. ""We are stockbuilding some products to bring into the UK and stockbuilding in Europe products that we would send out there,"" he said. Mr Mobley said that his company would wait to see how the UK was going to leave the EU before making decisions on stock. ""If we are going to face a chaotic Brexit, that will pose problems for us and we will work out market by market if we need to increase shipments,"" he said. ""We've put in place planning so we can manage a no-deal without any disruption to customers. ""We do not supply perishable items but slow-moving consumer goods and we are also fortunate that almost everything we manufacture in the UK is shipped out of Grangemouth and not out of Dover."" He added that his company's main worry around Brexit was around the labour market and not the supply chain.

"Yang Guang is recovering from surgery, which took place on Saturday Edinburgh Zoo's male giant panda has had both testicles removed after tumours were discovered by keepers. Yang Guang is said to be ""recovering well"" from the surgery, which took place on Saturday. He had arrived at Edinburgh Zoo in 2011 with female Tian Tian as part of a conservation breeding programme, whichwas halted earlier this year. The zoo said the tumours had not been a factor in the failure of the pandas to produce a cub. Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the only giant pandas in the UK. After years of failed attempts to produce a cub, the panda breeding programme was suspended earlier this year. At the time, zoo officials said they wanted to make enhancements to the giant panda enclosure and take time to analyse the data before any future breeding attempts. Darren McGarry, head of living collections at the zoo, said it would discuss the next steps, including future breeding possibilities, with its partners in China over coming weeks. He added: ""We are pleased Yang Guang is recovering well. ""Testicular tumours have previously been reported in giant pandas. The tumours we removed developed recently, so they have not been a factor in Yang Guang and Tian Tian not having had a cub."" Female panda Tian Tian arrived in Scotland, along with Yang Guang, from China in 2011 There was considerable diplomatic effort on the part of the Scottish and UK governments to bring the pandas to Edinburgh Zoo seven years ago. The zoo argued that they had suitable staff and could call on outside experts who would work together on panda breeding and conservation. The zoo had a financial arrangement with the Chinese authorities to keep Yang Guang and Tian Tian for 10 years at an annual fee of Â£600,000. As part of the deal, any cubs would remain in Edinburgh for two years before being sent back to China. In the first year after the arrival of the pandas, the zoo enjoyed a 50% increase in its visitor numbers. A report from Scottish Enterprise estimated they would generate almost Â£28m for the Edinburgh economy during their 10-year stay, with an additional Â£19m being spent in the wider Scottish economy.

"The inflatable Santa broke free of its moorings in Wisbech Drivers found themselves stuck in a lengthy ho-ho-hold up when a giant inflatable Santa landed on a busy road. The floating Father Christmas broke free of its moorings and drifted on to the Cromwell Road in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, blocking it in both directions at about 13:30 GMT. Taxi driver Muhammad Fareed captured the stricken Santa on camera as he waited in a queue of traffic. ""It was one of the more unusual reasons to be stuck in traffic,"" he said. A traffic alert by the AA said the road was ""partially blocked - and slow traffic due to a large inflatable Santa on B198 Cromwell Road both ways in Wisbech"". Mr Fareed, a father-of-three from Peterborough, said the giant Santa had broken free from the front garden of a house on Cromwell Road. De Niro talkin' and dining in Halifax Brian May the seal swallows plastic bag Anglo-Saxon 'lavish' burials unearthed ""I saw it wobble and then come down on to the road - it did raise a smile.""

"Five people racked up 8,655 calls to the Metropolitan Police in 2017 - costing Â£70,000 to answer. What did the top five repeat callers have in common? Mental health problems. A watchdog for police forces in England and Wales released the figure to show how police have become the ""default"" service to deal with mental health. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Service claims the broader mental health system is ""broken"". The Home Office said it was investing in mental health services and praised ""police leadership"" in the area. But the Police Federation welcomed the ""frank assessment"" from the Inspectorate and said the prime minister and home secretary ""should hang their heads in shame"". Police and paramedics in Scotland in pilot mental health project Mental health dominates armed police time in Northern Ireland Independent watchdog HMICFRS inspected the police response to mental health problems for the first time across all 43 forces in the two countries and the British Transport Police. Other figures in its report showed: In London, police receive a call about a mental health concern once every four minutes and send an officer to respond every 12 minutes Welsh forces estimated that each call they go out on for a mental health-related issue takes three hours on average to deal with In half of all mental health-related calls, the police, rather than the ambulance service transport people to a place of safety ZoÃ« Billingham, HM Inspector of Constabulary, said other services ""need to stop relying on the 24/7 availability of the police"". She added: ""This is letting down people with mental health problems, as well as placing an intolerable burden on police officers and staff. ""It is a national crisis which should not be allowed to continue; there needs to be a fundamental rethink and urgent action."" As part of the report, the HMICFRS spoke to groups of people with mental health problems who had been involved with the police. We have included three of their experiences - all participants are anonymous. ""I have had a lot of support from police. My baby died in foster care. I went off the rails. ""The police saw me sitting on the pavement crying hysterically. The officer asked me what was wrong and put his coat around me. ""He put me in the back of the car and said 'I am taking you to hospital to get some support'. ""He stayed with me and took me home and when I went into the treatment centre, the police officer sent me a card that said: 'Do well, this is your beginning'."" Forces have a number of programmes to try and improve their response to mental health-related incidents. The aim is to reduce the number of people detained under section 136 the Mental Health Act 1983 - where officers can remove a person to a place of safety if they are in immediate need of care or control. Of the 43 forces, 42 now have ""street triage"" teams - a programme that sees dedicated mental health professionals go out with police officers to give help when needed. Lincolnshire has gone as far as funding a fully equipped ambulance, staffed by a paramedic and a mental health nurse, that can be used for police and ambulance calls seven days a week. Others, like Humberside Police, have mental health practitioners from charities like Mind based in their control rooms to identify those who need help when they call. And some, like Cambridgeshire Constabulary and Essex Police, have integrated mental health teams in their force control rooms. But whilst Hertfordshire Constabulary told HMICFRS that its scheme had reduced the demand on partners and the number of people it detained under the Mental Health Act, the number of incidents involving people in mental health crisis continues to rise. ""This might indicate that people aren't receiving the primary care or community-based mental health care that might prevent them from reaching crisis point in the first place,"" said the report. ""I started carrying a knife around 'cos the voices were telling me to harm people and myself. What I wanted was to get sectioned. ""I went and told my probation officer. She sat me down and contacted the community mental health team. ""I sat down in front of the doctor and psychiatrist and do you know what they said to me? 'We can't give you what you want.' ""So basically, I have to go out there and do something before the crisis team can section me. ""I'm there carrying a knife around looking to do something to someone, or myself, and I have to do it before I can get into hospital. ""This was a year ago. I was scared for people, I am a dangerous man."" Inspector Billingham said: ""Police officers naturally want to respond and do their best to support vulnerable people when they ask for help. ""And we found that police officers respond to those with mental health problems with care and compassion. ""But we cannot expect the police to pick up the pieces of a broken mental health system. She added: ""Over-stretched and all-too-often overwhelmed police officers can't always respond appropriately, and people in mental health crisis don't always get the help they need."" ""I told the officer I had mental health problems. He said, 'where's your medication?' ""When he saw it he said, 'ah, my sister suffers with that'. ""His approach towards me changed. He arranged for me to be assessed. I was taken to hospital. I wasn't in handcuffs. ""He got me a cup of tea when we were waiting for the medical staff to assess me. ""He talked to me about his sister and how he had helped her. ""He told me about charities to get support. He understood the mental illness that I had."" A spokesman from the Home Office said the police had worked closely with the NHS to reduce the number of people held in police custody as a place of safety - down 95% since 2011/12. He also said the government was investing Â£2bn into mental health services, including mental health liaisons in accident and emergency departments and community crisis services. But the National Chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, said the HMICFRS report ""reflects the reality"" of what officers are experiencing daily and blamed the government austerity cutbacks. ""We are the service of last resort, the organisation which cannot refuse to go when we are called, the people who fill the 17:00-09:00 gap left by other agencies and that it is placing an intolerable burden on police officers,"" he said. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, added that the situation was ""unfair on both the patient and the police"", and forces ""should be no substitute for mental health provision"".

"Location data is being grabbed without users giving consent, consumer groups claim Google has been accused of flouting European data protection laws when it tracks users' locations. A coalition of seven consumer organisations is filing complaints with local data protection regulators over Google's tracking system. The complaints draw on research by one coalition member, which alleges people are forced to use the location system. Google said tracking was turned off by default and could be paused at any time by users. In a statement,the coalition said Google used ""deceptive practices"",externalto make people turn on its different tracking systems. Consent, it said, was not being freely given. In addition, it alleged, Google did not give ""straightforward information"" about what surrendering the data entailed. Location data could give deep insights into someone's lifestyle including their religious beliefs, political activity, health and sexual orientation, said the statement. ""These unfair practices leave consumers in the dark about the use of their personal data,"" said BEUC, speaking for the consumer groups. Organisations in the Netherlands, Poland, Greece, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the Czech Republic all plan to file complaints to their local regulators under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. The seven organisations are members of BEUC - an umbrella group that represents and lobbies for European consumer advocacy groups in Brussels. In response, Google said: ""Location history is turned off by default and you can edit, delete, or pause it at any time. ""If it's on, it helps improve services like predicted traffic on your commute,"" it added. Anyone who did pause tracking was told that Google might still, ""depending on your individual phone and app settings"", collect data about where people went, it said. ""We're constantly working to improve our controls and we'll be reading this report closely to see if there are things we can take on board,"" said Google.

"Kiara Moore's parents ran an outdoor pursuits business After fearing their car had been stolen with their two-year-old daughter inside, a couple then found it had rolled into a river, an inquest heard. Kiara Moore was found inside the vehicle in the River Teifi, Cardigan, in March and later pronounced dead. In recording a conclusion of misadventure, coroner Peter Brunton called it ""a catastrophic event"" to happen to any parents. Kiara had been left alone for two minutes as her mother went to get cash. In a statement issued after the inquest, Kiara's family said she was ""an amazing little girl who lived a life full of love and adventure"". The hearing at Aberystwyth Justice Centre was told the silver Mini was parked on a slipway outside the family business, Adventure Beyond, on 21 March. Kiara's mother Kim Rowlands put her daughter in the vehicle at about 15:30 GMT and went to get cash from inside the business. When she returned the car had ""vanished"" and police were called. But CCTV footage showed in the two minutes Ms Rowlands had left Kiara, the car had rolled into the river. A tribute from Kiara's nursery, Cylch Meithrin Drefach Felindre, was left on the riverside PCSO Caryl Griffiths, who dived into the water when the car was located in the river, broke down as she described to the inquest her efforts to get to Kiara. ""I dived head first into the river, the water was freezing cold and I could tell the current was really strong, pulling my head under the water. ""It was dirty and I could not see anything underwater."" Another police officer joined and helped Ms Griffiths smash a window. ""I immediately felt Kiara's body float out of the car into my arms,"" she said, adding she knew it was the toddler as she was wearing a pink jacket described by her parents. Kiara funeral to be 'bright and beautiful' Mum 'so sorry' for girl's river death Social media warning after child's death Ms Griffiths said after she got Kiara's body to shore, another officer began performing CPR. The girl was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she was pronounced dead. But the inquest was told Kiara would have drowned within 30 seconds of the car entering the water. In a statement Ms Rowlands described her daughter ""singing, shouting and laughing"" when she left her, but not strapped in and in a ""mischievous mood"". She said her only guess was she had ""a funny five minutes"". This video can not be played Tributes were paid to two-year-old Kiara Moore Her father, Jet Moore, said there had not been any issues with the Mini apart from ""normal wear and tear"" and Kiara knew not to play with the controls and ""had no interest"". The inquest was told the vehicle was found in third gear without the handbrake applied. Forensic vehicle examiner Aled Thomas said the handbrake was efficient and it would have taken ""some effort"" to release it. The cause of Kiara's death was given as immersion, with the coroner saying on the balance of probabilities, the handbrake had not been set when Kiara was left in the car. No charges were brought by Dyfed-Powys Police. Coastguard rescue teams and the RNLI searched the River Teifi The family's statement said: ""She left us all with a huge gap in our lives this year. ""Since she has been gone, not a day has passed where we have not spoken about her life with us, her brother, sisters and wider family. ""We had so many adventures with her in her short life.""

"One of the three men, Andriy Drach, was described as a Ukrainian security service employee Statements by three captured Ukrainians have been released by Russia's security service after Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats off the coast of Russian-annexed Crimea. One of the men, Volodymyr Lisovyi, said he was aware of the ""provocative nature"" of the Ukrainian action. Ukraine's navy commander said the men had been forced to lie under duress. Meanwhile, a Crimean court ordered that 12 of the 24 Ukrainians seized on Sunday be detained for 60 days. The court is expected to issue rulings for the remaining servicemen on Wednesday. Western nations have condemned Russia's use of force, four years after it seized Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula. The flare-up is the first outright clash between Ukraine and Russian forces for years, although pro-Russian separatists and Russian military ""volunteers"" have been fighting Ukraine's army in two eastern regions. Stakes are high in Ukraine-Russia sea clash Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Tensions escalated when Russia opened a bridge this year between Russia and Crimea over the Kerch Strait, which leads into the Sea of Azov. Ukraine has two big ports on the northern shore of the Azov sea, and a 2003 treaty allows both countries free access to its waters. Russia has accused the two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug of violating Russian territorial waters as they sailed through the Kerch Strait. But Ukraine says the incidents happened in areas that are free to shipping. On Monday night, Ukraine's parliament responded by backing President Petro Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law for a 30-day period from 26 November in 10 border regions. On Tuesday, President Poroshenko said there was a threat of ""full-scale war"" with Russia. ""The number of [Russian] tanks at bases located along our border has grown three times,"" he said. Five of the 10 regions border Russia while two are adjacent to Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed. The other three regions border the Black Sea or Sea of Azov close to Crimea. The Ukrainian navy has published photos of its ships that were damaged by Russian fire Since April 2014, Ukraine's army has been fighting pro-Russian separatists in two eastern regions of Ukraine bordering Russia, Luhansk and Donetsk. The move to martial law is unprecedented in Ukraine, and gives military authorities the right to ban protests and strikes. Mobilisation of civilians for military service is possible but not inevitable. Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter The Ukrainian sailors were captured by Russia on Sunday and at least three were wounded. Late on Monday night, the FSB security service released videos of three of the men: Andriy Drach said he was on the Nikopol gunboat with an order to sail from Odessa to Mariupol. ""We were warned by the border service of the Russian Federation that we were violating Russian law. They had repeatedly asked us to leave the territorial waters of the Russian Federation,"" he said Serhiy Tsybizov said he was also on the Nikopol Volodymyr Lisovyi said he was commander of a military unit and was part of a naval task force. ""I deliberately ignored requests via ultra-short-wave band,"" adding that there were small arms on board as well as machine-guns Volodymyr Lisovyi was one of three men who gave statements described as ""under duress"" by the head of Ukraine's navy The head of the Ukrainian navy, Ihor Voronchenko, told Ukrainian TV that the three men had given false statements under duress. ""I know those sailors from Nikopol. They have always been honest professionals in their jobs, and what they say now is not true,"" he said. The head of Ukraine's SBU security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, confirmed Russian reports that members of the service were on board the boats, but added that it was a ""routine counter-intelligence mission"" of a type that the Russian navy carried out regularly. Several countries have condemned Russia's actions on Monday, and the UN Security Council failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda, and instead discussed a Ukrainian proposal on the issue. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the seizure of Ukrainian ships was a ""dangerous escalation and a violation of international law"". President Donald Trump said: ""We do not like what's happening, either way we don't like what's happening and hopefully they'll get straight."" The UK condemned Russia's ""destabilising behaviour in the region and its ongoing violation of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty"". Taking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had ""deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation"", the Kremlin said. Mrs Merkel had ""stressed the need for de-escalation and dialogue"", her spokesman said. Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? Russia-Ukraine hostility explained.

"This video can not be played Trump: Brexit agreement ""great deal for EU"" Donald Trump has suggested Theresa May's Brexit agreement could threaten a US-UK trade deal. The US president told reporters the withdrawal agreement ""sounds like a great deal for the EU"" and meant the UK might not be able to trade with the US. No 10 insisted it is ""very clear"" the UK would be able to sign trade deals with countries around the world. Downing Street added that Mrs May is ready to defend her deal in a TV debate with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It has been reported the debate could take place on 9 December - two days before the Parliamentary vote on Mrs May's deal. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Mr Trump said: ""Right now if you look at the deal, [the UK] may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldn't be a good thing. I don't think they meant that."" Inside a US/UK trade deal Reality Check: The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit The UK-US trade relationship in five charts It would appear Mr Trump was suggesting the agreement could leave Britain unable to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mr Trump's comments ""were not unexpected"" and negotiations on a trade deal with the US were always going to be ""challenging"". ""The United States is a tough negotiator,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""President Trump's always said very plainly 'I put America first'. Well, I'd expect the British prime minister to put British interests first."" The comments came after Mrs May fought off criticism of her Brexit deal from MPs on all sides of the Commons on Monday - insisting the agreement would allow the UK to regain control of laws, money and borders. Please upgrade your browser In other developments: Research published by the London School of Economics, King's College and the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests thePM's Brexit deal could leave the economy as much as 5.5% smallerin 10 years time than it would be if the UK stayed in the EU Judges at the European Court of Justice are to examinewhether the UK can call off the process of leaving the EU without permission from member states, following a challenge by a group of Scottish politicians International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is visiting Israel to boost economic ties ahead of Brexit By BBC North America editor Jon Sopel Theresa May took a kicking in the House of Commons and then her closest ally, in the shape of Donald Trump, puts on his size 12 hobnail boots and joins in. When Donald Trump fired a broadside at Theresa May's Brexit deal there was nothing accidental or off the cuff about it. Senior members of his administration maintain close contacts with prominent eurosceptics in the Conservative party. But when the president says the agreement could jeopardise trade with the UK, it's hard to see what he means. During the transition period, business with the US would presumably carry on in exactly the same way as it does now. Yet all the time that Britain is in some way yoked to EU rules then there are limits to what can be negotiated in terms of a free trade deal - all points that have been made by those who campaigned for a more decisive Brexit. This intervention, coming post deal and pre-Commons vote, can only be interpreted in one way - the president is siding with the prime minister's critics. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Brexit deal. Sir Michel Fallon has launched a scathing attack on Mrs May's Brexit deal, labelling it ""doomed"". The senior Conservative and long-standing party loyalist echoed Mr Corbyn's words when he described the deal as ""the worst of all worlds"". Asked if the prime minister was now also doomed, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""That's up to my colleagues."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played Theresa May on Northern Ireland backstop: ""This is an insurance policy no-one wants to use."" As part of her two-week bid to convince MPs and the British public to back her deal, Mrs May will tell politicians and employers in Wales on Tuesday that they will have more power after Brexit, with more than 150 areas of policy passing to devolved parliaments and assemblies. She will also highlight the potential benefits to farmers of leaving the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Then in Northern Ireland, she will tell representatives of the five main political parties her deal will allow employers to ""trade freely across the border with Ireland and have unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom's market"". Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A guide to where we are with Brexit A really simple guide to Brexit Northern Ireland has featured heavily in discussions about Brexit because both the UK and the EU want to avoid a physical border - with guard posts and checks - between it and the Republic of Ireland. The agreement includes a ""backstop"" - a fall-back position - that would mean Northern Ireland would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products if a long-term trade deal is not agreed. The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May's government, has accused the PM of breaking her promise that Northern Ireland would never be treated any differently from the rest of the UK - but the PM has said the backstop was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Even the prime minister's own cabinet can't bring themselves to sell this deal."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, under the terms of legislation already passed by Parliament. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Brexit deal. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said government officials were probably working on a ""plan B"" in case the deal was rejected but there would be ""no whisper of it"" publicly until the outcome of the Commons vote. He told the BBC that while the option of seeking changes to the withdrawal agreement remained on the table, if the defeat was extremely heavy then more radical alternatives, such as extending the talks, would have to be considered. ""If Parliament rejects the deal by a significant majority and no deal is not now unacceptable there is a responsibility on the government to look seriously at options they have previously ruled out,"" he told Radio 4's Today.

"""Sounds like a great deal for the EU,"" is a pretty broad statement. But President Trump was talking in particular about the prospects for future trade agreements. ""Right now, if you look at the (Brexit) deal,"" he said, ""they (the UK) may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn't be a good thing."" Of course, that shouldn't be taken literally - it doesn't mean no trade at all. But as long as the UK remains in a transition period after Brexit, or in a temporary customs union, it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, cutting or removing tariffs on goods, with the United States or any other third country. That much is clear, but trade deals aren't just about tariffs. They are also about rules and regulations (known as non-tariff barriers) which are often more important. And from an ""America-first"" perspective, it's fair to assume that the president thinks Theresa May's Brexit deal makes it more likely that the UK will stay fairly close to the EU in the long term, by following the same (or very similar) regulations in various sectors of the economy. That is a key point. Because the closer the UK stays to the EU's common rules and standards, the more difficult it will be for it to move closer to the rules and standards followed in the United States. We're talking here not just about examples which come up regularly, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef (broadly speaking, both are allowed in the US and not in the EU), but also about industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Many big businesses in the UK want to stay close to all those EU rules (its regulatory framework) because the EU is a huge consumer market right on their doorstep. And they tend to follow the EU rules for their global operations because that simply makes things easier. The numbers are also instructive here.Last year,externalthe UK exported Â£274bn of goods and services to the rest of the EU and imported Â£341bn. The figures for trade with the United States were Â£112bn of exports and Â£70bn of imports. So, the EU will remain the UK's most important trading partner for some time to come. And if the president was hoping Brexit would mean a more decisive break between the UK and the EU, he may be disappointed. Hence, ""a great deal for the EU"". There is genuine competition in this field between the United States and the European Union. The EU may not be a military or diplomatic superpower, but it is a regulatory superpower. That means one of the big choices the UK will have to make in its negotiations on post-Brexit trade agreements is which regulatory and legal orbit it chooses to operate in. It's not an absolute ""either-or"" decision, but the UK will have to lean one way or the other. The non-binding political declaration on future UK-EU trade, approved by EU leaders on Sunday, makes this clear. The EU is insisting on various ""level playing field"" conditions to ensure that the UK cannot gain a competitive advantage by continuing to have privileged access to the EU market without following its rules. The political declaration says the level playing field should cover ""state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change and relevant tax matters"", and a separate statement issued by the leaders of the EU27 emphasises that they will ""demonstrate particular vigilance"" to ensure that these conditions are followed to the letter. The declaration also recognises that the UK will develop an independent trade policy in the future. But it stresses that if the goal is to have frictionless trade with the EU, that will depend on how closely aligned the UK remains with the single market and the customs union. We're back to the unresolved argument about the right balance between economic access and sovereignty. So where does that leave the UK's future trade relationship with the US? Downing Street points out that there have already been five working-group meetings to discuss the matter. But this may not be quite the Brexit that Donald Trump had in mind.

"TV debates have become a fixture of the campaign trail ahead of elections and big votes Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed to take part in a live TV debate on Brexit before MPs vote on the deal. The prime minister said she was the only one with a plan for the UK's future - Labour said Mr Corbyn would ""relish"" the chance to challenge that. Mrs May refused to take part in TV debates with Mr Corbyn in the run-up to last year's general election. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involvedto ensure a range of views is reflected. However, Mrs May has rejected calls for smaller political parties to join in, saying she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them. This video can not be played Ex-No 10 communications chief Sir Craig Oliver and Telegraph associate editor Camilla Tominey discuss the possible line-up Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Mrs May should be holding a debate with ""someone who believes in Brexit"", saying there was ""no point"" in the head-to-head with the Labour leader and that it offered a ""false choice"". He wrote on Twitter: ""Debates are great for democracy - but rather than widening discourse, this debate is narrowing it by offering a false choice between May's failing deal and Corbyn's vague proposals - neither of which are Brexit. ""There is no point having a debate with two people who voted Remain and deals that don't take back control."" Mrs May is beginning a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit deal to the public and MPs, before the vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A guide to where we are with Brexit What happens if MPs reject the deal? Reality Check's guide to the withdrawal agreement A day after the suggestion was first mooted in the Daily Telegraph, she told theSun,externalthe format of the debate would be ""a matter for broadcasters to determine"", but she was on board. ""I am going to be explaining why I think this deal is the right deal for the UK - and yes, I am ready to debate it with Jeremy Corbyn. ""Because I have got a plan. He hasn't got a plan."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said no date had yet been chosen for the debate, but it's expected to happen a few days before the vote. Other parties reject the idea of a May-Corbyn head to head as they want a chance to have their say too Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable demanded to be involved as well, because, as he put it, neither the Conservatives nor Labour had called for a new referendum on the deal. The Greens, too, said any debate must be cross-party and diverse. In a tweet, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""I'm ready to make sure Wales's voice is heard in any TV debate."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she would be ""up for a full leaders' debate on the 'deal'"". UKIP also wants its leader Gerard Batten to be involved in the debate. On Sunday, EU leaders approved the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future relations, which Mrs May has negotiated. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.

"Protests in Paris at the weekend attracted thousands Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will not abandon a controversial fuel tax, as he set out France's future energy strategy. The so-called yellow vests protests have seen thousands take to the streets across France over fuel prices. But Mr Macron struck a conciliatory tone, saying he was open to ideas and revising how the fuel tax was applied. He also announced that France would close all coal power stations by 2022, along with a number of nuclear plants. In his speech on Tuesday, Mr Macron said: ""I am not confusing the rioters with citizens who want to convey a message. ""I sympathise with my fellow citizens, but I will not give in to violence."" He said ""you cannot be pro-environment on Monday and then when Tuesday comes be against rising fuel prices"". But in a concession, he said the controversial tax could be adjusted when fuel prices soared to ease the burden on motorists. Police clash with Paris fuel protesters Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work He pointed to decades of French policy encouraging citizens to move farther from cities and travel by road. ""We pushed them into this situationâ¦ they are the victims of this situation, they have not created it,"" he said. ""We should listen to the social alarm and protests, but there is also an environmental alarm."" He acknowledged that many citizens felt the policy was being imposed on them without consultation. After his speech, French broadcaster BFMTV reported that the ecology minister would meet with representatives from the yellow vests movement later on Tuesday. Mr Macron's approval ratings have dropped sharply this year France is heavily dependent on nuclear power, which Mr Macron pledged to reduce to 50% of the national energy mix by 2035 by closing 14 of the country's 58 reactors. None, however, will be closed before 2022 with the exception of Fessenheim on the German border. That is on top of the closure of all four of France's remaining coal-fired power plants and investment of billions of euros into renewable energy. Mr Macron's approval rating has fallen steadily in recent months, with his deeply unpopular fuel tax increase adding to his political woes. Thegilets jaunesrallies were originally about fuel tax increases. Protesters donned the yellow vest required to be carried in every vehicle by law and blocked roads, causing widespread traffic jams. This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon fired on fuel price protesters by Paris police But the protests have now spread to encompass rising anger at high taxes and living costs, and span the entire political spectrum - even the far right, which the government blamed for violence in Paris at the weekend. Those protests saw the famous Champs-ElysÃ©es packed with 5,000 people with thousands more spread across the rest of the capital. Tear gas and a water cannon were used to disperse crowds after barricades were erected on the capital's streets and a small number of protesters tried to break a security cordon. Most demonstrators have remained peaceful. Butone person died during the protests when they were struck by a panicked driver. A few days later, a motorcyclist was also killed when they were hit by a van making a sudden turn in the traffic chaos. But Mr Macron is also facing opposition from the political class. On Tuesday, 12 of France's 13 regional leaders called on Mr Macron to reconsider the fuel tax. In the letter, published in French newspaper L'Opinion, the regional presidents called for a moratorium on the tax, writing that it would be a ""serious mistake"" to characterise the widespread protests as an extremist movement. Instead, they wrote, it was indicative of widespread anger of citizens forced to live further and further from their place of work and spend more on travel. The collected presidents also added that they were not against environmental taxes, but rather in favour of taking the time to improve the proposals. After his Tuesday speech, Mr Macron's political opponents decried what they described as a lack of action. Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said the president's words were ""devoid of any solutions"", and the only thing he had convinced her of was the need for change. Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon of the leftist France Unbowed group labelled the speech ""an hour of noise"" without any answers, while Socialist Olivier Faure wrote that the president ""says that he hears [the complaints], but does not understand"".

"One of the three men, Andriy Drach, was described as a Ukrainian security service employee Statements by three captured Ukrainians have been released by Russia's security service after Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian boats off the coast of Russian-annexed Crimea. One of the men, Volodymyr Lisovyi, said he was aware of the ""provocative nature"" of the Ukrainian action. Ukraine's navy commander said the men had been forced to lie under duress. Meanwhile, a Crimean court ordered that 12 of the 24 Ukrainians seized on Sunday be detained for 60 days. The court is expected to issue rulings for the remaining servicemen on Wednesday. Western nations have condemned Russia's use of force, four years after it seized Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula. The flare-up is the first outright clash between Ukraine and Russian forces for years, although pro-Russian separatists and Russian military ""volunteers"" have been fighting Ukraine's army in two eastern regions. Stakes are high in Ukraine-Russia sea clash Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high Tensions escalated when Russia opened a bridge this year between Russia and Crimea over the Kerch Strait, which leads into the Sea of Azov. Ukraine has two big ports on the northern shore of the Azov sea, and a 2003 treaty allows both countries free access to its waters. Russia has accused the two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug of violating Russian territorial waters as they sailed through the Kerch Strait. But Ukraine says the incidents happened in areas that are free to shipping. On Monday night, Ukraine's parliament responded by backing President Petro Poroshenko's decision to impose martial law for a 30-day period from 26 November in 10 border regions. On Tuesday, President Poroshenko said there was a threat of ""full-scale war"" with Russia. ""The number of [Russian] tanks at bases located along our border has grown three times,"" he said. Five of the 10 regions border Russia while two are adjacent to Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed. The other three regions border the Black Sea or Sea of Azov close to Crimea. The Ukrainian navy has published photos of its ships that were damaged by Russian fire Since April 2014, Ukraine's army has been fighting pro-Russian separatists in two eastern regions of Ukraine bordering Russia, Luhansk and Donetsk. The move to martial law is unprecedented in Ukraine, and gives military authorities the right to ban protests and strikes. Mobilisation of civilians for military service is possible but not inevitable. Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter The Ukrainian sailors were captured by Russia on Sunday and at least three were wounded. Late on Monday night, the FSB security service released videos of three of the men: Andriy Drach said he was on the Nikopol gunboat with an order to sail from Odessa to Mariupol. ""We were warned by the border service of the Russian Federation that we were violating Russian law. They had repeatedly asked us to leave the territorial waters of the Russian Federation,"" he said Serhiy Tsybizov said he was also on the Nikopol Volodymyr Lisovyi said he was commander of a military unit and was part of a naval task force. ""I deliberately ignored requests via ultra-short-wave band,"" adding that there were small arms on board as well as machine-guns Volodymyr Lisovyi was one of three men who gave statements described as ""under duress"" by the head of Ukraine's navy The head of the Ukrainian navy, Ihor Voronchenko, told Ukrainian TV that the three men had given false statements under duress. ""I know those sailors from Nikopol. They have always been honest professionals in their jobs, and what they say now is not true,"" he said. The head of Ukraine's SBU security service, Vasyl Hrytsak, confirmed Russian reports that members of the service were on board the boats, but added that it was a ""routine counter-intelligence mission"" of a type that the Russian navy carried out regularly. Several countries have condemned Russia's actions on Monday, and the UN Security Council failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda, and instead discussed a Ukrainian proposal on the issue. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the seizure of Ukrainian ships was a ""dangerous escalation and a violation of international law"". President Donald Trump said: ""We do not like what's happening, either way we don't like what's happening and hopefully they'll get straight."" The UK condemned Russia's ""destabilising behaviour in the region and its ongoing violation of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty"". Taking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had ""deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation"", the Kremlin said. Mrs Merkel had ""stressed the need for de-escalation and dialogue"", her spokesman said. Crimea: Who controls its territorial waters? Russia-Ukraine hostility explained.

"Kiara Moore's parents ran an outdoor pursuits business After fearing their car had been stolen with their two-year-old daughter inside, a couple then found it had rolled into a river, an inquest heard. Kiara Moore was found inside the vehicle in the River Teifi, Cardigan, in March and later pronounced dead. In recording a conclusion of misadventure, coroner Peter Brunton called it ""a catastrophic event"" to happen to any parents. Kiara had been left alone for two minutes as her mother went to get cash. In a statement issued after the inquest, Kiara's family said she was ""an amazing little girl who lived a life full of love and adventure"". The hearing at Aberystwyth Justice Centre was told the silver Mini was parked on a slipway outside the family business, Adventure Beyond, on 21 March. Kiara's mother Kim Rowlands put her daughter in the vehicle at about 15:30 GMT and went to get cash from inside the business. When she returned the car had ""vanished"" and police were called. But CCTV footage showed in the two minutes Ms Rowlands had left Kiara, the car had rolled into the river. A tribute from Kiara's nursery, Cylch Meithrin Drefach Felindre, was left on the riverside PCSO Caryl Griffiths, who dived into the water when the car was located in the river, broke down as she described to the inquest her efforts to get to Kiara. ""I dived head first into the river, the water was freezing cold and I could tell the current was really strong, pulling my head under the water. ""It was dirty and I could not see anything underwater."" Another police officer joined and helped Ms Griffiths smash a window. ""I immediately felt Kiara's body float out of the car into my arms,"" she said, adding she knew it was the toddler as she was wearing a pink jacket described by her parents. Kiara funeral to be 'bright and beautiful' Mum 'so sorry' for girl's river death Social media warning after child's death Ms Griffiths said after she got Kiara's body to shore, another officer began performing CPR. The girl was flown to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she was pronounced dead. But the inquest was told Kiara would have drowned within 30 seconds of the car entering the water. In a statement Ms Rowlands described her daughter ""singing, shouting and laughing"" when she left her, but not strapped in and in a ""mischievous mood"". She said her only guess was she had ""a funny five minutes"". This video can not be played Tributes were paid to two-year-old Kiara Moore Her father, Jet Moore, said there had not been any issues with the Mini apart from ""normal wear and tear"" and Kiara knew not to play with the controls and ""had no interest"". The inquest was told the vehicle was found in third gear without the handbrake applied. Forensic vehicle examiner Aled Thomas said the handbrake was efficient and it would have taken ""some effort"" to release it. The cause of Kiara's death was given as immersion, with the coroner saying on the balance of probabilities, the handbrake had not been set when Kiara was left in the car. No charges were brought by Dyfed-Powys Police. Coastguard rescue teams and the RNLI searched the River Teifi The family's statement said: ""She left us all with a huge gap in our lives this year. ""Since she has been gone, not a day has passed where we have not spoken about her life with us, her brother, sisters and wider family. ""We had so many adventures with her in her short life."" 'No blame' over girl's car drowning death Kiara funeral to be 'bright and beautiful' No charges over toddler's river death Mum 'so sorry' for girl's river death Child rescued from car in river Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"This video can not be played Foster: This is not the right deal for Northern Ireland The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has accused Theresa May of ""giving up"" on getting a better Brexit deal. The prime minister visited Northern Ireland on Tuesday as part of her two-week push to sell her agreement. She met the five main political parties at Stormont after a visit to Queen's University in Belfast. Speaking to the BBC, Mrs Foster accused her of engaging in ""propaganda"" but the prime minister rejected that claim. Companies 'cannot cope' with no-deal Brexit Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - Dodds Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This video can not be played The Brexit deal will allow people in NI to ""live their lives as they do today"", said Theresa May Mrs May began the day in Wales before travelling to Belfast, where she met students and business leaders. During her visit to Queen's University, she issued a thinly-veiled message to the DUP, urging MPs to ""think about the national interest"" when considering her Brexit deal. She called on them to ""think about the people that they represent"" when they vote in the Commons on 11 December on whether to accept or reject the agreement. She saidthe deal that was on the table protected Northern Ireland. The prime minister added that she had heard positive feedback during her visit to Northern Ireland about ""the certainty this deal provides"". The terms of the withdrawal agreement wereapproved by the 27 other EU leaders at a summit on Sunday. The prime minister spoke to students and business leaders at Queen's University in Belfast Speaking before meeting the prime minister at Stormont, Mrs Foster saidthe DUP remained opposed to the deal. But she added that if Mrs May ""ditches the backstop there is every reason to think that this agreement could go through"". The DUP leader said the prime minister was ""wasting her time"" trying to sell the agreement because it would not get the backing of Parliament. The party has warned that it willreview its parliamentary pact with the Conservatives, which props up Mrs May's government, if the deal is approved by MPs. Mrs Foster said she knew that ""people are fed up"" but added that it was not a reason to ""accept what's on the table"". She also said it was ""offensive"" to suggest that there could be last-minute financial inducements from the government that could get the DUP on board. Northern Ireland's four anti-Brexit parties have wanted to meet Theresa May together Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland, which are all anti-Brexit, met Mrs May on Tuesday. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said afterwards that the proposed withdrawal agreement was ""not perfect but it is the least worst option"". ""The alternative is a catastrophic crash out - any suggestion that it can now be renegotiated is fanciful,"" she added. She also said that the four parties opposed to Brexit were determined to ""prevent a hard border and protect jobs, investment and households from disaster"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged the protection of the backstop mechanism at all costs ""regardless of what happens"" on the day of the Commons vote on the deal. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said that across Northern Ireland ""people have made it very clear that they do not want to see a no-deal situation"". Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann also met Mrs May and said he told her to ask the EU for more time ""to look for alternatives"" to her agreement rather than ""risk the future of the union for the sake of meeting a deadline"". He called for the Article 50 period, under which the UK's departure date from the European Union has been fixed for 29 March 2019 regardless of whether a deal is agreed, to be extended.

"If you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home. How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance? Has she finally met her impossible task? In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something. And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too. Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union... ....or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU... ...or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. This video can not be played Meet some of the MPs bidding to vote down Theresa May's Brexit plan But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town. And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too. And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line. It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try. We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal?

"TV debates have become a fixture of the campaign trail ahead of elections and big votes Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed to take part in a live TV debate on Brexit before MPs vote on the deal. The prime minister said she was the only one with a plan for the UK's future - Labour said Mr Corbyn would ""relish"" the chance to challenge that. Mrs May refused to take part in TV debates with Mr Corbyn in the run-up to last year's general election. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involvedto ensure a range of views is reflected. However, Mrs May has rejected calls for smaller political parties to join in, saying she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them. This video can not be played Ex-No 10 communications chief Sir Craig Oliver and Telegraph associate editor Camilla Tominey discuss the possible line-up Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Mrs May should be holding a debate with ""someone who believes in Brexit"", saying there was ""no point"" in the head-to-head with the Labour leader and that it offered a ""false choice"". He wrote on Twitter: ""Debates are great for democracy - but rather than widening discourse, this debate is narrowing it by offering a false choice between May's failing deal and Corbyn's vague proposals - neither of which are Brexit. ""There is no point having a debate with two people who voted Remain and deals that don't take back control."" Mrs May is beginning a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit deal to the public and MPs, before the vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A guide to where we are with Brexit What happens if MPs reject the deal? Reality Check's guide to the withdrawal agreement A day after the suggestion was first mooted in the Daily Telegraph, she told theSun,externalthe format of the debate would be ""a matter for broadcasters to determine"", but she was on board. ""I am going to be explaining why I think this deal is the right deal for the UK - and yes, I am ready to debate it with Jeremy Corbyn. ""Because I have got a plan. He hasn't got a plan."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said no date had yet been chosen for the debate, but it's expected to happen a few days before the vote. Other parties reject the idea of a May-Corbyn head to head as they want a chance to have their say too Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable demanded to be involved as well, because, as he put it, neither the Conservatives nor Labour had called for a new referendum on the deal. The Greens, too, said any debate must be cross-party and diverse. In a tweet, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""I'm ready to make sure Wales's voice is heard in any TV debate."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she would be ""up for a full leaders' debate on the 'deal'"". UKIP also wants its leader Gerard Batten to be involved in the debate. On Sunday, EU leaders approved the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future relations, which Mrs May has negotiated. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.

"This video can not be played Paul Lister, Primark's head of ethical trade, is asked to justify its low prices by Mary Creagh MP Big-name retailers have defended selling clothes for Â£5 or less, saying their ability to sell clothes so cheaply is down to business models. MPs investigating the impact ofso-called ""fast fashion""asked the firms how they could justify such low prices. Primark's spokesman Paul Lister said the firm spent nothing on advertising and had tight profit margins. Representatives from brands including Boohoo, Misguided, Asos, Burberry and Marks & Spencer also gave evidence. Can the fashion industry become more sustainable? Where the clothes you throw away end up Are we buying too many clothes? The Commons environmental audit committee (EAC) is examining the impact of clothes production, especially those items produced cheaply and quickly in response to trends - known as ""fast fashion"". This video can not be played We asked shoppers in London what their priorities are for when shopping for clothes Labour MP Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, asked Primark's head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability, Paul Lister: ""How can you justify selling T-shirts in your stores for as little as Â£2 or Â£3, and how can you be making a profit on those?"" He replied: ""Primark has never done any significant advertising at all, and that can save us in any year Â£100m to Â£150m, compared to some of our larger rivals. That goes straight into price. That keeps our pricing low."" ""It's our business model that takes us to a Â£2 T-shirt."" On waste, Mr Lister said Primark had very little unused stock and was planning to launch a take-back scheme for consumers next year, where old clothes can be returned and used again by overseas charities. Ms Creagh suggested that by making garments so cheaply, they were being devalued. But Mr Lister insisted: ""Every item that we make, we're looking at durabilityâ¦ we are proud of the quality and durability of our garments, they're not built to throw away."" The term describes our high rate of fashion consumption fuelled by the availability of new and cheap clothing. Producing clothes requires climate-changing emissions. Global textile production produces 1.2bn tonnes of carbon emissions a year - more than international flights and maritime shipping. Last month, MPs on the EAC concluded that the fast fashion industry was amajor source of the greenhouse gasesthat are overheating the planet. MPs believe that the throwaway nature of fashion is also fuelling fast turnarounds among suppliers, which may result in poor working conditions. Elsewhere, Carol Kane, joint CEO of online fashion house Boohoo, was asked how the company could sell dresses for as little as Â£5 when the minimum wage was Â£7.83. She said this only applied to a small number of dresses intentionally sold at a loss, to drive more traffic to the site. Ms Kane, asked if consumers were now too accustomed to cheap, disposable clothes, said: ""I believe this all comes back to consumer demand. I've been in the industry for 32 years, and in that time I've seen prices decline."" Speaking on the same issue, Jamie Beck, from the Arcadia group, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, said: ""These garments aren't designed to be a disposable item, to be bought for [just] a holiday. They're designed to be long-lasting."" Burberry has been criticised for destroying stock During the hearing, high-end fashion brand Burberry also defended criticism from MPs for dumping clothes. Earlier this year, the firm was strongly criticised for burning Â£30m ($40m) of stock.It admitted destroying the unsold clothes, accessories and perfumeinstead of selling them off cheaply, in order to protect the brand's exclusivity and value. Leanne Wood, Burberry's chief of corporate affairs, told MPs the firm was ""committed"" to stopping the activity, but added: ""It is an industry practice. We're the only luxury business that's reported it in their accountsâ¦ but it is something that happens in the industry."" Boohoo, Misguided and Asos were also quizzed on relationships with suppliers accused of exploiting workers in Britain. Paul Smith, head of product quality and supply at Misguided, said the firm had cut the number of businesses it worked with in Leicester - where many of the factories are based - from 35 to just 20 due to concerns about pay and conditions at some sites there. Pretty Little Thing is one of Boohoo's brands After the hearing, Ms Creagh said: ""Evidence we heard today justifies our concerns that the current system allows fashion retailers to mark their own homework when it comes to workers' rights, fair pay and sustainability. ""Marks and Spencer are supposed to be a leading light in corporate responsibility, but even they pulled out of a scheme seeking to achieve living wages for garment workers through collective bargaining. ""Boohoo did not convince us that it had a grip on the potential illegal underpayment of their Leicester-based workers."" She added that it was ""shocking"" to learn during the hearing that Misguided staff who went to check on conditions at a factory were allegedly assaulted by its owners, adding that it ""begs the question - what on Earth was going on inside?"".

"Thomas Cook has warned that its annual profits are set to be about Â£30m lower than expected, its second profit warning in two months. Earnings at its tour operator unit were Â£88m lower in the year to September, as people delayed booking holidays because of the prolonged heatwave at home. It also said its bookings for this winter were 3% down on last year and suspended its dividend. Thomas Cook shares fell nearly 30% in early trade before recovering slightly. Shares in rival travel firm Tui were also hit, dropping 3.4%. Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it had been a ""disappointing year"". He added: ""The UK was particularly hard hit with very high levels of promotional activity coming on top of an already competitive market for holidays to Spain. ""Looking ahead, we must learn the lessons from 2018 and go into the new year focused on where we can make a difference to customers in our core holiday offering."" Club 18-30: Thomas Cook to close holiday brand this month Thomas Cook axes trips to SeaWorld over animal welfare concerns Thomas Cook resumes flights to Tunisia The company explained that the delay in holiday bookings caused by the heat meant its ability to make a profit from last-minute sales was restricted as a result. Most people buy their summer holidays in January, but there is also what is known as the ""lates"" market of bookings made from May onwards. This year's ""lates"" market coincided with the extreme heat in the UK, which affected bookings. The result was aggressive discounting of hotel rooms that had already been booked by the tour operators. Thomas Cook's profits were affected more than most because they had higher operating costs than their rivals. The heatwave and mild winter weather are also having an impact on Thomas Cook's bookings for winter holidays, with bookings for the 2018-19 season in continental Europe down by 2%. Fewer people have arranged holidays for the Canary Islands, with holidaymakers switching to cheaper trips to Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia instead. Thomas Cook's underlying earnings will be Â£250m to the end of September, Â£58m lower than in 2017. Additional charges, including disruption to flights, were partly responsible for this decline, the company said.

"The app analyses social media accounts for posts that might give parents cause for concern An app that claims to vet babysitters is being investigated by Facebook, and has been blocked altogether by Twitter. Predictim, based in California, offers a service that scours a prospective babysitterâs social media activity in order to provide a score out of five to suggest how safe they may or may not be. It looks for posts about drugs, violence of other undesirable content. Critics say algorithms should not be trusted to give advice on someoneâs employability. Earlier this month, after discovering the activity, Facebook revoked most of Predictimâs access to users, deeming the firm to be in violation of its policies on use of personal data. Facebook is now investigating whether to block the firm entirely from its platform after Predictim said it was still scraping public Facebook data in order to power its  algorithms. ""Everyone looks people up on social media, they look people up on Google,â said Predictim's chief executive and co-founder, Sal Parsa, ""Weâre just automating this process.â Facebook did not see it that way. âScraping people's information on Facebook is against our terms of service,â a spokeswoman said. ""We will be investigating Predictim for violations of our terms, including to see if they are engaging in scraping.â Meanwhile, Twitter told the BBC it had ârecentlyâ decided to block Predictimâs access to its users. âWe strictly prohibit the use of Twitter data and APIs for surveillance purposes, including performing background checks,â a spokeswoman said via email. ""When we became aware of Predictimâs services, we conducted an investigation and revoked their access to Twitter's public APIs."" An API - application programming interface - is used to allow different software to interact. In this case, Predictim would make use of Twitterâs API in order to quickly analyse a user's tweets. Predictim, which has been funded by a scheme set up the the University of California, gained considerable attention over the weekendthanks to a front-page story in the Washington Post,external. In it, experts warned of the fallibility of algorithms that might misinterpret the intent behind messages. Jamie Williams, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the newspaper: ""Kids have inside jokes. Theyâre notoriously sarcastic. Something that could sound like a âbad attitudeâ to the algorithm could sound to someone else like a political statement or valid criticism."" Predictim said it had a human review element to its system that meant posts flagged as being troublesome were looked at manually to prevent false negatives. As well as references to criminal behaviour, Predictim claims to be able to spot instances ""when an individual demonstrates a lack of respect, esteem, or courteous behaviour"". The company showed the BBC a demonstration dashboard that showed how users could see specific social media posts flagged as inappropriate to make their own judgements. The service charges $25 to run a scan of an applicantâs social media profiles, with discounts for multiple scans. The company said it was in discussions with major âshared economyâ companies to provide vetting for ride share drivers or accommodation service hosts. ""Itâs not blackbox magic,â Mr Parsa said. ""If the AI flags an individual as abusive, there is proof of why that person is abusive."" The firm insists it is not a tool designed to be used to make hiring decisions, and that the score is just a guide. However, on the siteâs dashboard, the company uses phrasing such as ""this person is very likely to display the undesired behaviour (high likelihood of being a bad hire)â.  Elsewhere on the dummy dashboard, the person in question is flagged as being âvery high riskâ. Mr Parsa pointed out a disclaimer at the bottom of the page that reads: âWe cannot provide any guarantee as to the accuracy of the analysis in the report or whether the subject of this report would be suitable for your needs.â The legality of firms scraping public social networking data without the consent of the sites in question is being tested in the courts. Professional networking site LinkedIn is currently locked in the US appeal courts with HiQ, a service that made use of publicly available LinkedIn data to create its own database. A lower court in California earlier ruled in favour of HiQ being allowed to make use of the data. ________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"England has failed to close the gap on the best-performing nations when it comes to cancer care despite 20 years of trying, analysis suggests. The review by the Health Foundation of the government's record between 1995 and 2015 said that despite four strategies setting ambitious goals, the NHS was still lagging behind the best. It said if services were improved, 10,000 lives could be saved each year. Ensuring earlier diagnosis was key, it said. Prof Sir Mike Richards, a former government cancer tsar who led the review, warned patients were finding it too difficult to get access to the tests and scans. ""Although progress has been made, the aims of all these strategies have not been achieved.""  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. He said the number of missed opportunities to save lives was the equivalent of a ""jumbo jet of people falling from the sky every two weeks"". It comes just a month after the prime minister promised to make early diagnosis of cancer a key priority for NHS spending in the coming years. Cancer waiting times 'at worst level ever' Survival rates are improving. Back in 2000, 62% of patients survived for at least a year. By 2015, this proportion had risen to 72%. Meanwhile, five-year survival has increased from 42% to 53%. But other nations have improved too. The Health Foundation highlighted the UK's performance against five other nations - Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. This was done for six key cancers - colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian and prostate. For each, the UK has remained in the bottom two since 2000 for five-year survival. Only on breast cancer has it actually closed the gap with the best. The think tank highlighted figures showing 10,000 deaths could be prevented each year with better diagnosis. That represents one in 13 deaths from the disease. Sir Mike talks about the ""tight gate-keeping"" in the NHS. He said GPs were under pressure not to refer too many patients, while the NHS did not have enough equipment or staff to carry out all the tests and scans it ideally should. Tackling this would require major investment, the report said. GPs refer nearly two million patients a year for urgent tests and scans - nearly four times the number they did over a decade ago. But the rise in referrals has coincided with long waiting times, with the NHS now struggling to meet its targets. And despite the extra numbers being referred, one in five cases is still diagnosed via an emergency presentation in places such as accident and emergency units. Patients diagnosed via this route are less likely to survive as the cancer has been diagnosed late. Sir Mike said services had also been undermined by the 2012 Health and Care Act, which led to regional cancer specialist groups being scrapped as part of the wider shake-up of the health service. He said this had prompted lots of experienced professionals to leave the NHS. Sir Mike welcomed the fact the government had promised extra funding - Â£20bn extra a year by 2023 - and that cancer would be a key focus for that. Last month, the prime minister promised a new strategy to ensure three-quarters of cancer were diagnosed early - currently only half are. NHS England is already piloting rapid diagnostic clinics. These are basically one-stop testing centres where patients can get access to a range of different specialists and procedures often on the same day. Sir Mike said these steps would help. He also called for more to be done to raise awareness among the public of the signs and symptoms to look out for - research shows people in the UK are sometimes reluctant to come forward when they are showing signs of cancer. And he said the NHS needed to look at new approaches, pointing to research showing people at high risk of lung cancer could benefit from a new form of screening for the disease by using low-dose CT scans. The Department of Health and Social Care said improving early diagnosis was a ""key priority"", pointing out from next year a new 28-day target for diagnosis would be rolled out.

"Former Tory minister and government whip Baroness Trumpington has died at the age of 96. The peer, whoretired from the Lords last year, served in the Department of Health and Ministry of Agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s. Seven years ago, footage showing her making a V-sign at a fellow Tory over what she saw as a rude remark about her age went viral online. In World War Two, she worked in naval intelligence at Bletchley Park. Fluent in French and German, the then 18-year-old  worked as a cypher clerk, transcribing messages from German submarines for code breakers. Obituary: Baroness Trumpington Before entering Parliament in 1980, Lady Trumpington was a councillor in Cambridge, where she later became mayor. In government, she served under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Lady Trumpington's death was confirmed by her son, Adam Barker, who said she had died on Monday afternoon in her sleep. He posted a photo of his mother's Parliamentary Pass on Twitter, which showed it still had four years to run: ""She did not make it to October 2022(100) ..but she had a bloody good innings"". Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Jean enjoyed a truly extraordinary career, from her work in intelligence at Bletchley Park during the Second World War to her decades of public service in local and national government, and in Parliament. ""She was a formidable figure in British politics and her kindness and humour will be sorely missed."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""So very sad to hear that Baroness Trumpington has passed away."" He added: ""She was one of a kind - they simply don't make politicians like that anymore. She will be sorely missed in Westminster but long remembered for her outstanding ability and great humour. RIP Trumpers.""

She had taken exception at remarks by the former defence secretary suggesting veterans of World War Two - of which she was the last remaining member in the Lords - were getting ""pretty old"". Lady Trumpington worked as a war-time land-girl on the farm owned by former PM, David Lloyd George She was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George. In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government. But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate. It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety. Read Baroness Trumpington's full obituary Conservative Party deputy chairman  James Cleverly, tweeted: ""So sad to hear that code-breaking, two finger-wagging, Baroness Trumpington has passed away. Ma'am, we salute you."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt described her as a ""trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy"", and added: ""Deepest sympathies to all who knew and loved this incredible woman. Socialite, mother, Bletchley Park code breaker, Baroness, Minister, trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy."" Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said she was ""admirable, decent and unique"". And Tory peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi said she was ""a huge inspiration"", tweeting: ""She always had time to deliver a good telling off, give advice or pay a compliment. I had the privilege of being at the receiving end of all three!"" Labour MP Kevin Brennan celebrated his ""admiration for a remarkable woman"".

"If you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home. How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance? Has she finally met her impossible task? In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something. And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too. Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union... ....or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU... ...or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. This video can not be played Meet some of the MPs bidding to vote down Theresa May's Brexit plan But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town. And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too. And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line. It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try. We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal?

"TV debates have become a fixture of the campaign trail ahead of elections and big votes Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed to take part in a live TV debate on Brexit before MPs vote on the deal. The prime minister said she was the only one with a plan for the UK's future - Labour said Mr Corbyn would ""relish"" the chance to challenge that. Mrs May refused to take part in TV debates with Mr Corbyn in the run-up to last year's general election. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involvedto ensure a range of views is reflected. However, Mrs May has rejected calls for smaller political parties to join in, saying she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them. This video can not be played Ex-No 10 communications chief Sir Craig Oliver and Telegraph associate editor Camilla Tominey discuss the possible line-up Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Mrs May should be holding a debate with ""someone who believes in Brexit"", saying there was ""no point"" in the head-to-head with the Labour leader and that it offered a ""false choice"". He wrote on Twitter: ""Debates are great for democracy - but rather than widening discourse, this debate is narrowing it by offering a false choice between May's failing deal and Corbyn's vague proposals - neither of which are Brexit. ""There is no point having a debate with two people who voted Remain and deals that don't take back control."" Mrs May is beginning a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit deal to the public and MPs, before the vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A guide to where we are with Brexit What happens if MPs reject the deal? Reality Check's guide to the withdrawal agreement A day after the suggestion was first mooted in the Daily Telegraph, she told theSun,externalthe format of the debate would be ""a matter for broadcasters to determine"", but she was on board. ""I am going to be explaining why I think this deal is the right deal for the UK - and yes, I am ready to debate it with Jeremy Corbyn. ""Because I have got a plan. He hasn't got a plan."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said no date had yet been chosen for the debate, but it's expected to happen a few days before the vote. Other parties reject the idea of a May-Corbyn head to head as they want a chance to have their say too Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable demanded to be involved as well, because, as he put it, neither the Conservatives nor Labour had called for a new referendum on the deal. The Greens, too, said any debate must be cross-party and diverse. In a tweet, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""I'm ready to make sure Wales's voice is heard in any TV debate."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she would be ""up for a full leaders' debate on the 'deal'"". UKIP also wants its leader Gerard Batten to be involved in the debate. On Sunday, EU leaders approved the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future relations, which Mrs May has negotiated. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.

"Matthew Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada said she was 'elated' after he was pardoned The pardoning of a British student sentenced to life imprisonment in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for spying has been welcomed by the UK government. But the balance of power between the countries is changing. The imprisonment of Matthew Hedges posed a real dilemma for the UK. It had to decide whether to stand up to the UAE, a country with which it does Â£15bn of trade, or cave in and risk the perception that it is now the junior partner in the relationship. Its strong response - and the fact Mr Hedges can now return home - is testament to the UK's diplomatic weight; this time the UAE flinched. But the UAE's continued insistence that the Durham PhD student is ""100% a secret service operative"" - a claim Mr Hedges denies - marks a significant shift after a century of UK supremacy in the countries' relationship. The UAE is clearly not Iran, which continues to detain UK nationals on similar charges includingNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe; it is a close and trusted partner. But in the case of Mr Hedges, the UK has been reminded that the UAE's de facto leader, Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (MBZ), is no pushover. He is used to getting his own way. Matthew Hedges was jailed in the UAE for spying - a charge he denies Unlike his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), MBZ is a strategic thinker. He has stayed very close to US President Donald Trump, but has also developed his relationship with both Russia and China. The UK is in danger of losing its favoured status in the UAE unless it can demonstrate that it is both a useful and reliable ally. There are deep historical ties between the UK and the families governing the seven emirates, but the nature of the relationship has changed over the years. The economic power that came with the the arrival of oil money has allowed the UAE's leaders to build new military and economic relationships. Today, it remains the case that a defining principle of the relationship with the UK is that Britain - along with the US and France - guarantees the UAE's security against external and internal threats. More like this The violent solar storms that threaten Earth Could these beautiful islands help stop killer diseases? The places where too many are fat and too many are thin But Abu Dhabi has come to doubt the integrity of such promises following the overthrow of another US ally -former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarakin 2011. As a result, it has begun to move away from its dependency upon Western powers. The Crown Prince has watched Russia's intervention in Syria and has come to admire the willingness of Moscow to stick with its ally through thick and thin. He has contrasted this with the positions adopted by the US and UK during the Arab uprisings; it seems he has never forgiven them for working with the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in June At the same time, Abu Dhabi has drawn lessons from former US President Barack Obama's failure to enforce his ""red lines"" over the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons. In the event that the UAE faces a major security threat, MBZ is concerned that the US or UK would drag their feet before responding - intervention is no longer in vogue. This has had a profound impact upon how he views traditional and new partners. Hence, MBZ will have wanted to test London's resolve around the case of Mr Hedges and he knows that Theresa May's government is under significant pressure, particularly as it looks for new trade deals to strike after Brexit. Arguably, the balance in the relationship has now reached equilibrium and the UK needs the UAE more than ever before. Indeed, there is a lot at stake. The UAE is the UK's largest export market in the Middle East and its fourth largest export market outside the EU. The UK exported Â£9.8bn of goods and services in 2016, which marked a 37% increase from 2009. There are more than 5,000 British companies operating in the UAE, including BP, Shell, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Mott MacDonald, Serco, Standard Chartered, HSBC and John Lewis. More than 779 commercial agencies and 4,762 British brands have invested in the UAE. British academic pardoned by UAE Who is Matthew Hedges? Why is the UAE's legal system being criticised? United Arab Emirates profile It has also been reported that UK arms exports to the UAE rose last year by 94% to Â£260m,,externala figure that does not take into account bumper sales of cyber-security support. Moreover, the UAE is not only an important market for the UK, but also a popular tourist destination visited by more than 1.25 million British tourists in 2016. It is also home to 120,000 British residents, whose livelihoods and way of life will be put at risk if the relationship between the two countries is damaged beyond repair. Mr Hedges' case has been a real test of nerve for both governments and while the UAE may have issued a pardon, there is no guarantee that MBZ will blink in any future dispute.

"Former Tory minister and government whip Baroness Trumpington has died at the age of 96. The peer, whoretired from the Lords last year, served in the Department of Health and Ministry of Agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s. Seven years ago, footage showing her making a V-sign at a fellow Tory over what she saw as a rude remark about her age went viral online. In World War Two, she worked in naval intelligence at Bletchley Park. Fluent in French and German, the then 18-year-old  worked as a cypher clerk, transcribing messages from German submarines for code breakers. Obituary: Baroness Trumpington Before entering Parliament in 1980, Lady Trumpington was a councillor in Cambridge, where she later became mayor. In government, she served under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Lady Trumpington's death was confirmed by her son, Adam Barker, who said she had died on Monday afternoon in her sleep. He posted a photo of his mother's Parliamentary Pass on Twitter, which showed it still had four years to run: ""She did not make it to October 2022(100) ..but she had a bloody good innings"". Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Jean enjoyed a truly extraordinary career, from her work in intelligence at Bletchley Park during the Second World War to her decades of public service in local and national government, and in Parliament. ""She was a formidable figure in British politics and her kindness and humour will be sorely missed."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""So very sad to hear that Baroness Trumpington has passed away."" He added: ""She was one of a kind - they simply don't make politicians like that anymore. She will be sorely missed in Westminster but long remembered for her outstanding ability and great humour. RIP Trumpers.""

She had taken exception at remarks by the former defence secretary suggesting veterans of World War Two - of which she was the last remaining member in the Lords - were getting ""pretty old"". Lady Trumpington worked as a war-time land-girl on the farm owned by former PM, David Lloyd George She was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George. In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government. But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate. It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety. Read Baroness Trumpington's full obituary Conservative Party deputy chairman  James Cleverly, tweeted: ""So sad to hear that code-breaking, two finger-wagging, Baroness Trumpington has passed away. Ma'am, we salute you.""

Socialite, mother, Bletchley Park code breaker, Baroness, Minister, trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy."" Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said she was ""admirable, decent and unique"".

I had the privilege of being at the receiving end of all three!"" Labour MP Kevin Brennan celebrated his ""admiration for a remarkable woman"".

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent? Half of tuition fees spent on teaching Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500 but higher for science?

Have a lovely weekend. Winds will slowly ease down this evening, with showers largely diminishing. During the early hours, skies will gradually cloud over from the south, though conditions should stay dry through to dawn. Minimum Temperature: 0 to 3C (32 to 37F). Tomorrow a  cloudy day is envisaged, with rain quickly spreading from the south to leave a wet morning. During the afternoon, most of the rain will clear east, leaving just a few showers and some brighter spells. Maximum Temperature: 3 to 6C (37 to 43F). The Magpie Group has called upon Newcastle supporters to refrain from taking their seats during the first 11 minutes of the West Ham match tomorrow. The action is in protest at the 11  years of Mike Ashley's tenure as owner of the club. According to the group, December is their last chance to put pressure upon the owner to support Rafa Benitez (pictured) in the January transfer window. There are concerns that the manager will not renew his contract next summer unless he receives backing. A group spokesman said 
""We encourage fans to take a stand in this fixture and in the game against Wolves, where we propose a full boycott. ""We know this is painful for Newcastle supporters to do but, for the longer term future of the club, it's time to tell those at the top that enough is enough"" Metro passengers will see a ""modest"" increase in single, day and season fares, Nexus has announced. The new prices will come into effect from 2 January. According to the new proposals, the cost of the Pop Pay As You Go smartcard will be frozen. This means students and customers who use it will be paying the same price for their travel in 2019 as they were in 2012. Meanwhile, single, day and season Metro tickets' price will go up by 10p. The increase is to help meet running costs. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is still without defender Paul Dummett for the
Magpies' Premier League clash with West Ham tomorrow. Dummett picked up a hamstring injury on international duty with Wales and is
expected to be ruled out for a number of weeks. Benitez can pick from a fully-fit squad, with captain Jamaal
Lascelles among those pushing for a return following a shoulder injury. Artefacts, including pottery, animal bone and a 600-year-old shoe have been uncovered during improvement works around Stephenson's Monument in Newcastle. The findings, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, suggest the area was used as waste ground or a garden. Chris Scott, senior
archaeologist at Solstice Heritage, said: âThe finds show that even 600 years ago, people in Newcastle
were fashionable, busy in business and linked closely with our continental neighbours
through trade.â Archaeologists investigated the area before improvement work began as part of transformation project, funded through the Regional Growth Fund. The social media challenge where people fill a trolley with donations was set up by a proud Gypsy. The Heerema HFG facility at Hartlepool is going up for sale but staff are hopeful a new owner will diversify the company's produce. The firm's Dutch headquarters is also up for sale.

We'll be back with more live updates from 08:00 on Monday. If you want to get in touch with any news or send us photos you cantweet us,external, contact us via ourFacebook page,externaloremail us. Have a lovely weekend. Winds will slowly ease down this evening, with showers largely diminishing. During the early hours, skies will gradually cloud over from the south, though conditions should stay dry through to dawn. Minimum Temperature: 0 to 3C (32 to 37F). Tomorrow a  cloudy day is envisaged, with rain quickly spreading from the south to leave a wet morning. During the afternoon, most of the rain will clear east, leaving just a few showers and some brighter spells. Maximum Temperature: 3 to 6C (37 to 43F). The Magpie Group has called upon Newcastle supporters to refrain from taking their seats during the first 11 minutes of the West Ham match tomorrow. The action is in protest at the 11  years of Mike Ashley's tenure as owner of the club. According to the group, December is their last chance to put pressure upon the owner to support Rafa Benitez (pictured) in the January transfer window. There are concerns that the manager will not renew his contract next summer unless he receives backing. A group spokesman said 
""We encourage fans to take a stand in this fixture and in the game against Wolves, where we propose a full boycott. ""We know this is painful for Newcastle supporters to do but, for the longer term future of the club, it's time to tell those at the top that enough is enough"" Metro passengers will see a ""modest"" increase in single, day and season fares, Nexus has announced. The new prices will come into effect from 2 January. According to the new proposals, the cost of the Pop Pay As You Go smartcard will be frozen. This means students and customers who use it will be paying the same price for their travel in 2019 as they were in 2012. Meanwhile, single, day and season Metro tickets' price will go up by 10p. The increase is to help meet running costs. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is still without defender Paul Dummett for the
Magpies' Premier League clash with West Ham tomorrow. Dummett picked up a hamstring injury on international duty with Wales and is
expected to be ruled out for a number of weeks. Benitez can pick from a fully-fit squad, with captain Jamaal
Lascelles among those pushing for a return following a shoulder injury. Artefacts, including pottery, animal bone and a 600-year-old shoe have been uncovered during improvement works around Stephenson's Monument in Newcastle. The findings, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, suggest the area was used as waste ground or a garden. Chris Scott, senior
archaeologist at Solstice Heritage, said: âThe finds show that even 600 years ago, people in Newcastle
were fashionable, busy in business and linked closely with our continental neighbours
through trade.â Archaeologists investigated the area before improvement work began as part of transformation project, funded through the Regional Growth Fund. The social media challenge where people fill a trolley with donations was set up by a proud Gypsy. The Heerema HFG facility at Hartlepool is going up for sale but staff are hopeful a new owner will diversify the company's produce. The firm's Dutch headquarters is also up for sale.

"Matthew Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada said she was 'elated' after he was pardoned The pardoning of a British student sentenced to life imprisonment in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for spying has been welcomed by the UK government. But the balance of power between the countries is changing. The imprisonment of Matthew Hedges posed a real dilemma for the UK. It had to decide whether to stand up to the UAE, a country with which it does Â£15bn of trade, or cave in and risk the perception that it is now the junior partner in the relationship. Its strong response - and the fact Mr Hedges can now return home - is testament to the UK's diplomatic weight; this time the UAE flinched. But the UAE's continued insistence that the Durham PhD student is ""100% a secret service operative"" - a claim Mr Hedges denies - marks a significant shift after a century of UK supremacy in the countries' relationship. The UAE is clearly not Iran, which continues to detain UK nationals on similar charges includingNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe; it is a close and trusted partner. But in the case of Mr Hedges, the UK has been reminded that the UAE's de facto leader, Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (MBZ), is no pushover. He is used to getting his own way. Matthew Hedges was jailed in the UAE for spying - a charge he denies Unlike his counterpart in Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), MBZ is a strategic thinker. He has stayed very close to US President Donald Trump, but has also developed his relationship with both Russia and China. The UK is in danger of losing its favoured status in the UAE unless it can demonstrate that it is both a useful and reliable ally. There are deep historical ties between the UK and the families governing the seven emirates, but the nature of the relationship has changed over the years. The economic power that came with the the arrival of oil money has allowed the UAE's leaders to build new military and economic relationships. Today, it remains the case that a defining principle of the relationship with the UK is that Britain - along with the US and France - guarantees the UAE's security against external and internal threats. More like this The violent solar storms that threaten Earth Could these beautiful islands help stop killer diseases? The places where too many are fat and too many are thin But Abu Dhabi has come to doubt the integrity of such promises following the overthrow of another US ally -former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarakin 2011. As a result, it has begun to move away from its dependency upon Western powers. The Crown Prince has watched Russia's intervention in Syria and has come to admire the willingness of Moscow to stick with its ally through thick and thin. He has contrasted this with the positions adopted by the US and UK during the Arab uprisings; it seems he has never forgiven them for working with the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in June At the same time, Abu Dhabi has drawn lessons from former US President Barack Obama's failure to enforce his ""red lines"" over the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons. In the event that the UAE faces a major security threat, MBZ is concerned that the US or UK would drag their feet before responding - intervention is no longer in vogue. This has had a profound impact upon how he views traditional and new partners. Hence, MBZ will have wanted to test London's resolve around the case of Mr Hedges and he knows that Theresa May's government is under significant pressure, particularly as it looks for new trade deals to strike after Brexit. Arguably, the balance in the relationship has now reached equilibrium and the UK needs the UAE more than ever before. Indeed, there is a lot at stake. The UAE is the UK's largest export market in the Middle East and its fourth largest export market outside the EU. The UK exported Â£9.8bn of goods and services in 2016, which marked a 37% increase from 2009. There are more than 5,000 British companies operating in the UAE, including BP, Shell, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Mott MacDonald, Serco, Standard Chartered, HSBC and John Lewis. More than 779 commercial agencies and 4,762 British brands have invested in the UAE. British academic pardoned by UAE Who is Matthew Hedges? Why is the UAE's legal system being criticised? United Arab Emirates profile It has also been reported that UK arms exports to the UAE rose last year by 94% to Â£260m,,externala figure that does not take into account bumper sales of cyber-security support. Moreover, the UAE is not only an important market for the UK, but also a popular tourist destination visited by more than 1.25 million British tourists in 2016. It is also home to 120,000 British residents, whose livelihoods and way of life will be put at risk if the relationship between the two countries is damaged beyond repair. Mr Hedges' case has been a real test of nerve for both governments and while the UAE may have issued a pardon, there is no guarantee that MBZ will blink in any future dispute.

"TV debates have become a fixture of the campaign trail ahead of elections and big votes Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed to take part in a live TV debate on Brexit before MPs vote on the deal. The prime minister said she was the only one with a plan for the UK's future - Labour said Mr Corbyn would ""relish"" the chance to challenge that. Mrs May refused to take part in TV debates with Mr Corbyn in the run-up to last year's general election. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involvedto ensure a range of views is reflected. However, Mrs May has rejected calls for smaller political parties to join in, saying she and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them. This video can not be played Ex-No 10 communications chief Sir Craig Oliver and Telegraph associate editor Camilla Tominey discuss the possible line-up Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said Mrs May should be holding a debate with ""someone who believes in Brexit"", saying there was ""no point"" in the head-to-head with the Labour leader and that it offered a ""false choice"". He wrote on Twitter: ""Debates are great for democracy - but rather than widening discourse, this debate is narrowing it by offering a false choice between May's failing deal and Corbyn's vague proposals - neither of which are Brexit. ""There is no point having a debate with two people who voted Remain and deals that don't take back control."" Mrs May is beginning a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit deal to the public and MPs, before the vote in the House of Commons on 11 December. Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A guide to where we are with Brexit What happens if MPs reject the deal? Reality Check's guide to the withdrawal agreement A day after the suggestion was first mooted in the Daily Telegraph, she told theSun,externalthe format of the debate would be ""a matter for broadcasters to determine"", but she was on board. ""I am going to be explaining why I think this deal is the right deal for the UK - and yes, I am ready to debate it with Jeremy Corbyn. ""Because I have got a plan. He hasn't got a plan."" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said no date had yet been chosen for the debate, but it's expected to happen a few days before the vote. Other parties reject the idea of a May-Corbyn head to head as they want a chance to have their say too Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable demanded to be involved as well, because, as he put it, neither the Conservatives nor Labour had called for a new referendum on the deal. The Greens, too, said any debate must be cross-party and diverse. In a tweet, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""I'm ready to make sure Wales's voice is heard in any TV debate."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she would be ""up for a full leaders' debate on the 'deal'"". UKIP also wants its leader Gerard Batten to be involved in the debate. On Sunday, EU leaders approved the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future relations, which Mrs May has negotiated. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.

"Paul Manafort was found guilty of multiple fraud charges US prosecutors say Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chief, has breached a plea bargain agreement by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud in Augustrelating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for co-operating with Robert Mueller's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Manafort's lawyers say they believe he provided truthful information However, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said that Manafort lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" after signing the plea deal. The latest development means that Mr Mueller's investigation has lost a key witness. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Manafort's lawyers insist that he did not breach the plea deal - however, both sides now agree that there is no reason to delay sentencing.

In August Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prisonand would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed. It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential elections. However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. The White House has insisted that the guilty plea had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump. In a court filing on Monday, Mr Mueller said that after signing the deal ""Manafort committed federal crimes by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel's office on a variety of subject matters"". The filing did not give details of what Manafort allegedly lied about. Paul Manafort's downfall has been celebrated by some In the same filing, Manafort's legal team said their client had ""provided information to the government in an effort to live up to his co-operation obligations"". ""He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government's characterisation or that he has breached the agreement,"" his lawyers said. As prosecutors allege he breached the agreement, Manafort could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed. Manafort has been held in a detention centre in Virginia since June. What did we learn from Manafort trial? This is seen as a blow to Mr Mueller's Russia probe. As investigators no longer believe Manafort is a credible witness, they will not be able to use his testimony in their case. Experts say Manafort could now face a longer prison sentence and more criminal charges. One lawyer told Reuters that the consequences could be ""potentially devastating"" for Manafort. However, some observers have speculated that Manafort might be hoping for a presidential pardon. Manafort, 69, worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. President Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt"" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly denied any meddling. Manafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October and at trial he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars.

"The plane took off from Devonport, in Tasmania's north A small plane overshot its destination in Australia by almost 50km (30 miles) after its pilot fell asleep in the cockpit, air safety officials say. The pilot was the only person on board the freight flight from Devonport to King Island in Tasmania on 8 November. The incident, classified as a case of ""incapacitation"", is being investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). Officials have not said how the pilot awoke before landing the plane safely. The Piper PA-31 aircraft, operated by Vortex Air, had been due to complete the 240km trip at 07:15 local time. ""During the cruise, the pilot fell asleep, resulting in the aircraft overflying King Island by 46 kilometres,"" the ATSB said in a brief statement. Aviation expert Neil Hansford said that Australia had strict rules relating to pilot fatigue. ""There is no way in the world that someone should've taken on that flight fatigued,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? Why you should listen to flight safety demos On its website, Vortex Air says it runs charter flights for ""groups, corporates and leisure travellers"" around Australia. The ATSB said it would interview the pilot and review operating procedures before releasing a report next year. Last year, five people died whena plane on its way to King Island crashed moments after takeoff in Melbourne.

"England has failed to close the gap on the best-performing nations when it comes to cancer care despite 20 years of trying, analysis suggests. The review by the Health Foundation of the government's record between 1995 and 2015 said that despite four strategies setting ambitious goals, the NHS was still lagging behind the best. It said if services were improved, 10,000 lives could be saved each year. Ensuring earlier diagnosis was key, it said. Prof Sir Mike Richards, a former government cancer tsar who led the review, warned patients were finding it too difficult to get access to the tests and scans. ""Although progress has been made, the aims of all these strategies have not been achieved.""  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. He said the number of missed opportunities to save lives was the equivalent of a ""jumbo jet of people falling from the sky every two weeks"". It comes just a month after the prime minister promised to make early diagnosis of cancer a key priority for NHS spending in the coming years. Cancer waiting times 'at worst level ever' Survival rates are improving. Back in 2000, 62% of patients survived for at least a year. By 2015, this proportion had risen to 72%. Meanwhile, five-year survival has increased from 42% to 53%. But other nations have improved too. The Health Foundation highlighted the UK's performance against five other nations - Canada, Australia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. This was done for six key cancers - colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian and prostate. For each, the UK has remained in the bottom two since 2000 for five-year survival. Only on breast cancer has it actually closed the gap with the best. The think tank highlighted figures showing 10,000 deaths could be prevented each year with better diagnosis. That represents one in 13 deaths from the disease. Sir Mike talks about the ""tight gate-keeping"" in the NHS. He said GPs were under pressure not to refer too many patients, while the NHS did not have enough equipment or staff to carry out all the tests and scans it ideally should. Tackling this would require major investment, the report said. GPs refer nearly two million patients a year for urgent tests and scans - nearly four times the number they did over a decade ago. But the rise in referrals has coincided with long waiting times, with the NHS now struggling to meet its targets. And despite the extra numbers being referred, one in five cases is still diagnosed via an emergency presentation in places such as accident and emergency units. Patients diagnosed via this route are less likely to survive as the cancer has been diagnosed late. Sir Mike said services had also been undermined by the 2012 Health and Care Act, which led to regional cancer specialist groups being scrapped as part of the wider shake-up of the health service. He said this had prompted lots of experienced professionals to leave the NHS. Sir Mike welcomed the fact the government had promised extra funding - Â£20bn extra a year by 2023 - and that cancer would be a key focus for that. Last month, the prime minister promised a new strategy to ensure three-quarters of cancer were diagnosed early - currently only half are. NHS England is already piloting rapid diagnostic clinics. These are basically one-stop testing centres where patients can get access to a range of different specialists and procedures often on the same day. Sir Mike said these steps would help. He also called for more to be done to raise awareness among the public of the signs and symptoms to look out for - research shows people in the UK are sometimes reluctant to come forward when they are showing signs of cancer. And he said the NHS needed to look at new approaches, pointing to research showing people at high risk of lung cancer could benefit from a new form of screening for the disease by using low-dose CT scans. The Department of Health and Social Care said improving early diagnosis was a ""key priority"", pointing out from next year a new 28-day target for diagnosis would be rolled out.

"Former Tory minister and government whip Baroness Trumpington has died at the age of 96. The peer, whoretired from the Lords last year, served in the Department of Health and Ministry of Agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s. Seven years ago, footage showing her making a V-sign at a fellow Tory over what she saw as a rude remark about her age went viral online. In World War Two, she worked in naval intelligence at Bletchley Park. Fluent in French and German, the then 18-year-old  worked as a cypher clerk, transcribing messages from German submarines for code breakers. Obituary: Baroness Trumpington Before entering Parliament in 1980, Lady Trumpington was a councillor in Cambridge, where she later became mayor. In government, she served under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Lady Trumpington's death was confirmed by her son, Adam Barker, who said she had died on Monday afternoon in her sleep. He posted a photo of his mother's Parliamentary Pass on Twitter, which showed it still had four years to run: ""She did not make it to October 2022(100) ..but she had a bloody good innings"". Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Jean enjoyed a truly extraordinary career, from her work in intelligence at Bletchley Park during the Second World War to her decades of public service in local and national government, and in Parliament. ""She was a formidable figure in British politics and her kindness and humour will be sorely missed."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""So very sad to hear that Baroness Trumpington has passed away."" He added: ""She was one of a kind - they simply don't make politicians like that anymore. She will be sorely missed in Westminster but long remembered for her outstanding ability and great humour. RIP Trumpers.""

She had taken exception at remarks by the former defence secretary suggesting veterans of World War Two - of which she was the last remaining member in the Lords - were getting ""pretty old"". Lady Trumpington worked as a war-time land-girl on the farm owned by former PM, David Lloyd George She was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George. In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government. But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate. It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety. Read Baroness Trumpington's full obituary Conservative Party deputy chairman  James Cleverly, tweeted: ""So sad to hear that code-breaking, two finger-wagging, Baroness Trumpington has passed away. Ma'am, we salute you."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt described her as a ""trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy"", and added: ""Deepest sympathies to all who knew and loved this incredible woman. Socialite, mother, Bletchley Park code breaker, Baroness, Minister, trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy."" Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said she was ""admirable, decent and unique"". And Tory peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi said she was ""a huge inspiration"", tweeting: ""She always had time to deliver a good telling off, give advice or pay a compliment. I had the privilege of being at the receiving end of all three!"" Labour MP Kevin Brennan celebrated his ""admiration for a remarkable woman"".

"Paul Manafort was found guilty of multiple fraud charges US prosecutors say Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chief, has breached a plea bargain agreement by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud in Augustrelating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for co-operating with Robert Mueller's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Manafort's lawyers say they believe he provided truthful information However, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said that Manafort lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" after signing the plea deal. The latest development means that Mr Mueller's investigation has lost a key witness. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Manafort's lawyers insist that he did not breach the plea deal - however, both sides now agree that there is no reason to delay sentencing. President Trump lashed out at the special counsel on Tuesday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In August Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prisonand would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed. It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential elections. However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. The White House has insisted that the guilty plea had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump. In a court filing on Monday, Mr Mueller said that after signing the deal ""Manafort committed federal crimes by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel's office on a variety of subject matters"". The filing did not give details of what Manafort allegedly lied about. Paul Manafort's downfall has been celebrated by some In the same filing, Manafort's legal team said their client had ""provided information to the government in an effort to live up to his co-operation obligations"". ""He believes he has provided truthful information and does not agree with the government's characterisation or that he has breached the agreement,"" his lawyers said. As prosecutors allege he breached the agreement, Manafort could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed. Manafort has been held in a detention centre in Virginia since June. What did we learn from Manafort trial? This is seen as a blow to Mr Mueller's Russia probe. As investigators no longer believe Manafort is a credible witness, they will not be able to use his testimony in their case. Experts say Manafort could now face a longer prison sentence and more criminal charges. One lawyer told Reuters that the consequences could be ""potentially devastating"" for Manafort. However, some observers have speculated that Manafort might be hoping for a presidential pardon. Manafort, 69, worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. President Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt"" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly denied any meddling. Manafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October and at trial he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud.

"This video can not be played Nyheke Lambert says her business ""would only work in London"" One in three new jobs created in the UK over the past decade has been in London, analysis shows. Employment has been rising across the country but by far the strongest growth has been in the capital, according to official employment statistics. Labour said its proposals would rebalance the economy away from south-east England. The UK Government said it was committed to boosting local growth outside of London. The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed official labour market figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from 2007-2017. It found: London's job creation rate outstrips its high population growth. Of the 2.7 million new jobs, almost 950,000, or 35%, were created in the capital The north-east of England saw the lowest percentage increase in new jobs of any UK region or nation, along with the lowest population increase More than half of jobs in London and the South East are now classed as skilled professional occupations In the north-east of England and Northern Ireland, the proportion of skilled professional jobs drops to 39% and 36% respectively Nyheke Lambert moved to London to start her own business London has long attracted young people looking to break into the city's established creative industries. Nyheke Lambert, 28, is a seamstress and pattern cutter, originally from Birmingham. She moved to London to start her business in order to be closer to potential clients. ""I needed to be among the greatest of the greatest. ""There just isn't the demand in Birmingham. Even when I was living there and freelancing, all of my clientele was in London - so I was still visiting every week for fittings. ""My life is in London now. The major downside is that it is very expensive. The cost of accommodation and renting a space for your business is extortionate. If you don't have investors or savings to fall back on, you are going to struggle."" Total employment in the UK has risen steadily over the last decade, with an average of 32 million people in work in 2017 - the most recent year for which full statistics are available. London was already the UK's most economically productive region before the 2008 financial crisis. It has since strengthened that position. ""What is more important than ever is access to knowledge, skills, ideas and high-skilled workers and London has that in abundance,"" said Naomi Clayton, policy and research manager at the Centre for Cities think tank. ""It relates to the story of the North-South divide and London versus the Rest, which has been around a very long time. If anything, given the structural changes taking place in the economy in terms of globalisation and automation, those forces are working to widen the divide."" Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, described London as a ""jobs machine"". ""The areas of the economy in which London has been historically strong are areas which have seen very strong growth in the last decade,"" he said. ""The UK is even more of a services-based economy now than it was 10 years ago. Regions which have been more reliant upon non-service sectors - such as manufacturing or construction - have done relatively less well."" Can you be 'employed' for one hour's work? UK wage growth fastest for nearly 10 years More staff hired in shrinking pub industry Employment in Wales grew by 6% over the period, while its population grew by 4% - the second lowest total of any UK nation or region behind the North East. The number of people in employment in Scotland has risen four per cent in the past decade, while its population increased by 4.7%. Sara West previously worked in the public sector in County Durham Employment in the north-east of England grew by 2.5% over the last decade, the slowest rate of any UK region or nation. The number of workers in the region employed in care or leisure work, customer service or sales roles, rose to one in five by 2017, the highest rate in the country. Sara West, 52, runs a business that hosts murder mystery weekends. She formerly worked in the communications department of Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. ""Leaving my job was terrifying,"" she said. ""I was leaping out of a secure permanent position to set up my own business. ""I wasn't necessarily confident about creating my own work, but it had reached the point that if I didn't try then I wouldn't know. ""If I couldn't do what I'm doing know, I think I would probably find myself in a minimum wage job. ""Because I'm now in my 50s, I don't think I would find such good employment again."" Total unemployment fell in August to 1.36 million - a rate of 4% and the lowest figure for more than 40 years. The UK Government has said the high employment rate was proof its economic policies were working. Following the 2018 Budget, Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, spoke of a ""real jobs miracle in this country"". But Professor Christopher Warhurst, director of the Warwick Institute for Employment Research, said companies were providing too many low-skilled, low-wage jobs. ""One thing the UK Government could do is what we call 'paving the high road' by creating not just more jobs, but better jobs,"" he said. ""UK Governments of all stripes have said in times of crisis that what we need are any jobs - but such employment has never been sustainable. ""Theresa May has said she understands ordinary people's problems. If she does, she needs to start blocking off the low road and start paving the high road."" London has witnessed a jobs boom in the last decade Both Labour and the Conservatives have revealed policies which they claim will boost growth in regions outside of London. John McDonnell MP, Labour's shadow chancellor of the exchequer, said: ""The Tories' mismanagement of our economy has been underpinned by workplace insecurity and low pay. ""Labour's proposals to rebalance the economy away from the South East include a network of Regional Development Banks, an ambitious industrial strategy, Â£250bn of government capital investment over ten years to upgrade Britain's physical infrastructure and a Community Wealth Building programme to learn from councils like Preston how to support local economies."" A spokeswoman for the UK government said: ""Since 2010, employment has risen in every region of the UK with 3.3 million new jobs, 90% of which were filled by UK nationals and three quarters were in permanent, full-time and high skilled roles. ""We are committed to boosting local growth outside of London which is why we have invested half a billion pounds into the Northern Powerhouse, and up until 2020 we are investing Â£250m in coastal communities to provide thousands of jobs, training places and new economic opportunities.""

"US President Donald Trump has said he is likely to go ahead with a hike on tariffs currently imposed on Chinese goods. The comments to the Wall Street Journal come as he is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of this week's G20 summit.

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent?

"If you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home. How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance? Has she finally met her impossible task? In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something. And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too. Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union... ....or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU... ...or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. This video can not be played Meet some of the MPs bidding to vote down Theresa May's Brexit plan But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town. And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too. And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line.

"EU leaders who gathered in Brussels put on a united front to back Theresa May's argument that the withdrawal agreement they endorsed was the ""best and only"" Brexit deal available. But there was no sense of celebration, and there were plenty of signs of how tough negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship are likely to be. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration on future ties, the remaining 27 EU leaders published a separate statement (without the UK) that vowed to protect their own interests, on a range of issues from fishing to fair competition to the rights of citizens. ""The European Council,"" it said, ""will demonstrate particular vigilance as regards safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens, the necessity to maintain ambitious level playing field conditions, and to protect fishing enterprises and coastal communities."" It emphasised in particular that a fisheries agreement that builds on ""existing reciprocal access and quota shares"" is a matter of priority. EU leaders still hope for fishing access 'Fairer share' of UK fish promised UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders The statement was a clear sign that the UK will not have things all its own way, when it comes to balancing the competing demands of access to EU markets for UK fish produce, and access to UK fishing waters for EU boats. Several EU leaders highlighted fishing as a particularly sensitive issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said talks on fisheries were ""undoubtedly going to be an area where negotiations are going to be tough"". But the bluntest warning came from the French President Emmanuel Macron, who suggested that if the UK was unwilling to compromise in negotiations on fishing, which would need to make rapid progress, then talks on a wider trade deal would be slow. ""We as 27 have a clear position on fair competition, on fish, and on the subject of the EU's regulatory autonomy, and that forms part of our position for the future relationship talks,"" he said. The president implied that without sufficient progress on trade,the backstop planto avoid a hard border in Ireland would have to be implemented, including a temporary customs union for the whole of the UK. ""It is a lever because it is in our mutual interest to have this future relationship,"" Mr Macron said. ""I can't imagine that the desire of Theresa May or her supporters is to remain for the long term in a customs union, but (instead) to define a proper future relationship that resolves this problem."" This video can not be played Disputes over fishing aren't new. This was Reality Check's take earlier this year. It is a warning that the prime minister could have done without, as she seeks to appeal to the British public for support for her deal in advance of a vote in Parliament next month. But it is also a reminder - if any were needed - that other countries have domestic political concerns that will have to be taken into account. If anything, the negotiations on the future relationship - which can only begin formally after the UK has left the EU - will be even harder than the 18 months of negotiations that produced the withdrawal agreement which has just been endorsed.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker: ""If the House [of Commons] would say no, we would have no deal"" There was a definite ""battle of the tones"" at the seal-the-deal Brexit summit with Theresa May. EU leaders were determinedly sombre, while the UK prime minister had to sound upbeat and positive about her country's Brussels-free future. It shouldn't be under-estimated. Sunday was a huge day for the EU, signing off on the divorce papers of a departing key member state for the first time in the history of the bloc. In the eyes of many, Brexit counts as an EU failure. At the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron reminded the press of the fragility of European Union. Which is why, time and again, EU leaders in Brussels continue to make so much of the (unusual) show of unity the Brexit process has provoked in EU ranks. Brexit: Where are we now? Your guide to EU jargon EU leaders agree UK's Brexit deal For now, of course, all European eyes turn to the UK to see if the hard-negotiated Brexit deal passes through the House of Commons. If it doesn't, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, insists there will be no deal. Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? Fishing after Brexit: Sink or swim? ""This is the deal. This is THE deal,"" he told me emphatically, ruling out the possibility of renegotiating the Brexit texts. If he's true to his word, and parliament votes down the divorce deal, then all 19 months of painful EU-UK negotiations were for naught. And both sides could find themselves staring at the cost and potential chaos of what the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier calls a non-orderly Brexit. EU leaders are hell-bent on avoiding that. Jean-Claude Juncker told the BBC the Brexit deal reached with Theresa May was ""THE deal"" So much so, that as much as  EU leaders regret Brexit, and as often as they have spoken at every EU summit so far since the Brexit vote about the door still being open for the UK to change its mind, there was none of that talk on Sunday. Instead, they were fully on message with Theresa May - to help her sell her deal back home. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte remarked that Mrs May had ""fought hard"" and that the result was a good deal. Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said these had been ""extraordinary"", ""complex"" and ""difficult"" negotiations, resulting in an ""unprecedented and ambitious partnership"". All that talk of fair and fabulous deals somehow rings rather hollow, though, when the EU has made clear from the start that it would never concede a deal to the UK that made life look as good - or even better - outside, rather than inside, their club. Macron's blunt Brexit warning to UK,external Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? But of course, this is not the final deal. The story of the EU and UK's tempestuous relationship is far from over. Maybe there will be a second vote on the Brexit deal in the UK parliament, or a second referendum, or a general election. Until we know, we cannot be 100%  sure how the EU will react. But if, as seems likely, Brexit does indeed go ahead, it is only then that the detailed negotiations for a future EU-UK trade deal begin in earnest. And Mr Macron reminded us all at the Sunday summit of the horse-trading, arm-twisting and conflicting national interests of EU countries that will challenge those negotiations. The French president essentially threatened the success of a future EU-UK trade deal if the UK didn't guarantee access for French fishermen to UK waters after Brexit. Fishing has been another contentious issue in the Brexit talks - and the French president has indicated he will not drop it Now this should shock no-one. Fish, Gibraltar, the EU trying to tie the UK to its competition rules, even the Irish border backstop are all issues that were dealt with just enough to complete the Brexit deal texts but, in reality, the can was kicked down the road to the future trade negotiations. To sum up: these 19 months of endless wrangling over the Brexit divorce deal... they were a just a taster of what is yet to come.

"A clash of kings: Carlsen, right, has been defending his title from Caruana Two chess grandmasters have spent November locked in stalemate, with the world chess championship up for grabs. After 12 games and 12 draws, American Fabiano Caruana is seeking to take the title from Norwegian Magnus Carlsen. After drawing their final match in London on Monday, they head to a series of fast-paced tie-breakers, culminating in a game type known as ""Armageddon"". If he wins, Caruana will be the first US world champion since Bobby Fischer in 1972. But in Wednesday's tie-breaker, he will again face a fierce title defence from Carlsen, who has been champion since 2013 and is the top-ranked player in the world. On top of the prestige that comes with the title, the pair are also battling over a â¬1m (Â£880,000) cash prize. The two players were locked in a soundproof box at the play venue for some three hours before Carlsen offered his opponent a draw. The game's moves were live-streamed with commentary from other chess grandmasters across platforms including YouTube and popular video game streaming site Twitch.tv. 'Pawnographic' World Chess logo mocked Russian politician crowned world chess head The country breeding a generation of chess whizz kids The 12-draw series in London makes it one of the most fiercely contested in history. The tie-breaker will be a series of increasingly fast games. If victorious Caruana would become the first US world champion in four decades Carlsen will be seen as the favourite as he is considered an expert at rapid chess. However, former grand master Garry Kasparov tweeted that he thought the draw offer indicated the Norwegian was losing his nerve. Allow Twitter content?

In the ordinary games, each player starts with a generous time bank of 100 minutes, and more time is added as the game progresses. That means it is possible to watch a grandmaster do nothing except stare at the board for several minutes. But in the tie-breakers, four games are played with just 25 minutes on the clock, and 10 seconds added after each move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If it is still a draw after that, two ""blitz"" games are played - with just five minutes per player and three added seconds per turn. In such circumstances, mistakes are much easier to make. In the unlikely event that after five sets of blitz, the title is still tied, a sudden death variety called ""Armageddon"" is played. In this chess game type, there will be a winner - a draw means a victory for the player wielding the black game pieces. To compensate, white gets more time on his clock - a minute more, but the pace is still as fast as a blitz game.

"InSight quickly returned its first image from Elysium Planitia The US space agency Nasa has landed a new robot on Mars after a dramatic seven-minute plunge to the surface of the Red Planet. The InSight probe,externalaims to study the world's deep interior, and make it the only planet - apart from Earth - that has been examined in this way. Confirmation of touchdown came through on cue at 19:53 GMT. It ended an anxious wait in which the robot radioed home a series of updates on its descent. Nasa's mission control at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) erupted into cheers when it became clear InSight was safe on the ground. The agency's chief administrator, James Bridenstine, celebrated what he called ""an amazing day"". President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that ""to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers."" InSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator. Before landing, Nasa had dubbed it the ""biggest parking lot on Mars"". The first picture of this landscape came back very quickly, within minutes. It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings. The image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon. A later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer. The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance Mars InSight: Beating the odds James Tuttle Keane's guide to Mars' interior Nasa robot to target ancient lake crater This video can not be played The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California Like all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair. Stage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress. It had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop. InSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent. The robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing. One of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander. It was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions. And as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars. ""Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,"" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh. The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth This will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal. The first is a package ofFranco-British seismometers,externalthat will be lifted on to the surface to listen for ""Marsquakes"". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of. A German-led ""mole"" system,externalwill burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is. Andthe third experiment will use radio transmissions,externalto very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: ""If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information."" This video can not be played Bruce Banerdt: ""Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries"" Scientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time. InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: ""The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.""

"This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world US President Donald Trump has cast doubt on a report by his own government warning of devastating effects from climate change. Asked outside the White House about the findings that unchecked global warming would wreak havoc on the US economy, he said: ""I don't believe it."" The report found that climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars annually and damage health. The Trump administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' This video can not be played President Trump: ""We're the cleanest we've ever been"" He told reporters on Monday that he had ""read some of"" Friday's report, which was compiled with help from US government agencies and departments. Mr Trump said other countries must take measures to cut their emissions. ""You're going to have to have China and Japan and all of Asia and all these other countries, you know, it [the report] addresses our country,"" he said. ""Right now we're at the cleanest we've ever been and that's very important to me. ""But if we're clean, but every other place on Earth is dirty, that's not so good.

The Fourth National Climate Assessment,externaloutlines the potential impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,"" the report says. ""Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ""to adapt to the changes that will occur"". The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked In October,President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.
