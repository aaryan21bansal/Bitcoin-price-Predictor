"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: Are supermarkets following the rules? New laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after ""significant evidence"" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said shops would have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance. It comes after customers and staff raised concerns over safety, with some workers saying they had faced abuse. Mr Drakeford said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant. Speaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said the Test, Trace, Protect scheme had shown there was ""no doubt at all"" transmission was taking place in supermarkets. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Pharmacy 'first in Wales to offer Covid jab' Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die But he also said: ""I don't want anybody to get the idea that supermarkets are dangerous places - supermarkets are safe places and we're incredibly grateful to all those brave members of staff who have been in there, providing face-to-face services to members of the public since the very beginning of the pandemic. ""We want to make sure that they are even safer."" Wales remains under a level four ""stay at home"" lockdown, meaning people are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including shopping for food. But there have been growing concerns from shoppers and staff about safety in supermarkets and Mr Drakeford previously said one-way systems and number limits in stores appeared to have broken down. Supermarkets have been told to block off aisles with 'non-essential' items Some workers have claimed they are seeing shoppers walking around without masks, not using hygiene measures and shopping in large groups. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said many shops already had safety measures in place, including providing hand sanitisers, limiting numbers in store and reminding people to socially distance. The first minister said laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people in ""many communities"" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year. Mr Drakeford said people needed to see everything was ""being done to keep them safe"" and give them the ""necessary confidence... to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown."" Under the laws, set to come into force early next week, all retailers will need to have: signs visible to help people keep their distance and make their way around the store sanitiser available for hands and trolleys systems in place to limit the number of people who can be in store at any one time These measures were already guidance, but will now be law, and supermarket owners and managers will be responsible for ensuring the new rules are followed. ""Many [shops] are already operating high standards and we need to raise the bar for those who could and should improve,"" Mr Drakeford said. Some shop workers had told BBC Wales they were facing ""daily abuse"" for challenging rule-breakers, with some threatened and spat at. The Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) has warned the onus on policing customers' behaviour must not fall on shop workers. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets While Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium said trying to enforce laws had created ""further conflict and flashpoint"" with customers, leading to workers being abused. ""We ask that all customers play their part in keeping our stores safe, shopping alone where possible, following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers,"" she said. ""We also ask that government considers legislating for better protections for shop workers, as is being planned in Scotland."" Mr Drakeford said it was ""entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic"" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions.Staff had been ""going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table"", he said. Nick Ireland, regional secretary for Usdaw for Wales and the south west of England, said shop workers were anxious about confronting customers not adhering to guidance in shops. 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries? ""We've asked for clearer signage, and robust one way systems,"" he said. ""Some shoppers seem to forget about two metre social distancing, particularly when it comes the workforce in stores."" Health spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said new rules for shops were ""overdue"". He said it was ""certainly the right thing to do"", and was ""totally unacceptable for any supermarket staff to be the subject of any abuse over this"". Meanwhile, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""quite clear that we are lagging behind other parts of the UK"" in regards to numbers of people vaccinated. ""It's important to get those vaccines out to people and get the vaccines into people's arms,"" he added. Mr Drakeford said enforcement action could be taken against supermarkets over breaches of Covid rules. During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations. ""Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,"" he said. ""They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require."" The first minister said there was also the ""wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers"". ""I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,"" Mr Drakeford added. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?

"From left: Daniel Hodges, Mike Fanone and Christina Laury Police officers who were targeted by a pro-Trump mob have been speaking out about the ""medieval battle"" that unfolded on the steps of the Capitol and inside the halls of American democracy last week. Police faced off against rioters equipped with clubs, shields, pitchforks, firearms, and metal poles stripped from seating set up for next week's inauguration. Here's what we've learned from their interviews with US media. Michael Fanone, a 40-year-old DC plainclothes narcotics detective who was told to wear his uniform that day, rushed to the West Terrace of the Capitol where he took turns holding back the crowd, and resting to rinse his face of the the chemical irritants that that crowd was spraying on police. ""We weren't battling 50 or 60 rioters in this tunnel,"" the MPD (Metropolitan Police Department of District of Columbia) veteran told theWashington Post,external. ""We were battling 15,000 people. It looked like a medieval battle scene."" After he was grabbed by his helmet and dragged face-first down several steps, he said the crowd started stripping gear from his vest, including spare ammo, his radio and his badge - all while chanting ""USA!"". Michael Fanone, a DC detective, was dragged into the crowd and beaten ""We got one! We got one!"" Mr Fanone said he heard people shout, with others chanting: ""Kill him with his own gun!"" Some members of the crowd protected him after he started yelling that he has children, the father of four toldCNN,external. He sustained only minor injuries but later found out in hospital that he had suffered a mild heart attack during the brawl. MPD Officer Daniel Hodges, 32, had already been on shift for several hours before the rioting began. ""We were battling, you know, tooth and nail for our lives,"" he toldABC News,external. In one viral video, Mr Hodges is seen pinned in a glass doorway between officers and the crowd, as rioters strip his gas mask from his face and beat him with his own police-issued baton. One rioter tried to gouge his eyes. ""That was one of the three times that day where I thought: Well, this might be it,"" said Mr Hodges. ""This might be the end for me."" As he choked on tear gas, he is seen on video gasping for air to call out for help. Enough police were eventually able to push through the melee to extract him. ""I had conspiracy theorists and everyone you could think of yelling at me, saying, 'Why are you doing this, you're the traitor,'""  Mr Hodges toldradio station WAMU,external. ""We're not the traitors. We're the ones who saved Congress that day, and we'll do it as many times as necessary."" Despite fearing for his life, Mr Hodges says he decided not to use his gun on the crowd. ""I didn't want to be the guy who starts shooting, because I knew they had guns - we had been seizing guns all day,"" he told the Post. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Robert Glover, the commander on scene for MPD, declared a riot at 13:50 local time, nearly two hours after Trump's speech at the White House where he instructed his followers to go to the Capitol. He quickly told officers to retake the inauguration bleachers, to stop the crowd from raining down heavy objects on officers from above. Mr Glover told the Post that some rioters may have been caught up in the moment, but others seemed to be moving in ""military formation"" as if they had prepared for the assault. He said that some appeared to be using hand signals to co-ordinate tactics. Several US military veterans, as well as off-duty police officers from Virginia, Maryland and Texas, have since been suspended or arrested for participating in the riot. MPD Officer Christina Laury, 32, was among the first city police officers to arrive on the scene. When she got to the Capitol, officers were already being brutally attacked by rioters attempting to storm the building. ""They had bear mace, which is literally used for bears. I got hit with it plenty of times that day and it just seals your eyes shut. You just would see officers going down trying to douse themselves with water, trying to open their eyes up so they can see again."" ""The bravery and the heroism that I saw in these officers - the second they were able to open their eyes, they were back up front and they were just trying to stop these individuals from coming in."" One officer being lauded as a hero has yet to speak about his experience -Officer Eugene Goodman, a member of Congress' 2,100 member Capitol Police force. Mr Goodman, an African American Iraq War veteran, was seen singlehandedly distracting a rampaging mob, giving lawmakers enough time to clear the chamber and get to safety. The Capitol officer hailed as a 'hero' On Thursday, a cross-party group of lawmakers introduced a bill calling for him to receive the Congressional Gold Medal for his effort to defend democracy. The Capitol Police have been criticised over their response and preparation. Several top Capitol security officials, including the Capitol Police chief and the sergeants-at-arms for the House and Senate, resigned in the wake of the siege amid claims from lawmakers that they had not done enough to prepare for the mob. Protesters climbed the bleachers that were erected for Biden's inauguration On Friday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced General Russel HonorÃ© would be leading an immediate investigation of the Capitol's security infrastructure. Video footage has also emerged showing an officer taking a selfie with a rioter inside the Capitol. Some officers reportedly gave directions to rioters telling them how to get to the offices of Democratic lawmakers. Several Capitol Police officers have been suspended for allegedly violating policies as the agency conducts an internal probe. How a Trump rally turned deadly at the Capitol.

"Tennis players have been flown in to the country on charter flights by tournament organisers The sight of some of the world's biggest tennis stars touching down for the forthcoming Australian Open has frustrated many Australians unable to return home because of the pandemic. Australia currently has a weekly cap on the number of international arrivals, with people having to undergo quarantine in a designated facility. There are roughly 37,000 Australians waiting to return, ABC News reports. A number of airlines have suspended routes making it harder to travel back. On Friday, Emirates airline announced it would be stopping its flights to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Meanwhile, organisers of the Australian Open have been putting on chartered flights for the players and other members of staff. Players had to test negative before boarding flights and were then placed in designated Australian Open quarantine hotels in Melbourne and Adelaide. They are, however, allowed out of their rooms for up to five hours a day to practise on court. But47 players who were on flights where passengers later tested positivewill now have to be confined to their rooms for two weeks. The first of these groups, on a flight from Los Angeles, reportedly includes two-time champion Victoria Azarenka and former US Open champion Sloane Stephens. Tennys Sandgren, who tested positive but wascleared to fly by organisers after his medical file was reviewed,is also believed to have been on the flight. A second group of 23 players on a flight from United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi suffered the same fate. Both flights arrived on Friday. Those players will have less than 10 days to practise before the tournament starts on 8 February. Reports say they will have gym equipment delivered to their rooms. UK player Johanna Konta, who was not on either of the affected flights, tweeted about workouts in her hotel room to encourage fitness in confined spaces. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile former tennis world number oneAndy Murray has been unable to fly out to Australiaafter the Briton tested positive for coronavirus. The arrival of the tennis players, while so many Australians are still trying to return home, has drawn criticism. ""I can't comprehend the fact that one week they announce they're halving the caps for citizens and the following week they announce they've found 1,200 spaces for tennis players and support staff,"" Sarah, a key worker who lives in London but is from Sydney, told the BBC. She has been trying to return to Sydney since October and her most recent flight was cancelled. ""All I want to do is return home. I've had to watch my sister's wedding on Zoom. My flight was timed so I get out of quarantine in time for her baby shower but it looks like I'll miss this and the birth"". More than 1,200 people have been brought to Australia for the tennis tournament On Saturday, the Australian government said it would arrange for a further 20 international repatriation flights to bring its stranded nationals home from ""priority areas"". Those returning would not be counted within the existing traveller caps, a minister confirmed. The Australians who are trapped in the UK 'Crushed' on Melbourne's path to Covid success Dr Alyse Brown is currently based in Cambridge in the UK and has flights booked to Sydney next month. She has been trying to raise awareness about the issue. ""While the Australians back home watch the tennis, I'll be reading on support pages the daily horror stories of stranded Australians entering into homelessness,"" she told the BBC, speaking before the latest announcement on flights from the government. ""It has always been apparent to us that Australia has means to get their people home, they just lack the political will to do so and this makes me unspeakably mad. It's heartless economic decision making and the tennis for us is just another group of people we see the government prioritised above us."" People have taken to Twitter using the hashtag #strandedaussies to share their views. One user said: ""Thousands of Australian citizens are still stranded overseas. I've been a huge tennis fan for close to 40 years, but this is just wrong. I will not be supporting this Australian summer of tennis."" Earlier this week, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said that if Melbourne cancelled the tournament, itwould be picked up by another country,external. Australia has strict limits on the number of arrivals allowed to enter the country. Authorities say this is to ensure there is enough room in a government quarantine facility. Unlike other countries, those arriving in Australia must quarantine in a designated facility or hotel instead of their own homes. The cap on people entering was cut further last week after a hotel worker in Queensland contracted the UK variant of the coronavirus. Until 15 February, New South Wales will have a weekly cap of 1,505 arrivals, Western Australia will permit 512 people and Queensland will have a cap of 500. Victoria and South Australia have kept their caps the same. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territorieshad their own ""bespoke arrangements"" for those arriving,external. The Australian government has operated a number of repatriation flights but demand has been high. Last month, in an interview on the Seven TV network, Mr Morrison said Australians overseas were his ""first priority in terms of people coming back into the country,external"". ""We want you to come home and you have every right to come home,"" he said.

"Exam results are likely to appear before the end of the summer term Exam results for A-levels and GCSEs in England could be published in early July this year, according to proposals for replacing cancelled exams. A consultation launched by the exams watchdog and the Department for Education confirmed that grades will be decided by teacher assessment. But results this summer are likely to be released much earlier than usual. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said pupils would receive ""a grade that reflects their ability"". There are also likely to be written test papers set by exam boards, but marked by teachers, with some later checks if there are concerns about fairness. For vocational qualifications, exams which use mostly written papers are also likely to use teachers' grades - but qualifications which need a test of practical, hands-on skills will have separate arrangements. Ofqual and the Department for Education have formally launched a two-week consultation on a system for how results will be decided, after disruption from the pandemic forced the cancellation of exams. This is the second year of exam results being disrupted by the pandemic For A-levels and GCSEs this could see the scrapping of the traditional results days in August, with a proposal to publish the results in ""early July"", increasing the time for appeals and adding more time before the start of the university term. Last year the process of replacement results ended with U-turns and confusion, as an algorithm initially used for deciding grades was abandoned and teachers' assessments used instead. Pupils could take mini-exams for cancelled A-levels and GCSEs Teachers' grades will be used for cancelled 2021 exams Confusion as some BTec students continue with exams Private school IGCSE exams still going ahead in summer This time there will be no algorithm, but from the outset the process will rely on the judgement of teachers, who will be asked to use evidence such as coursework, essays, homework and mock exams. There are also proposals for test papers, or mini-exams, which would be set by examiners but which would be likely to be marked within schools by teachers. Teachers provide replacement grades for A-levels and GCSEs Evidence could include coursework, essays, tests and homework External tests set by exam boards, but likely to be marked in school Results early July Vocational exams will use teachers' grades, but separate arrangements for practical skills Two-week consultation before any final decision These would inform teachers' decisions rather than be a fixed proportion of the final grade - and could be used as evidence for any scrutiny of the reliability of a school's results or if there were appeals over grades. There is also a recognition they might have to be taken by some pupils at home. But it has still to be decided whether it would be mandatory to take these exams, and whether there would be a single paper per subject or the option to take more. The Department for Education has said pupils will not face tests in subject areas they have not covered. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the proposals seemed ""sensible"". But he said the written tests would have to be ""exceptionally well designed"" to make them fair between students ""whose learning has been disrupted by the pandemic to greatly varying extents"". ""There are still many questions left unanswered,"" said the National Education Union's co-leader Kevin Courtney, about how tests could be flexible enough and how appeals will be decided. There will be a process of training teachers in how the grading system will operate and be consistent between different schools. For vocational qualifications, the proposals say those closer to written A-level and GCSE exams will be graded in a similar way to the academic exams, using teacher assessment to replace written papers. There will be different approaches for qualifications requiring proof of practical skills, but there will be arrangements to make this possible. Some BTec exams have already gone ahead this month and IGCSE exams are still planned to continue this summer. A-levels and GCSEs have been cancelled in Wales and Northern Ireland, and in Scotland the Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers have also been scrapped. England's Education Secretary, Mr Williamson, said: ""Fairness to young people has been and will continue to be fundamental to every decision we take on these issues.""

"This video can not be played The pharmacy in Gwynedd is offering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab A pharmacy has become the first in Wales to offer Covid jabs, as community vaccine trials begin. Fifty people with appointments are to visit the pharmacy near Pwllheli, Gwynedd, on Friday to receive their first shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The pilot has begun in pharmacies in Betsi Cadwaladr health board. First Minister Mark Drakeford said community pharmacists can help with vaccinations ""in more than one way"". It follows a letter from Community Pharmacy Wales to Wales' health minister which saidthere was an ""urgent need"" to use pharmacies in Wales to help roll out coronavirus vaccines. UK Government figures show 126,375 people in Wales, 4% of the population, have received their first coronavirus jab so far. That compares with 4.1% (224,840) in Scotland, 4.9% in England (2,769,164) and 6% (114,567) in Northern Ireland. Hundreds more pharmacies in Wales will offer the jab in the next two weeks. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Q&A: When will I get my Covid vaccine? All over-50s in Wales to be offered Covid jab by spring Rosie Bennett, one of the patients to receive a vaccination at Fferyllwyr H L Taylor Pharmacy in Llanbedrog, said getting her vaccine was a ""small step to a better future"". The 82-year-old said: ""I don't have a car, so it was a huge relief to know that I wouldn't have to travel a long distance to have the vaccine. ""Here in the village, we know the staff at the chemists. They've been doing a great job during the pandemic and it's reassuring to have the vaccine from someone you know."" Steffan John, the pharmacist who administered the vaccine to Rosie, said the staff are ""really pleased to do their bit for the community"". Pharmacist Llyr Hughes, who runs four pharmacies, including Fferyllwyr H L Taylor Pharmacy, said ""vaccinating at scale"" was the ""only way out of the pandemic"". Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Hughes said he expected the rollout to happen ""very quickly across all community pharmacies in Wales"". ""I don't forsee any big problems,"" he said. ""Community pharmacists have a wealth of experience in delivering flu vaccinations. ""We will tailor our work model to accommodate for this, as we did for the flu vaccine."" Mr Hughes said his pharmacy will have vaccinated in the region of more than 100 people by Saturday afternoon. He added: ""If we can deliver locally we can provide easier access to older patients."" He explained local patients would be contacted about an appointment for the vaccine at the pharmacy. Mr John said that the vaccine comes in vials of ten doses which means it's ""important to vaccinate that many people at a time and not to waste any"". Llyr Hughes who runs Fferyllwyr H L Taylor Pharmacy said 50 patients will be vaccinated today However, Mr Drakeford told Friday's Welsh Government press briefing that not all pharmacy premises would be suitable to deliver the Covid vaccines. He said some community pharmacists could be asked to administer vaccinations at mass vaccination centres instead, in cases where spaces for vaccinations are small at pharmacies with high volumes of people. Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout was still in the ""early stages"" of the ""largest vaccination programme Wales has ever seen"". ""People can be expected to be asked to attend either a mass or community centre, hospital, GP practice, pharmacy or mobile unit,"" he added. Mr Gething said a mix of vaccination sites and centres were chosen so ""everyone across the country has equal access to a vaccination"". He added that people will be notified for an appointment, and before that they should not call GPs or health services to request a vaccine and ""add undue pressure"" to their workloads. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said Wales' vaccination programme was ""improving far, far too slowly"". ""As important as it is that we have one pharmacy doing it, what's happening in all the others?"" Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was clear Wales was ""lagging behind"" the rest of the UK on delivering the vaccinations. ""It's certainly not happening quickly enough, we need to see the Welsh Government stepping up to the plate,"" he said. The Welsh Government has said more pharmacists and other primary care services, such as dentists and opticians - are being invited to help with the rollout, subject to vaccine supply.

"Police said Graeme Perks had gone to investigate the sound of breaking glass when he was stabbed Plastic surgeons have expressed shock at the stabbing of ""one of the most highly regarded and respected surgeons"" in their profession. Graeme Perks, 65, was stabbed in his abdomen and chest during a break-in at his house in Halam, a village near Southwell in Nottinghamshire. Police said the attack on Thursday morning had left him ""fighting for his life"" and left his family, who were upstairs at the time, ""extremely upset"". They have arrested a 55-year-old man. Graeme Perks has been described as ""one of the most highly regarded and respected surgeons in the profession"" Mr Perks previously served as president of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS). Current president Ruth Waters said BAPRAS had been contacted by colleagues all around the world as news of the attack spread. ""All have expressed their shock at what has happened and also their deep concern for his wellbeing and their hope for his speedy recovery,"" she said. ""It has been my good fortune and honour to know Graeme for many years. I have benefited from his kindness, generosity and extensive knowledge throughout my career in plastic surgery."" BAPRAS described him as ""one of the most highly regarded and respected surgeons in the profession"". As well as being a leading plastic surgeon, Mr Perks and his wife have raised thousands of pounds for charity by opening their garden to visitors.

"Men who had already had the virus were asked to donate blood plasma for the trial A potential treatment for Covid using blood plasma does not reduce deaths among hospital patients, trials show. The results are a blow to researchers and the NHS, which led the drive to collect plasma donations. This arm of theRecovery trial,external, which is investigating a number of promising Covid treatments, has now been closed. The Oxford researchers involved say they are ""incredibly grateful"" for the contribution of patients across the country. Donations of plasma were temporarily suspended, according to NHS Blood and Transplant.** There had been huge international interest in the role of convalescent plasma as a possible treatment for hospital patients with Covid-19. The treatment involves blood plasma being taken from people who have recovered from the disease - which contains antibodies to coronavirus - and transfused into seriously ill patients. It was hoped the plasma donation would give the recipient's struggling immune system a boost to fight off Covid. The NHS had been urging people to donate, particularly men who are thought to have higher levels of antibodies in their blood. But early analysis of 1,873 deaths in a study of 10,400 UK patients shows the treatment made ""no significant difference"". In the group treated with convalescent plasma, 18% of patients died within 28 days - the same figure for the group given standard treatment. Patients in the study are still being followed up and the final results will be published shortly. Earlier this week, a separate study showed no evidence that the same treatment improved outcomes for patients in intensive care. Martin Landray, chief investigator and professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the Recovery trial showed ""the value of large randomised trials to properly assess the role of potential treatments"". The trial is still investigating other treatments, including tocilizumab, aspirin and an antibody cocktail. Prof Peter Horby, who also worked on the trial, said the largest ever trial of convalescent plasma ""was only possible thanks to the generous donation of plasma by recovered patients and the willingness of current patients to contribute to advancing medical care"". ""While the overall result is negative, we need to await the full results before we can understand whether convalescent plasma has any role in particular patient sub-groups,"" he said. **NHS Blood and Transplant restarted donations of blood plasma,externalon 20 January. They could be used to see whether particular groups of patients, such as those with low antibody levels, could benefit. International trials are also testing if plasma helps people when it's used much earlier in the disease, before people get to hospital. Which treatments work best against Covid?

"Scottish fishermen have resorted to sailing to Denmark to land their catch as Brexit red tape continues to delay exports, an industry body has said. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, which campaigned to leave the EU, also said the Brexit trade deal was the worst of both worlds for the industry. Many fishermen ""now fear for their future"", it said. The UK government said the deal would ""bring immediate gains to our fishermen and women across the whole UK"". Late last year, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) said it was ""deeply aggrieved"" by the Brexit deal. Fishing firms have alsowarned of impending bankruptcyas delays continue at ports following the introduction of post-Brexit regulations. On Friday, the SFF kept up the pressure on the UK government. Ina letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson,external, it said some fishermen ""are now making a 72-hour round trip to land fish in Denmark, as the only way to guarantee that their catch will make a fair price and actually find its way to market while still fresh enough to meet customer demands"". Quotas are used by many countries to manage shared fish stocks. They determine how many fish of each species each country's fleets are allowed to catch. Scottish fishing industry 'deeply aggrieved' by Brexit deal Brexit trade deal: Who really owns UK fishing quotas? The SFF said that Brexit quota gains ""can hardly be claimed as a resounding success"" and that the Brexit deal ""actually leaves the Scottish industry in a worse position on more than half of the key stocks"". ""This industry now finds itself in the worst of both worlds,"" said SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald, accusing Prime Minister Boris Johnson of broken promises on quotas. The ""desperately poor deal"" reached on quotas, under which the EU ""have full access to our waters"" means that the UK has ""no ability to leverage more fish from the EU"", she said. ""This, coupled with the chaos experienced since 1 January in getting fish to market, means that many in our industry now fear for their future, rather than look forward to it with optimism and ambition,"" Ms Macdonald added. The Scottish National Party said the letter was ""an utterly devastating verdict on Brexit from Scotland's fishing industry"". An SNP spokesperson said the Scottish fishing industry was ""right to be angry"" about the Brexit deal, which it said was costing Scotland's fishing communities millions of pounds. The spokesman called on the prime minister to deliver ""a multi-billion pound package of Brexit compensation for Scotland"", adding: ""Communities across Scotland will never forgive the Tories for the damage they are doing to our country with their extreme Brexit obsession."" A UK government spokesperson said the Prime Minister would respond to the SFF letter in due course. The spokesperson said: ""We have now taken back control of our waters and the agreement we have reached with the EU secures a 25% transfer of quota from EU to UK vessels over five years, starting with 15% this year."" The spokesperson said the government was looking at providing additional financial support for the Scottish fishing industry, which it recognised was facing ""some temporary issues"". ""The Prime Minister has already committed to investing Â£100m in the UK's fishing industry and provided the Scottish government with nearly Â£200m to minimise disruption for businesses,"" the spokesperson added.

"Signal is a free, encrypted messenger service - and a rival to WhatsApp and Telegram Messaging platform Signal says it has resolved technical problems which have hampered its service over the past few days, after seeing a rush of new users. On Friday, some users reported messages failing to send on both the mobile and desktop apps for several hours. The company has seen a huge uptick in interest since its rival WhatsApp unveiled new privacy terms last week. It urged users to continue with the service and report any further problems. In a series of tweets,it said users might see errors in some of their chats,external, including missed messages, but this would not affect their security. ""Signal is back!"" it said. ""Like an underdog going through a training montage, we've learned a lot since yesterday - and we did it together. ""Thanks to the millions of new Signal users around the world for your patience."" Both Signal and Telegram, another free-to-use encrypted messaging app, have benefited from discontent sparked by WhatsApp's updated terms and conditions. The update led many users to believe WhatsApp was telling them that they must allow it to share data with its parent company Facebook if they wished to continue using it. However the platform now says this practice is not new, and there are no changes to it. There are also different privacy laws for users in the UK and Europe - but the notification was sent to everyone. WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe WhatsApp said there had been ""confusion"" about its message, which initially gave people until 8 February to accept its updated terms or stop using the service. WhatsApp has now changed the cut-off date to 15 May, saying it would use the time to clear up misinformation. ""We can't see your private messages or hear your calls, and neither can Facebook,""WhatsApp said in an earlier FAQ blog post,external. According to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, Signal was downloaded 246,000 times worldwide in the week before WhatsApp announced the change on 4 January, and 8.8 million times the week after. In India, downloads went from 12,000 to 2.7 million. In the UK, they leapt from 7,400 to 191,000, and in the US from 63,000 to 1.1 million. On Wednesday, Telegram said it had surpassed 500 million active users globally. Downloads jumped from 6.5 million in the week starting 28 December, to 11 million during the following week. During the same period, WhatsApp's global downloads shrank from 11.3 million to 9.2 million. WhatsApp has said the data it shares from users outside the EU and UK does not include messages, groups or call logs. However, it does include: phone number and other information provided on registration (such as name) information about the user's phone, including make, model, and mobile company internet protocol (IP) addresses, which indicate the location of a user's internet connections any payments and financial transactions made over WhatsApp WhatsApp extends 'confusing' update deadline WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The UK's epidemic is still officially estimated to be growing, according to the latest R number, but data suggests new cases are beginning to fall. The R number - which takes into account cases, hospitalisations and deaths - is estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.3, compared with 1 and 1.4 last week. This suggests the total number of people with the virus is still rising across the UK. But in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower. In the capital, the estimate - based on data up until 11 January - is between 0.9 and 1.2, compared with 1.1 and 1.4 the previous week. It comes as a further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291. The latest government figures on Friday,externalalso showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported. Meanwhile, more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - latest figures show the number at 3,234,946. What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? Covid patients moved from London to Newcastle North-east England leads over-80s vaccination race Although the number of people sick with coronavirus is growing in the UK, data from various sources suggests new infections are declining. This provides early signs that lockdown restrictions may be taking effect. The government's scientific advisory group Sage, which calculates the R number, said areas that have been under tougher restrictions for a longer period of time - including east of England, London, and the south east - are showing ""a slight decline in the number of people infected"". However, they warned that regions such as north-west and south-west England continue to see infections rise, where the spread of the new UK variant may be playing a role. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. In theory, it describes the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus onto, on average. In reality, though, the government's estimate of R gives a wider view of the epidemic's general trend since it also looks at what is happening in hospitals. Cases, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 have been alarmingly high since the beginning of the year and the latest estimate of the R number indicates that the pandemic is continuing to grow. But because of the way the data to estimate R is collected - it reflects the situation a week ago. More up to date indicators suggest that there's a slight decline in infections in the east of England, London, and the South East. These areas have had the highest prevalence and therefore the toughest restrictions the longest but infections are continuing to rise in the North West and South West probably because of the spread of the new variant of the virus. Despite this there's some relief at these figures among the government's scientific advisors.  They were not sure whether the current restrictions would be enough to prevent the more contagious variant getting out of control. Now they expect Covid-related deaths to level off in a week or so and then decline as the benefits of the vaccine programme begin to take effect. Cases should also begin to decrease in the coming weeks. But all this depends on people continuing to observe the government's social distancing guidelines - and come into contact with others only if it is essential. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said coronavirus deaths were likely to peak in the next week to 10 days. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that the lockdown measures were having an impact, with the peak in infections having passed ""a good few days ago"" which would lead to a reduction in the numbers dying from the disease. ""They are likely to level off in a week - 10 days maybe - at a peak which is probably going to be bigger than the first wave peak of 1,000-a-day, but then should decline due the reductions in cases that we are seeing and, of course, the vaccine programme."" Data from the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app gives its own estimate of 0.9 for the virus's R or reproduction number. This is based on cases alone, rather than a wider number of data sources included in the official estimate. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? While this leaves out the fact that hospitals are still filling up, looking at cases on their own allows assessment of whether lockdown restrictions are working. But the large number of infections recorded at the end of December and the beginning of January means, despite receding cases, hospitalisations and deaths will inevitably continue to rise for some time. Meanwhile, a ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UK came into force on Friday as a result of a new, potentially more infectious strain linked to Brazil. Prof Wendy Barclay, a scientist at Imperial College London advising the government, saidthis ""variant of concern"" had not been detected in the UKbut another variant from Brazil was already in circulation. It is not clear whether this second strain is more contagious or not.

"Police investigations have been compromised by an error that led to hundreds of thousands of records being deleted from UK-wide databases, according to a letter seen by the BBC. The National Police Chiefs' Council said 213,000 records were deleted - more than the 150,000first reported,external. This resulted in a couple of ""near misses"" for serious crimes when trying to identify an offender, it said. The Home Office has said it isassessing the impactof the mistake. Data including fingerprint, DNA, and arrest histories was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion. The PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. The Home Office said the lost entries related to people who were arrested and then released without further action. Technical issue sees '150,000 police records lost' What does Brexit mean for security in the UK? But the letter from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says officers are aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation. It says that some of the records had been marked for indefinite retention following earlier convictions for serious offences. And it reveals that a ""weeding system"", developed and deployed by a Home Office PNC team, started to delete records wrongly last November. The process was only brought to a halt at the start of this week. The letter was sent on Friday afternoon by Deputy Chief Constable Naveed Malik of the NPCC to chief constables and police and crime commissioners. The deletion of the records has been blamed on a coding error. This resulted in records that had been flagged for deletion being lost from the database before checks had been carried out to determine whether they could be lawfully held or not. Policing minister Kit Malthouse said the problem had been identified and the process corrected so ""it cannot happen again"". He said the Home Office, National Police Chiefs' Council and other law enforcement partners were working ""at pace"" to recover the data. The Home Office said no records of criminal or dangerous persons had been deleted. But Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he described the situation as ""extraordinarily serious"", adding: ""Priti Patel will be responsible for criminals walking free. We're not going to be able to link suspects to crime scenes without the DNA and fingerprint evidence."" A home office source said the accusation was ""scaremongering and irresponsible"". Former Cumbria Police Chief Constable Stuart Hyde told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday the ""very large"" loss of arrest records presented a ""risk to public safety"". The records are linked to police investigations that were terminated before charge (No Further Action or NFA cases) or to those where an individual had been acquitted at court. It is not yet known how many records of each type were lost and full extent of deletions is still being investigated. A minister is expected to update the House of Commons on Monday. It comes after about 40,000 alerts relating to European criminals were removed from the PNC following the UK's post-Brexit security deal with the EU.

"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi died in 2012 but his family pursued the posthumous appeal Scottish judges have rejected a third appeal on behalf of the Libyan man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. The family of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who died in 2012, argued that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. But the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the verdict of the original trial, which took place at special Scottish court in the Netherlands in 2001. Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted over the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988. All 259 passengers and crew on board the flight were killed, along with 11 people in Lockerbie who died when the wreckage fell onto their homes. Lockerbie: Two routes to justice Lockerbie - The town scarred by Pan Am flight 103 Lockerbie judges 'entitled' to infer Megrahi role Last month the US announcednew charges against a Libyan man who is accused of making the bomb. Abu Agila Mohammad Masud has been charged with terrorism-related crimes, and prosecutors say they will seek his extradition to stand trial in the US. Megrahi was found guilty of playing a central role in the bombing in 2001 after the trial at Camp Zeist, and lost the first appeal against his conviction the following year. He abandoned a second appeal shortly before he was released from prison in 2009 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned to Libya, where he died in 2012. His family continued their efforts to ensure a further appeal against his conviction, and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commissionreferred his the case back to the courtslast year. A written judgment rejecting the appeal,externalwas delivered by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Carloway, the Lord Justice General. He said they had rejected the argument that the trial court had come to a verdict that no reasonable court could have reached. ""On the evidence at trial, a reasonable jury, properly directed, would have been entitled to return a guilty verdict,"" the judgement says. The five judges also rejected the second grounds of appeal, that the Crown failed to disclose material which would have created a real prospect of a different verdict. Lawyer Aamer Anwar said Megrahi's family were determined to fight for justice In a statement issued by lawyer Aamer Anwar, the family said they were ""heartbroken"" by the decision and would now lodge an appeal with the UK Supreme Court. He said Megrahi's son, Ali Al-Megrahi, maintained his father's innocence and was determined to clear his name. ""All the Megrahi family want for Scotland is peace and justice, but as Ali stated today their journey is not over. ""Libya has suffered enough, as has the family for the crime of Lockerbie. They remain determined to fight for justice,"" said Mr Anwar. Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the bombing, said he had believed the Scottish system would deliver ""truth and justice"" - but did not think it had done so. Kara Weipz said she was pleased with the decision to refuse the appeal ""I very much regret that we have to see whether we can go elsewhere to look for those outcomes,"" he said. However Kara Weipz, whose brother Richard Monetti was killed in the atrocity, said she was ""quite pleased"" with the decision. ""We have always had confidence in the system that it would turn out this way,"" she said. ""I don't know how many more decisions can be made that say the conviction at trial was the correct decision. ""I don't know how many more judges can confirm what was decided at Camp Zeist."" Megrahi's trial took place at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government had always been clear that the courts were the only ""appropriate forum"" to determine Megrahi's guilt or innocence. He said it did not comment or intervene in any criminal case and added that the investigation into the bombing remained ongoing. Police Scotland's Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said his thoughts remained with the families of the victims. He said the force would continue to work on its investigation along with the Crown Office, American law enforcement and other international partners. That commitment was reiterated by Scotland's top prosecutor, Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC. A total of 270 people died in the Lockerbie bombing The appeal against Megrahi's conviction was heard by five judges at the High Court in Edinburgh in November. Advocate depute Ronald Clancy, representing the Crown, said the original trial judges had been fully entitled to infer that Megrahi was involved in the bombing. He said a number of factors suggested his involvement, including his use of a false passport. Claire Mitchell QC, representing the Megrahi family, argued that evidence in relation to his identification was of ""poor quality"". She said the court had read into a mass of conflicting evidence a conclusion which was not justified. Megrahi was released from prison in 2009 on compassionate grounds US and British investigators indicted Megrahi in 1991 but he was not handed over by the Libyans until April 1999. May 2000- A special trial under Scots law starts on neutral ground at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. 31 January 2001- Former Libyan intelligence officer Megrahi is found guilty of mass murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 27 years. March 2002- Megrahi loses an appeal against his conviction. June 2007- The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) recommends that Megrahi is granted a second appeal against his conviction. 18 August 2009- Megrahi's move to drop his second appeal is accepted by judges at the High Court in Edinburgh. 20 August 2009- Megrahi, who has terminal prostate cancer,is released from prison on compassionate grounds,external. May 2012- Megrahi dies at his home in Tripoli, aged 60. July 2017- Megrahi's familylaunch a new bid to appeal against his conviction.

"A 24m section of the bridge parapet collapsed one mile from where a fatal crash took place Part of a rail bridge has collapsed near the site of the fatal Stonehaven train derailment. A 24m (79ft) section of the side wall has fallen from the bridge, about a mile north of where three people died when a train left the track and crashed last August. Network Rail said it was a ""structural fault"" and not caused by a landslip. The line between Aberdeen and Dundee remains closed while structural engineers assess the fault. The structure is located three miles north of Carmont signal box. The collapse was discovered just before 10:00 on Friday. The rail company said the damage to the parapet was ""extensive"" and that the line was expected to be closed for a ""significant"" period of time while repairs to the bridge take place.

"This video can not be played UK weather: Will it snow where you are? Snow and ice weather warnings are in place for much of England and Scotland after widespread recent snowfall. The Met Office has issuedyellow weather warnings,externalacross England and Scotland for Saturday and warned of possible travel disruption. Parts of England and Scotland could see as much as 5-10cm of snow in higher areas, the weather service said. It comes ashundreds of schools remain closedafter heavy snow hit the north of England on Thursday. A snow warning is in place for south-east England, including London, the east of England and the East Midlands. The Met Office said East Anglia and parts of Kent and Sussex are most at risk of snow. In pictures: Winter scenes from around the UK Some 1-3 cm of snow may fall fairly widely over these areas, with 5-10 cm possible in places, mostly over parts of East Anglia and any higher ground. A snow and ice warning is in place for most of Scotland, north-west and north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands and parts of the West Midlands. Snow is likely to fall to low levels over east Scotland and northern England. The Met Office said 1-3 cm is possible at low levels in these areas but is more likely at higher elevations, where 5-10 cm of snow is possible above 200m - and even 20cm at the highest places. Fog is also forecast for parts of the Midlands and the North, along with mist around Glasgow which may pose hazards for motorists. Heavy snow hits ambulance and vaccine services In pictures: Snowy scenes across Yorkshire Ice warnings following day of heavy snow Police forces in Yorkshire have urged people to stay at home unless their travel is essential Two girls took their sledge to a golf course near Penicuik, Midlothian The coronavirus vaccine rollout has been affected by the weather. Over-80s who were due to receive their jab at Newcastle's Centre for Life were told they could re-book rather than risk making a trip in the icy conditions. Newcastle Hospitals tweeted: ""There's enough vaccine for everyone, so don't worry about making a trip to Newcastle."" And Leeds University has delayed the opening of its asymptomatic Covid-19 test centre. Heavy snowfall has already caused travel disruption across sections of northern England and Scotland. Temperatures were as low as -6C on Friday morning in parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria, with yellow warnings set to last through most of Friday. There was a loss of gas supply to approximately 700 homes in the Hebden Bridge area after water got into the local gas network and froze. The Met Office has published advice from the Department for Transport advising people to clear snow and ice from footpaths outside their homes, preferably in the morning. ""You can then cover the path with salt before nightfall to stop it refreezing overnight,"" the advice says. Temperatures in the Greater London area are expected to drop to 1C on Friday and parts of the South East could fall to -2C. It comes after ""hazardous"" conditions on Thursday causedproblems for the ambulance service in Yorkshire, which struggled to keep up with the high demand, whileCovid vaccinations were also affected. Mark Millins, of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said the bad weather was having a ""severe impact"" on its operations and urged people to ""take extra care"" when out walking or driving. In Scotland, heavy snow in some areasresulted in road closures. The deepest snow on Thursday was in Bingley, West Yorkshire, and Strathallan in Perth, Scotland, both of which recorded 11cm.

"Police said Graeme Perks had gone to investigate the sound of breaking glass when he was stabbed Plastic surgeons have expressed shock at the stabbing of ""one of the most highly regarded and respected surgeons"" in their profession. Graeme Perks, 65, was stabbed in his abdomen and chest during a break-in at his house in Halam, a village near Southwell in Nottinghamshire.

"Exam results are likely to appear before the end of the summer term Exam results for A-levels and GCSEs in England could be published in early July this year, according to proposals for replacing cancelled exams. A consultation launched by the exams watchdog and the Department for Education confirmed that grades will be decided by teacher assessment. But results this summer are likely to be released much earlier than usual. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said pupils would receive ""a grade that reflects their ability"". There are also likely to be written test papers set by exam boards, but marked by teachers, with some later checks if there are concerns about fairness. For vocational qualifications, exams which use mostly written papers are also likely to use teachers' grades - but qualifications which need a test of practical, hands-on skills will have separate arrangements. Ofqual and the Department for Education have formally launched a two-week consultation on a system for how results will be decided, after disruption from the pandemic forced the cancellation of exams. This is the second year of exam results being disrupted by the pandemic For A-levels and GCSEs this could see the scrapping of the traditional results days in August, with a proposal to publish the results in ""early July"", increasing the time for appeals and adding more time before the start of the university term. Last year the process of replacement results ended with U-turns and confusion, as an algorithm initially used for deciding grades was abandoned and teachers' assessments used instead. Pupils could take mini-exams for cancelled A-levels and GCSEs Teachers' grades will be used for cancelled 2021 exams Confusion as some BTec students continue with exams Private school IGCSE exams still going ahead in summer This time there will be no algorithm, but from the outset the process will rely on the judgement of teachers, who will be asked to use evidence such as coursework, essays, homework and mock exams. There are also proposals for test papers, or mini-exams, which would be set by examiners but which would be likely to be marked within schools by teachers. Teachers provide replacement grades for A-levels and GCSEs Evidence could include coursework, essays, tests and homework External tests set by exam boards, but likely to be marked in school Results early July Vocational exams will use teachers' grades, but separate arrangements for practical skills Two-week consultation before any final decision These would inform teachers' decisions rather than be a fixed proportion of the final grade - and could be used as evidence for any scrutiny of the reliability of a school's results or if there were appeals over grades. There is also a recognition they might have to be taken by some pupils at home. But it has still to be decided whether it would be mandatory to take these exams, and whether there would be a single paper per subject or the option to take more. The Department for Education has said pupils will not face tests in subject areas they have not covered. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the proposals seemed ""sensible"". But he said the written tests would have to be ""exceptionally well designed"" to make them fair between students ""whose learning has been disrupted by the pandemic to greatly varying extents"". ""There are still many questions left unanswered,"" said the National Education Union's co-leader Kevin Courtney, about how tests could be flexible enough and how appeals will be decided. There will be a process of training teachers in how the grading system will operate and be consistent between different schools. For vocational qualifications, the proposals say those closer to written A-level and GCSE exams will be graded in a similar way to the academic exams, using teacher assessment to replace written papers. There will be different approaches for qualifications requiring proof of practical skills, but there will be arrangements to make this possible. Some BTec exams have already gone ahead this month and IGCSE exams are still planned to continue this summer. A-levels and GCSEs have been cancelled in Wales and Northern Ireland, and in Scotland the Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers have also been scrapped. England's Education Secretary, Mr Williamson, said: ""Fairness to young people has been and will continue to be fundamental to every decision we take on these issues.""

"Police investigations have been compromised by an error that led to hundreds of thousands of records being deleted from UK-wide databases, according to a letter seen by the BBC. The National Police Chiefs' Council said 213,000 records were deleted - more than the 150,000first reported,external. This resulted in a couple of ""near misses"" for serious crimes when trying to identify an offender, it said. The Home Office has said it isassessing the impactof the mistake. Data including fingerprint, DNA, and arrest histories was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion. The PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. The Home Office said the lost entries related to people who were arrested and then released without further action. Technical issue sees '150,000 police records lost' What does Brexit mean for security in the UK? But the letter from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says officers are aware of at least one instance where the DNA profile from a suspect in custody did not generate a match to a crime scene as expected, potentially impeding the investigation. It says that some of the records had been marked for indefinite retention following earlier convictions for serious offences. And it reveals that a ""weeding system"", developed and deployed by a Home Office PNC team, started to delete records wrongly last November. The process was only brought to a halt at the start of this week. The letter was sent on Friday afternoon by Deputy Chief Constable Naveed Malik of the NPCC to chief constables and police and crime commissioners. The deletion of the records has been blamed on a coding error. This resulted in records that had been flagged for deletion being lost from the database before checks had been carried out to determine whether they could be lawfully held or not. Policing minister Kit Malthouse said the problem had been identified and the process corrected so ""it cannot happen again"". He said the Home Office, National Police Chiefs' Council and other law enforcement partners were working ""at pace"" to recover the data. The Home Office said no records of criminal or dangerous persons had been deleted. But Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he described the situation as ""extraordinarily serious"", adding: ""Priti Patel will be responsible for criminals walking free. We're not going to be able to link suspects to crime scenes without the DNA and fingerprint evidence."" A home office source said the accusation was ""scaremongering and irresponsible"". Former Cumbria Police Chief Constable Stuart Hyde told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday the ""very large"" loss of arrest records presented a ""risk to public safety"". The records are linked to police investigations that were terminated before charge (No Further Action or NFA cases) or to those where an individual had been acquitted at court. It is not yet known how many records of each type were lost and full extent of deletions is still being investigated. A minister is expected to update the House of Commons on Monday. It comes after about 40,000 alerts relating to European criminals were removed from the PNC following the UK's post-Brexit security deal with the EU.

"Men who had already had the virus were asked to donate blood plasma for the trial A potential treatment for Covid using blood plasma does not reduce deaths among hospital patients, trials show. The results are a blow to researchers and the NHS, which led the drive to collect plasma donations. This arm of theRecovery trial,external, which is investigating a number of promising Covid treatments, has now been closed. The Oxford researchers involved say they are ""incredibly grateful"" for the contribution of patients across the country. Donations of plasma were temporarily suspended, according to NHS Blood and Transplant.** There had been huge international interest in the role of convalescent plasma as a possible treatment for hospital patients with Covid-19. The treatment involves blood plasma being taken from people who have recovered from the disease - which contains antibodies to coronavirus - and transfused into seriously ill patients. It was hoped the plasma donation would give the recipient's struggling immune system a boost to fight off Covid. The NHS had been urging people to donate, particularly men who are thought to have higher levels of antibodies in their blood. But early analysis of 1,873 deaths in a study of 10,400 UK patients shows the treatment made ""no significant difference"". In the group treated with convalescent plasma, 18% of patients died within 28 days - the same figure for the group given standard treatment. Patients in the study are still being followed up and the final results will be published shortly. Earlier this week, a separate study showed no evidence that the same treatment improved outcomes for patients in intensive care. Martin Landray, chief investigator and professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the Recovery trial showed ""the value of large randomised trials to properly assess the role of potential treatments"". The trial is still investigating other treatments, including tocilizumab, aspirin and an antibody cocktail. Prof Peter Horby, who also worked on the trial, said the largest ever trial of convalescent plasma ""was only possible thanks to the generous donation of plasma by recovered patients and the willingness of current patients to contribute to advancing medical care"". ""While the overall result is negative, we need to await the full results before we can understand whether convalescent plasma has any role in particular patient sub-groups,"" he said. **NHS Blood and Transplant restarted donations of blood plasma,externalon 20 January. They could be used to see whether particular groups of patients, such as those with low antibody levels, could benefit. International trials are also testing if plasma helps people when it's used much earlier in the disease, before people get to hospital. Which treatments work best against Covid?

"UK meat exporters have claimed post-Brexit customs systems are ""not fit for purpose"", with goods delayed for hours, sometimes days, at the border. The British Meat Processor Association said even experienced exporters were struggling with the system. It said meat exports to the EU were 25% of normal levels for this time of year. One large French meat importer told the BBC that he and his competitors were starting to look at alternative suppliers in Spain and Ireland. The BBC has contacted the government for comment. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processor Association, said: ""Fundamentally, this is not a system that was designed for a 24/7, just-in-time supply chain. ""The export health certification process was designed for moving containers of frozen meat around the world where you have a bit of leeway on time. ""No matter how much better we get at filling in the forms, it's really not fit for purpose. This is going back to the dark ages in terms of a process really, in this digital age."" He added ""It's going to be a problem for quite a time until we move forward and hopefully get a better digital system in place and can make it work a bit better, but until then, we've got to put up with all this paperwork and lorries arriving in Ireland with box files full of paper."" Brexit: 'Most difficult week I've had in this job' Food industry warns MPs of Brexit rise in costs Customs staff: Vaccinate us to keep trade flowing Rizvan Khalid, a lamb exporter based in Shropshire, cannot afford to get the paperwork wrong. His company, Euro Quality Lambs, exports 70% of its meat to the EU, including France, Germany, Belgium and Portugal. He says what was once a once well-oiled machine now has a spanner in it. ""What used to take us 15 minutes is now taking us three or four hours on average before we can get the paperwork completed for one particular load,"" he says. ""It's taking them [on the French side] up to six hours to go through the health certificates, to open up the lorry and check the goods. ""All of that is adding time and costs. It's now an extra day before our product gets into the markets of Paris."" Meanwhile, some buyers in the EU are losing patience and are beginning to consider other options. Francis Ochoa's meat company, Fory Viandes, is based in one of the world's biggest fresh produce markets - the Rungis market, south of Paris. ""The delays and extra costs mean me and my competitors in the market are obliged to start looking for other solutions,"" he says. ""One of the solutions unfortunately is to try produce from other countries, Spain for instance. Some of our competitors are ordering lambs from Ireland instead of the UK, so the consequences for UK meat and UK lambs could be disastrous."" Down at the international freight checkpoint in Ashford, near the entrance to the Eurotunnel, customs consultant Steve Cocks gave a downbeat assessment. ""The temporary border post lorry park is full, roads are being closed off and lorries are being sent back to the Covid testing site to hold them there,"" he said. ""Last week wasn't much to write home about as it was very quiet, but volumes are building and it's just going to get worse. Exports are grinding to a halt and that will affect imports, but if you are a haulier. you don't want to get a lorry stuck on this side of the Channel."" After decades of friction-free trade, there are bound to be teething problems. Indeed, the government predicted that there would be ""significant additional disruption"" as traders, officials and customers became accustomed to new procedures. However, some things cannot ""bed in"" and will become permanent features. HMRC estimates the additional cost to UK business of bog-standard customs declarations alone at Â£7bn. When buyers and sellers want to trade, they will find a way, but significant additional cost and complexity is here to stay.

"This video can not be played UK weather: Will it snow where you are? Snow and ice weather warnings are in place for much of England and Scotland after widespread recent snowfall. The Met Office has issuedyellow weather warnings,externalacross England and Scotland for Saturday and warned of possible travel disruption. Parts of England and Scotland could see as much as 5-10cm of snow in higher areas, the weather service said. It comes ashundreds of schools remain closedafter heavy snow hit the north of England on Thursday. A snow warning is in place for south-east England, including London, the east of England and the East Midlands. The Met Office said East Anglia and parts of Kent and Sussex are most at risk of snow. In pictures: Winter scenes from around the UK Some 1-3 cm of snow may fall fairly widely over these areas, with 5-10 cm possible in places, mostly over parts of East Anglia and any higher ground. A snow and ice warning is in place for most of Scotland, north-west and north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands and parts of the West Midlands. Snow is likely to fall to low levels over east Scotland and northern England. The Met Office said 1-3 cm is possible at low levels in these areas but is more likely at higher elevations, where 5-10 cm of snow is possible above 200m - and even 20cm at the highest places. Fog is also forecast for parts of the Midlands and the North, along with mist around Glasgow which may pose hazards for motorists. Heavy snow hits ambulance and vaccine services In pictures: Snowy scenes across Yorkshire Ice warnings following day of heavy snow Police forces in Yorkshire have urged people to stay at home unless their travel is essential Two girls took their sledge to a golf course near Penicuik, Midlothian The coronavirus vaccine rollout has been affected by the weather. Over-80s who were due to receive their jab at Newcastle's Centre for Life were told they could re-book rather than risk making a trip in the icy conditions. Newcastle Hospitals tweeted: ""There's enough vaccine for everyone, so don't worry about making a trip to Newcastle."" And Leeds University has delayed the opening of its asymptomatic Covid-19 test centre. Heavy snowfall has already caused travel disruption across sections of northern England and Scotland. Temperatures were as low as -6C on Friday morning in parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria, with yellow warnings set to last through most of Friday. There was a loss of gas supply to approximately 700 homes in the Hebden Bridge area after water got into the local gas network and froze. The Met Office has published advice from the Department for Transport advising people to clear snow and ice from footpaths outside their homes, preferably in the morning. ""You can then cover the path with salt before nightfall to stop it refreezing overnight,"" the advice says. Temperatures in the Greater London area are expected to drop to 1C on Friday and parts of the South East could fall to -2C. It comes after ""hazardous"" conditions on Thursday causedproblems for the ambulance service in Yorkshire, which struggled to keep up with the high demand, whileCovid vaccinations were also affected. Mark Millins, of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said the bad weather was having a ""severe impact"" on its operations and urged people to ""take extra care"" when out walking or driving. In Scotland, heavy snow in some areasresulted in road closures. The deepest snow on Thursday was in Bingley, West Yorkshire, and Strathallan in Perth, Scotland, both of which recorded 11cm.

"Ambulances were lined up outside the Royal London Hospital on Thursday Covid patients have been transferred to hospitals in Newcastle from over-stretched London intensive care units. A small number, fewer than five, have been moved hundreds of miles from the south east, the BBC has been told. Hospitals with the largest critical care capacity have been asked to take patients from other areas to ease pressures. However, NHS England has denied that patients have been transferred to Newcastle from London. The patient transfers were firstreported by The Guardian,external. It is not uncommon for patients to be transferred from one busy hospital to another within the region, but moving the sick from out of their areas is unusual. The North of England Critical Care Network, which co-ordinates provision in the North East, north Cumbria and North Yorkshire, confirmed patients had been moved from other parts of England. In statement, director Lesley Durham said: ""During this pandemic and at these times of unprecedented pressures, we have ensured equity of patient access to critical care though mutual aid between units in the form of critical care patient transfers. ""We are also working with our colleagues and networks further afield. ""Whilst not ideal, it is correct to ensure that every person, regardless of location, has access to a critical care bed if they require one."" One medical expert described transferring people across the country as ""a challenge"" Elsewhere, Northampton General Hospital - which is about 70 miles from London - has been receiving critical care patients from outside its area. A spokesman said: ""Some patients have been transferred to our critical care unit in recent weeks from other parts of the country, including London. ""We currently have one 'out-of-area' patient, but they are not from London."" NHS England said in a statement: ""The NHS has tried and tested plans in place to manage significant pressure either from high Covid-19 infection rates and non-Covid winter demands and this has always included mutual aid practices whereby hospitals work together to manage admissions."" It added that no patients had been transferred from London to Newcastle, Birmingham, Northampton or Sheffield. Across England in the week to 12 January, there were 32,202 patients in hospital with Covid-19, a rise of 5,735 on the previous week. In the week up to 10 January there wereÂ 330,616 new cases. Sharon Barbour - BBC Look North health correspondent Hospitals across the North East are already seeing many more patients than the first wave of the pandemic, and the next few weeks are likely to be the toughest yet. But right now some - like Newcastle - have room in intensive care and are being asked to take patients from critical care units in the south which have become overwhelmed and run out of room. Newcastle and Northumbria NHS trusts have already been taking in patients from across their own patch - most notably from Cumbria where there are not nearly enough intensive care beds for the soaring numbers of Covid patients. But patient numbers are growing in the North East's hospitals too, and many are already struggling. They expect next week will be the worst week they have experienced yet. To prepare, elective work is being postponed, wards are being cleared to take in new patients, and intensive care units are being expanded. Concerns have been raised about seriously-ill patients travelling such long distances. Dr Uwe Franke, intensive care lead at Middlesbrough's James Cook Hospital, said: ""The critical care networks work regionally and nationally and are trying to spread the workload about the country without pushing other units to their limits or out of the durability of their capacity. ""But there is a difficulty in this; we know that Covid patients are incredibly ill, they are dependent on breathing machines, they are dependent on other machines that need organ support. ""To transfer these people across the country is quite a challenge."" Dr Franke added that while hospitals in the North were keen to support colleagues across the country, some - like his own - were already reaching their limit. His hospital currently has in excess of 200 Covid patients, with 32 of those in intensive care. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"Epic Games, the studio behind the hit game Fortnite, has started legal action against Apple and Google in the UK. Both Apple and Google removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores in a row over the cut of sales they take from developers. Epic Games claims the two tech giants' rules are in violation of UK competition laws. But both companies say Epic Games broke their terms and conditions by trying to bypass their payment systems. Apple said Epic Games' action had been ""reckless"". When people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on Apple's App Store or the Google Play store, the tech giants take a cut of the fee. Typically they take a 30% cut, although in some cases the rate is lower. For this reason, some companies charge more for subscriptions when people buy directly in the app instead of on their website, while others do not sell subscriptions in-app at all. Companies are also banned from telling app users a cheaper deal is available. Epic Games has previously said it thinks a 30% cut is too much, given the amount of money and effort it invests in developing its games. In August 2020, the company bypassed the Apple and Google payment systems to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, direct from Epic. Both app stores then removed Fortnite from their services, and Apple terminated Epic Games' developer account. In documents submitted to the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CTA), Epic Games alleges thatApple,externalandGoogle,externalhave abused their dominance over their smartphone operating systems. While Apple produces iOS exclusively for its iPhones, Google's Android software is open-source so in theory any smartphone-maker can use it. However, Google also produces a suite of proprietary tools including Maps, Search and the Play Store, which power some of the most popular services on smartphones. Phone-makers must enter an agreement with Google to use them on their devices. Epic Games alleges that both companies abuse their power by: unfairly restricting competition from alternative app stores stopping developers using their own payment-processing services for purchases charging ""unfair prices for the distribution of apps"" Epic Games is not seeking a financial payout but instead wants the court to order Apple and Google to: reinstate Epic Games' software and accounts let developers use their own payment-processing systems in their apps let consumers download Epic Games' software outside of the App Store or Google Play In a statement, Epic Games said: ""We believe that this is an important argument to make on behalf of consumers and developers in the UK and around the world who are impacted by Apple and Google's misuse of market power."" It has taken similar legal action in the US and Australia. On Thursday, 21 January, the CTA will decide whether Epic Games can include US-based divisions of Apple and Google in its legal action. Apple said its priority was to create a ""safe and trusted place to download software"" and that it applied its rules equally to all developers. ""Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines,"" it said in a statement. ""Their reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to courts in the UK."" Google said: ""The open Android ecosystem lets developers distribute apps through multiple app stores. For game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users."" It said it welcomed the opportunity to ""continue discussions"" with Epic Games about bringing Fortnite back to the Google Play store.

"A Telegraph column on coronavirus by Toby Young breached press accuracy regulations The Daily Telegraph must publish a correction over a ""significantly misleading"" column written by Toby Young, press regulator Ipso has ruled. The July 2020 article claimed the common cold could provide ""natural immunity"" to Covid-19 and London was ""probably approaching herd immunity"". Buton Thursday Ipso found,externalthe paper had ""failed to take care not to publish inaccurate and misleading information"". Ipso said the paper ""did not accept it has breached the [Editors] Code"". It said the newspaper said that Young's comments on immunity referred to ""cross-reactive T-cells"" that work to combat the virus. However, the media watchdog sided with the complainant, James Whitehead, in its decision, who said that while these cells ""may lessen the impact of Covid-19"" after infection, they ""would not confer 'natural immunity'"" The ruling added Young's statement ""misrepresented the nature of immunity"". Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice? Antibodies 'fall rapidly after Covid infection' The people with hidden immunity against Covid-19 Did 'herd immunity' change the course of the outbreak? Ipso also found Young's suggestion that ""London is probably approaching herd immunity, even though only 17% tested positive [for antibodies] in the most recent seroprevalence survey""  could be misleading. There is an antibody response and a cellular response to the coronavirus The Telegraph referred to surveys listed in an article on Young's own Lockdown Sceptics website in its defence, but the Ipso committee judged these did not accurately reflect ""how herd immunity is reached and whether it exists in London"". The ruling concluded that the paper had breached accuracy standards on a topic of ""public importance"", but deemed a correction an appropriate sanction, given the level of ""significant scientific uncertainty"" at the time of publication. Young told the BBC: ""I think Ipso has been put in a difficult position because our scientific understanding of the virus is constantly evolving and there is a great deal about it that scientists still disagree about. ""While some of the things I wrote in that article would be contested by some scientists, they would be confirmed by others... Have we achieved herd immunity in London? I think that's an open question and the 'case' data is unreliable because of the well-documented shortcomings of the PCR test. ""I may have been over-emphatic in putting the anti-lockdown case, but it's not as if the advocates of a pro-lockdown position are any less emphatic. ""Don't forget the WHO initially estimated the global IFR [infection fatality rate] of Covid-19 at 3.4%. The consensus now is that it's less than 1% and almost certainly a lot less. Lots of journalists faithfully reported that alarmist figure. Why hasn't Ipso reprimanded them?"" Last week Young told BBC Newsnight that some of his claims from an article he wrote in June had been ""wrong"", where he had said a second spike of Covid-19 had ""refused to materialise"" and that one-metre rule is ""unnecessary"".

Reacting tocriticism of his past comments,externalon coronavirus from Neil O'Brien, Conservative MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston, after the deletion, Young then tweeted a defence of his stance against lockdowns.

"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: Are supermarkets following the rules? New laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after ""significant evidence"" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said shops would have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance. It comes after customers and staff raised concerns over safety, with some workers saying they had faced abuse. Mr Drakeford said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant. Speaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said the Test, Trace, Protect scheme had shown there was ""no doubt at all"" transmission was taking place in supermarkets. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Pharmacy 'first in Wales to offer Covid jab' Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die But he also said: ""I don't want anybody to get the idea that supermarkets are dangerous places - supermarkets are safe places and we're incredibly grateful to all those brave members of staff who have been in there, providing face-to-face services to members of the public since the very beginning of the pandemic. ""We want to make sure that they are even safer."" Wales remains under a level four ""stay at home"" lockdown, meaning people are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including shopping for food. But there have been growing concerns from shoppers and staff about safety in supermarkets and Mr Drakeford previously said one-way systems and number limits in stores appeared to have broken down. Supermarkets have been told to block off aisles with 'non-essential' items Some workers have claimed they are seeing shoppers walking around without masks, not using hygiene measures and shopping in large groups. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said many shops already had safety measures in place, including providing hand sanitisers, limiting numbers in store and reminding people to socially distance. The first minister said laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people in ""many communities"" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year. Mr Drakeford said people needed to see everything was ""being done to keep them safe"" and give them the ""necessary confidence... to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown."" Under the laws, set to come into force early next week, all retailers will need to have: signs visible to help people keep their distance and make their way around the store sanitiser available for hands and trolleys systems in place to limit the number of people who can be in store at any one time These measures were already guidance, but will now be law, and supermarket owners and managers will be responsible for ensuring the new rules are followed. ""Many [shops] are already operating high standards and we need to raise the bar for those who could and should improve,"" Mr Drakeford said. Some shop workers had told BBC Wales they were facing ""daily abuse"" for challenging rule-breakers, with some threatened and spat at. The Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) has warned the onus on policing customers' behaviour must not fall on shop workers. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets While Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium said trying to enforce laws had created ""further conflict and flashpoint"" with customers, leading to workers being abused. ""We ask that all customers play their part in keeping our stores safe, shopping alone where possible, following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers,"" she said. ""We also ask that government considers legislating for better protections for shop workers, as is being planned in Scotland."" Mr Drakeford said it was ""entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic"" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions.Staff had been ""going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table"", he said. Nick Ireland, regional secretary for Usdaw for Wales and the south west of England, said shop workers were anxious about confronting customers not adhering to guidance in shops. 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries? ""We've asked for clearer signage, and robust one way systems,"" he said. ""Some shoppers seem to forget about two metre social distancing, particularly when it comes the workforce in stores."" Health spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said new rules for shops were ""overdue"". He said it was ""certainly the right thing to do"", and was ""totally unacceptable for any supermarket staff to be the subject of any abuse over this"". Meanwhile, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""quite clear that we are lagging behind other parts of the UK"" in regards to numbers of people vaccinated. ""It's important to get those vaccines out to people and get the vaccines into people's arms,"" he added. Mr Drakeford said enforcement action could be taken against supermarkets over breaches of Covid rules. During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations. ""Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,"" he said. ""They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require."" The first minister said there was also the ""wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers"". ""I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,"" Mr Drakeford added. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?

"UK to close all travel corridors from 04:00 GMT on Monday, PM Boris Johnson said at Downing Street press conference Travellers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test in previous 72 hours - with new rules in place until at least 15 February More than 2 million people have now died of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University UK government scientists put the coronavirus R number - the average rate of spread - in the UK at 1.2 to 1.3, similar to last week A ban on travellers from South America and Portugal came into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil The health system in the Brazilian city of Manaus is said to be collapsing amid soaring infections linked to the new variant Edited by Sarah Collerton We are going to be closing the live page soon so here's a recap of today's coronavirus headlines:  That's all from the live team but we will be back tomorrow. These updates were brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Sarah Collerton, Vanessa Barford, Emma Harrison, George Wright, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Bisset and Joshua Cheetham. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that the city may run out of coronavirus vaccines next week without a resupply. âIf we donât get a serious supply, weâre going to have to freeze the appointment system,"" he told WNYC radio. ""That would be insane, after all the progress weâve made.â He's the latest official to express concern for vaccine supplies, in a state that was once at the epicentre of America's outbreak and continues to be one of the worst-affected parts of the US. New York State receives about 300,000 doses a week, and a third of these go to New York City, according to officials. But Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that the state would be receiving 50,000 fewer doses next week. While New York City has historically been struggling to administer jabs at scale, the pace picked up this week due to the expansion of vaccination sites, and more people becoming eligible. Between Monday and Thursday, the city administered nearly 120,000 doses. A temporary mortuary that can hold up to 1,300 bodies has been opened in Ruislip, west London, as the capital faces a growing coronavirus death toll. London recently exceeded 10,000 Covid-related deaths, a figure Mayor Sadiq Khan described as ""heartbreaking"". The Breakspear Crematorium facility, which took a week to build and cost about Â£3m, isexpected to receive bodies from Friday. It has been called ""a visual, sobering reminder"" of the continuing cost of the pandemic. Westminster City Council chief executive Stuart Love, who is leading the London-wide response, says: ""We have built this really hoping it doesn't get used to its capacity. ""This just re-emphasises the message of staying at home and looking after your loved ones."" Portugal has entered its second national lockdown, with all non-essential businesses closed. Unlike in the previous lockdown, however, schools will remain open. Measures will also be relaxed for the presidential election, which takes place on 24 January. The new restrictions came into force as Portugal's daily deaths reached 159 on Friday. Infections, meanwhile, were at the second-highest number since the pandemic began, with 10,663 new cases announced the same day. Portugal has recorded more than half a million cases and 8,543 deaths from Covid-19, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Norwegian Air has axed its long haul network due to the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry Airline bosses have said they support the government's decision to close all travel corridors to the UK to prevent the import of new variants of coronavirus. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of
Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers,
said: âTravel
corridors were a lifeline for the industry last summer and the government were
right to bring them in when they did. ""But things change and thereâs no doubting
this is a serious health emergency and ministers need to act to keep borders
safe and the public protected. ""We therefore support this latest measure, on the
assumption that we will work with government â when the time is right â to
remove these restrictions when it is safe to do so and start to open up our
sector again, to support the UKâs economic recovery.â Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all travel corridors with the UK will be closed from 04:00 GMT on Monday. This means all arrivals to the UK must self-isolate or quarantine for up to 10 days upon arrival to the country (most passengers will also need proof of a negative Covid test too). When it comes to enforcement of the quarantine rules, the latest figures we have show police in England and Wales investigated around 9,000 cases â of reported breaches - in the period to 24 November 2020. The majority â just over 7,000 - needed no further investigation. In almost 1,400 cases, the police were unable to take any action because no-one answered the door or they had the wrong address. Just 223 fines were actually given out. Border Force are also able to hand out fines but we canât find any figures for this. A survey from the Office for National Statistics in October showed that roughly two-thirds of people in England said they were following the quarantine rules. This means the other third said they had breached the rules in some way or another. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government announcement to suspend all UK travel corridors
is the âright stepâ but called the timing of the decision âslow againâ. He says the public will be thinking âwhy on earth didnât this happen
before?"" He also ""urgently"" called for a âlonger term plan for the
airline industryâ going forward and said that the enforcement of isolation upon
arrival needs to be properly addressed, as âthe quarantine hasnât really been
policed effectively at all.â Asked if he forced former Scottish Labour Leader Richard
Leonardâs hand in resigning, Mr Starmer said he wanted to âpay tribute to
Richard and everything he achievedâ and insisted the decision was his alone. The prime minister finished a Downing Street press
conference a short time ago. He was speaking alongside England's chief medical officer
Prof Chris Whitty and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the main takeaways: Asked about reports of deliveries of vaccines being cancelled, the prime minister says the crucial thing is that everyone gets down to their vaccination centre when they get the message to come for their vaccine. ""When we have the problem of some groups or some people not getting the message or perhaps being a bit reluctant to go for one reason or another that we all work to make it clear this is a great thing to do,"" the PM says. He says local councils and public health directors will know where to find people who are hard to reach. ""We have got the Army, we've got pharmacies and we have got the NHS,"" he adds. That marks the end of the press conference. We will bring you a round-up of it shortly. More than two million people have now died with Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has recorded more fatalities than any other country, with almost 390,000 deaths, followed by Brazil and India with around 200,000 and 150,000 deaths respectively. More than 93 million infections have been recorded worldwide. The prime minister says there is ""clearly"" a problem with care home infections and the government is working ""flat-out"" to vaccinate residents and staff. About 40% of elderly residents have received jabs and the hope is that the programme will be complete by the end of January, he adds. In some areas, 80% to 90% of 80-year-olds have received vaccination offers, Boris Johnson says. Sir Patrick Vallance calls it a ""miracle"" that so many vaccines have been developed so quickly. It's too soon to see the effect on transmission yet, but it would be ""very surprising"" if they didn't have a ""decent effect"" in curbing the spread, he says. Sebastian Payne, of the Financial Times, asks what will happen to the rest of society once the most vulnerable are inoculated. Boris Johnson says it is the question which preoccupies most of us at the moment. ""Let's focus for now on getting those cohorts, the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] groups one-to-four - the over-70s, the over-80s - vaccinated and I think that will already make a huge difference,"" he says. He adds there is a ""debate to be had"" on what happens after that, ""and we will make sure everybody has a chance to have their say"". Asked again about vaccine wastage, Prof Chris Whitty says there have been ""perfectly sensible decisions made by GPs"" to maximise the delivery of vaccines, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine which needs to be stored at -70C. He says the overwhelming volume of vaccines have gone to the over-80s. Speaking earlier at the Downing Street press conference, the prime minister announced the UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Watch here: This video can not be played PM announces that the UK's travel corridors will close The threat of unidentified Covid strains from abroad means tougher action is needed, the PM says. Asked about figures on supply of vaccines and some reports of wastage, Boris Johnson says the key question is ""getting jabs into arms"". Batches have to be tested for safety, he adds, saying that the government is ""using all the supply that we can possibly lay our hands on"". Prof Chris Whitty says he has never said things will get better by Easter, adding the PM may have quoted him as saying that. But he says an improvement is likely at some point during spring. Increasingly, he predicts, the vaccine will do ""more of the heavy lifting"" in dealing with the pandemic. The situation will get ""a lot better than it is now"" in the next few months, Whitty says. Sir Patrick Vallance says a lot of work is going on to ""optimise"" workplace hygiene to prevent infections. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent There have long been calls
for the rules for people arriving into the UK to be tightened up to stop Covid cases being imported. The government only this
month introduced the requirement for proof of a negative Covid test on entry
and other countries have had stricter policies in place for months. With two prominent variants
of the virus - originating in Brazil and South Africa - already on the
governmentâs radar, ministers seem determined to get ahead of any others that
may yet pose a risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks if the move to put restrictions in at the borders is too late. The PM says the government is taking steps to protect against the new variants. ""We have a situation now where we have a very high rate of domestic infection in the UK combined with a vaccination programme,"" he says. ""There will come a point in the next weeks and months where the vaccination programme will take effect... and you will see a decline in the death rate. ""What you can't have is a situation where you have new variants with unknown qualities coming in from abroad and that's why we have set up the system to stop arrivals where new variants are a concern."" Sir Patrick Vallance says the virus is changing all the time and he suspects there are variants ""all over the world of different types"". ""The countries which have detected them first have got good sequencing,"" he says. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says some hospitals in London and south-eastern England are so busy they're having to move patients hundreds of miles and asks how the NHS is set to cope over the next few weeks. The PM says the NHS in London has been coping ""magnificently"" and intensive care units are not yet overwhelmed. There are ""tentative early signs that the pressure might be easing slightly"" in the capital but it's too early to be confident of that. Prof Chris Whitty says the hope is that infections have already peaked in some areas of the country, but the peak of hospitalisations is delayed until about a week after infections, with the peak of deaths later still. The peak of deaths is, he says, likely to be in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says the measures in place must remain in place to suppress the figures. Michael from Cornwall asks at what rate of deaths and infections the government will lift lockdown restrictions. The prime minister says the government wants to get to a stage where the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. ""Depending on the effectiveness of that roll-out, and we are hoping to do all of them by the 15 February, we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions, but it will also depend on where the disease is and what's happening,"" he says. ""We can't have any false sense of security so that we lift the restrictions all together and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations,"" Mr Johnson adds. Prof Whitty says we will not ""move from a sudden lockdown situation to nothing"". Asked about plans for any future variant that may be more easily transmissable, the PM says a lot of scientific work is being done on keeping vaccines updated. He adds that the ""tough"" measures at borders and airports will also help this effort. Sir Patrick Vallance says there's a ""very comprehensive"" method used to keep up with developments. The new UK variant transmits more readily but there's nothing to suggest it's more intense. Other variants may get round vaccines in the future, he adds, but scientists ""don't know that"". Vaccines are ""really quite easy to adjust"", thanks to recent developments, Sir Patrick adds. It's also likely that vaccines used now will protect against new variants, he says. Prof Chris Whitty stresses the need for international co-operation on vaccines to keep ahead of variants that develop. Prof Whitty says deaths will continue to rise into next week because of the lag between people going into hospital and then some dying. But he says the effects of everyone's actions will begin to reduce ""this strong pressure"" on the NHS, along with the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A nurse prepares a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Cannes, France Several EU countries are receiving significantly fewer doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine than expected, after the US firm slowed shipments. Six nations called the situation ""unacceptable"" and warned it ""decreases the credibility of the vaccination process"". Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia urged the EU to apply pressure on Pfizer-BioNTech. Pfizer said the reduced deliveries were a temporary issue. In a statement on Friday, the drugmaker said shipments were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes designed to boost production. ""Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,"" Pfizer said. Whatâs happening to the EU vaccine scheme? Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Shocked to be Europe's vaccination stragglers The company said its production upgrades would also have a ""short-term impact"" on the delivery of vaccines to the UK. Despite this, the UK government said it still planned to hit its target of vaccinating all priority groups by mid-February - about 15 million people. The vaccine from Pfizer is not the only candidate available in the UK, with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca jab also currently being rolled out. The EU is not wholly reliant on the Pfizer jab either, having approved a vaccine manufactured by US company Moderna for use. Still, the development is expected to slow the pace of vaccination programmes. The German health ministry called Pfizer's announcement surprising and regrettable, noting that it had committed to binding delivery dates until mid-February. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had been assured by Pfizer's chief executive that all orders guaranteed for delivery in the first quarter of the year would arrive. Last week, Ms von der Leyen said Pfizer had agreed to supply the EU with 600 million doses this year, double its initial order. The pledge may do little to soothe European governments battling to subdue a fast-spreading Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK. About a third of the 27 EU governments reported having ""insufficient"" vaccine doses at a meeting this week, Reuters reported, citing a participant. Lithuania said it would now get only half as many Pfizer vaccine doses as promised until mid-February. Belgium said it expected to receive about half the planned doses in January. Canada is also affected, because its vaccine supplies come from a Pfizer factory in Belgium. Norway, which is not an EU member, said on Friday that Pfizer was temporarily reducing the number of vaccine doses delivered to the country as of next week. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement that it could supplement the loss using ""emergency stock"". ""The stock we now have will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead,"" it said. As well as Pfizer-BioNTech, the European Commission has reached agreements with five other pharmaceutical companies to purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, once they pass clinical trials: AstraZeneca: 400 million doses Sanofi-GSK: 300 million doses Johnson & Johnson: 400 million doses CureVac: 405 million doses Moderna: 160 million doses The Commission concluded initial talks with another company,Novavax, for up to 200 million doses. Elsewhere in the world, Turkey said it had vaccinated half a million people in two days with vaccines developed by China's Sinovac Biotech. The figures suggest Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its roll-out than France did in almost three weeks. The French government faced a storm of criticism after it emerged that only 500 people had been vaccinated in the first week of the roll-out, which began in late December. Vaccination efforts have since stepped up, though, with 388,730 people receiving at least one dose so far,according to CovidTracker,external. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden on Friday unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations against Covid-19 when he takes office on 20 January. Mr Biden said his administration would set up new mass vaccination centres and hire extra health workers to achieve his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office. The incoming president made the announcement asthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a stark warning about the spread of a highly transmissible coronavirus variantin the US. India, meanwhile,launched the world's largest vaccination campaign on Saturday. Efforts are under way to inoculate 1.3 billion people against the disease, starting with healthcare and frontline workers. Two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Covaxin - are being used in India.

"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: Are supermarkets following the rules? New laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after ""significant evidence"" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said shops would have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance. It comes after customers and staff raised concerns over safety, with some workers saying they had faced abuse. Mr Drakeford said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant. Speaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said the Test, Trace, Protect scheme had shown there was ""no doubt at all"" transmission was taking place in supermarkets. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Pharmacy 'first in Wales to offer Covid jab' Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die But he also said: ""I don't want anybody to get the idea that supermarkets are dangerous places - supermarkets are safe places and we're incredibly grateful to all those brave members of staff who have been in there, providing face-to-face services to members of the public since the very beginning of the pandemic. ""We want to make sure that they are even safer."" Wales remains under a level four ""stay at home"" lockdown, meaning people are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including shopping for food. But there have been growing concerns from shoppers and staff about safety in supermarkets and Mr Drakeford previously said one-way systems and number limits in stores appeared to have broken down. Supermarkets have been told to block off aisles with 'non-essential' items Some workers have claimed they are seeing shoppers walking around without masks, not using hygiene measures and shopping in large groups. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said many shops already had safety measures in place, including providing hand sanitisers, limiting numbers in store and reminding people to socially distance. The first minister said laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people in ""many communities"" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year. Mr Drakeford said people needed to see everything was ""being done to keep them safe"" and give them the ""necessary confidence... to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown."" Under the laws, set to come into force early next week, all retailers will need to have: signs visible to help people keep their distance and make their way around the store sanitiser available for hands and trolleys systems in place to limit the number of people who can be in store at any one time These measures were already guidance, but will now be law, and supermarket owners and managers will be responsible for ensuring the new rules are followed. ""Many [shops] are already operating high standards and we need to raise the bar for those who could and should improve,"" Mr Drakeford said. Some shop workers had told BBC Wales they were facing ""daily abuse"" for challenging rule-breakers, with some threatened and spat at. The Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) has warned the onus on policing customers' behaviour must not fall on shop workers. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets While Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium said trying to enforce laws had created ""further conflict and flashpoint"" with customers, leading to workers being abused. ""We ask that all customers play their part in keeping our stores safe, shopping alone where possible, following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers,"" she said. ""We also ask that government considers legislating for better protections for shop workers, as is being planned in Scotland."" Mr Drakeford said it was ""entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic"" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions.Staff had been ""going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table"", he said. Nick Ireland, regional secretary for Usdaw for Wales and the south west of England, said shop workers were anxious about confronting customers not adhering to guidance in shops. 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries? ""We've asked for clearer signage, and robust one way systems,"" he said. ""Some shoppers seem to forget about two metre social distancing, particularly when it comes the workforce in stores."" Health spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said new rules for shops were ""overdue"". He said it was ""certainly the right thing to do"", and was ""totally unacceptable for any supermarket staff to be the subject of any abuse over this"". Meanwhile, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""quite clear that we are lagging behind other parts of the UK"" in regards to numbers of people vaccinated. ""It's important to get those vaccines out to people and get the vaccines into people's arms,"" he added. Mr Drakeford said enforcement action could be taken against supermarkets over breaches of Covid rules. During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations. ""Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,"" he said. ""They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require."" The first minister said there was also the ""wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers"". ""I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,"" Mr Drakeford added. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?

"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

"There are more than 40 countries onthe government's red list,external, which has the strictest travel restrictions. One is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a""variant of concern"",externaland more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK. But despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries. A traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests. What are the travel rules? Matt Hancock's India Covid claim fact-checked Red list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited ""except in the most extreme of circumstances"". If you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident. You must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Direct flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home. On one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow. Coronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them. British and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved ""as fast as we could"" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a ""very tough regime"". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation. Labour said there had been a lack of a ""comprehensive"" border system. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? What is the government doing about the South Africa strain? The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. The country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier. Why was India not on the red list sooner? Matt Hancock's India Covid claim fact-checked Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling,according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Positive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants. But there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK. The debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic. Between January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus. Quarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from ""high-risk countries"" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days. Aninquiry into the pandemic,externalsuggested it was understandable the government ""did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights"" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home. But these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown. ""The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,"" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. One study found,externalthe virus was introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)advised against travel bans,external, saying they were ""usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact"". In April 2021, the WHO said it wouldupdate its ""risk-based guidance"",externalon Covid and international travel. The Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was ""incorrect in their assertions"". It said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. It argued that by mid-March 2020 there was ""significant transmission"" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a ""very marginal"" impact. At ameeting in February 2020,external, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. The scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required ""draconian"" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. But at itsmeeting in January 2021,external, Sage said: ""No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.""

"UK to close all travel corridors from 04:00 GMT on Monday, PM Boris Johnson said at Downing Street press conference Travellers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test in previous 72 hours - with new rules in place until at least 15 February More than 2 million people have now died of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University UK government scientists put the coronavirus R number - the average rate of spread - in the UK at 1.2 to 1.3, similar to last week A ban on travellers from South America and Portugal came into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil The health system in the Brazilian city of Manaus is said to be collapsing amid soaring infections linked to the new variant Edited by Sarah Collerton We are going to be closing the live page soon so here's a recap of today's coronavirus headlines:  That's all from the live team but we will be back tomorrow. These updates were brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Sarah Collerton, Vanessa Barford, Emma Harrison, George Wright, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Bisset and Joshua Cheetham. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that the city may run out of coronavirus vaccines next week without a resupply. âIf we donât get a serious supply, weâre going to have to freeze the appointment system,"" he told WNYC radio. ""That would be insane, after all the progress weâve made.â He's the latest official to express concern for vaccine supplies, in a state that was once at the epicentre of America's outbreak and continues to be one of the worst-affected parts of the US. New York State receives about 300,000 doses a week, and a third of these go to New York City, according to officials. But Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that the state would be receiving 50,000 fewer doses next week. While New York City has historically been struggling to administer jabs at scale, the pace picked up this week due to the expansion of vaccination sites, and more people becoming eligible. Between Monday and Thursday, the city administered nearly 120,000 doses. A temporary mortuary that can hold up to 1,300 bodies has been opened in Ruislip, west London, as the capital faces a growing coronavirus death toll. London recently exceeded 10,000 Covid-related deaths, a figure Mayor Sadiq Khan described as ""heartbreaking"". The Breakspear Crematorium facility, which took a week to build and cost about Â£3m, isexpected to receive bodies from Friday. It has been called ""a visual, sobering reminder"" of the continuing cost of the pandemic. Westminster City Council chief executive Stuart Love, who is leading the London-wide response, says: ""We have built this really hoping it doesn't get used to its capacity. ""This just re-emphasises the message of staying at home and looking after your loved ones."" Portugal has entered its second national lockdown, with all non-essential businesses closed. Unlike in the previous lockdown, however, schools will remain open. Measures will also be relaxed for the presidential election, which takes place on 24 January. The new restrictions came into force as Portugal's daily deaths reached 159 on Friday. Infections, meanwhile, were at the second-highest number since the pandemic began, with 10,663 new cases announced the same day. Portugal has recorded more than half a million cases and 8,543 deaths from Covid-19, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Norwegian Air has axed its long haul network due to the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry Airline bosses have said they support the government's decision to close all travel corridors to the UK to prevent the import of new variants of coronavirus. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of
Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers,
said: âTravel
corridors were a lifeline for the industry last summer and the government were
right to bring them in when they did. ""But things change and thereâs no doubting
this is a serious health emergency and ministers need to act to keep borders
safe and the public protected. ""We therefore support this latest measure, on the
assumption that we will work with government â when the time is right â to
remove these restrictions when it is safe to do so and start to open up our
sector again, to support the UKâs economic recovery.â Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all travel corridors with the UK will be closed from 04:00 GMT on Monday. This means all arrivals to the UK must self-isolate or quarantine for up to 10 days upon arrival to the country (most passengers will also need proof of a negative Covid test too). When it comes to enforcement of the quarantine rules, the latest figures we have show police in England and Wales investigated around 9,000 cases â of reported breaches - in the period to 24 November 2020. The majority â just over 7,000 - needed no further investigation. In almost 1,400 cases, the police were unable to take any action because no-one answered the door or they had the wrong address. Just 223 fines were actually given out. Border Force are also able to hand out fines but we canât find any figures for this. A survey from the Office for National Statistics in October showed that roughly two-thirds of people in England said they were following the quarantine rules. This means the other third said they had breached the rules in some way or another. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government announcement to suspend all UK travel corridors
is the âright stepâ but called the timing of the decision âslow againâ. He says the public will be thinking âwhy on earth didnât this happen
before?"" He also ""urgently"" called for a âlonger term plan for the
airline industryâ going forward and said that the enforcement of isolation upon
arrival needs to be properly addressed, as âthe quarantine hasnât really been
policed effectively at all.â Asked if he forced former Scottish Labour Leader Richard
Leonardâs hand in resigning, Mr Starmer said he wanted to âpay tribute to
Richard and everything he achievedâ and insisted the decision was his alone. The prime minister finished a Downing Street press
conference a short time ago. He was speaking alongside England's chief medical officer
Prof Chris Whitty and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the main takeaways: Asked about reports of deliveries of vaccines being cancelled, the prime minister says the crucial thing is that everyone gets down to their vaccination centre when they get the message to come for their vaccine. ""When we have the problem of some groups or some people not getting the message or perhaps being a bit reluctant to go for one reason or another that we all work to make it clear this is a great thing to do,"" the PM says. He says local councils and public health directors will know where to find people who are hard to reach. ""We have got the Army, we've got pharmacies and we have got the NHS,"" he adds. That marks the end of the press conference. We will bring you a round-up of it shortly. More than two million people have now died with Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has recorded more fatalities than any other country, with almost 390,000 deaths, followed by Brazil and India with around 200,000 and 150,000 deaths respectively. More than 93 million infections have been recorded worldwide. The prime minister says there is ""clearly"" a problem with care home infections and the government is working ""flat-out"" to vaccinate residents and staff. About 40% of elderly residents have received jabs and the hope is that the programme will be complete by the end of January, he adds. In some areas, 80% to 90% of 80-year-olds have received vaccination offers, Boris Johnson says. Sir Patrick Vallance calls it a ""miracle"" that so many vaccines have been developed so quickly. It's too soon to see the effect on transmission yet, but it would be ""very surprising"" if they didn't have a ""decent effect"" in curbing the spread, he says. Sebastian Payne, of the Financial Times, asks what will happen to the rest of society once the most vulnerable are inoculated. Boris Johnson says it is the question which preoccupies most of us at the moment. ""Let's focus for now on getting those cohorts, the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] groups one-to-four - the over-70s, the over-80s - vaccinated and I think that will already make a huge difference,"" he says. He adds there is a ""debate to be had"" on what happens after that, ""and we will make sure everybody has a chance to have their say"". Asked again about vaccine wastage, Prof Chris Whitty says there have been ""perfectly sensible decisions made by GPs"" to maximise the delivery of vaccines, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine which needs to be stored at -70C. He says the overwhelming volume of vaccines have gone to the over-80s. Speaking earlier at the Downing Street press conference, the prime minister announced the UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Watch here: This video can not be played PM announces that the UK's travel corridors will close The threat of unidentified Covid strains from abroad means tougher action is needed, the PM says. Asked about figures on supply of vaccines and some reports of wastage, Boris Johnson says the key question is ""getting jabs into arms"". Batches have to be tested for safety, he adds, saying that the government is ""using all the supply that we can possibly lay our hands on"". Prof Chris Whitty says he has never said things will get better by Easter, adding the PM may have quoted him as saying that. But he says an improvement is likely at some point during spring. Increasingly, he predicts, the vaccine will do ""more of the heavy lifting"" in dealing with the pandemic. The situation will get ""a lot better than it is now"" in the next few months, Whitty says. Sir Patrick Vallance says a lot of work is going on to ""optimise"" workplace hygiene to prevent infections. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent There have long been calls
for the rules for people arriving into the UK to be tightened up to stop Covid cases being imported. The government only this
month introduced the requirement for proof of a negative Covid test on entry
and other countries have had stricter policies in place for months. With two prominent variants
of the virus - originating in Brazil and South Africa - already on the
governmentâs radar, ministers seem determined to get ahead of any others that
may yet pose a risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks if the move to put restrictions in at the borders is too late. The PM says the government is taking steps to protect against the new variants. ""We have a situation now where we have a very high rate of domestic infection in the UK combined with a vaccination programme,"" he says. ""There will come a point in the next weeks and months where the vaccination programme will take effect... and you will see a decline in the death rate. ""What you can't have is a situation where you have new variants with unknown qualities coming in from abroad and that's why we have set up the system to stop arrivals where new variants are a concern."" Sir Patrick Vallance says the virus is changing all the time and he suspects there are variants ""all over the world of different types"". ""The countries which have detected them first have got good sequencing,"" he says. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says some hospitals in London and south-eastern England are so busy they're having to move patients hundreds of miles and asks how the NHS is set to cope over the next few weeks. The PM says the NHS in London has been coping ""magnificently"" and intensive care units are not yet overwhelmed. There are ""tentative early signs that the pressure might be easing slightly"" in the capital but it's too early to be confident of that. Prof Chris Whitty says the hope is that infections have already peaked in some areas of the country, but the peak of hospitalisations is delayed until about a week after infections, with the peak of deaths later still. The peak of deaths is, he says, likely to be in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says the measures in place must remain in place to suppress the figures. Michael from Cornwall asks at what rate of deaths and infections the government will lift lockdown restrictions. The prime minister says the government wants to get to a stage where the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. ""Depending on the effectiveness of that roll-out, and we are hoping to do all of them by the 15 February, we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions, but it will also depend on where the disease is and what's happening,"" he says. ""We can't have any false sense of security so that we lift the restrictions all together and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations,"" Mr Johnson adds. Prof Whitty says we will not ""move from a sudden lockdown situation to nothing"". Asked about plans for any future variant that may be more easily transmissable, the PM says a lot of scientific work is being done on keeping vaccines updated. He adds that the ""tough"" measures at borders and airports will also help this effort. Sir Patrick Vallance says there's a ""very comprehensive"" method used to keep up with developments. The new UK variant transmits more readily but there's nothing to suggest it's more intense. Other variants may get round vaccines in the future, he adds, but scientists ""don't know that"". Vaccines are ""really quite easy to adjust"", thanks to recent developments, Sir Patrick adds. It's also likely that vaccines used now will protect against new variants, he says. Prof Chris Whitty stresses the need for international co-operation on vaccines to keep ahead of variants that develop. Prof Whitty says deaths will continue to rise into next week because of the lag between people going into hospital and then some dying. But he says the effects of everyone's actions will begin to reduce ""this strong pressure"" on the NHS, along with the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""We will temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday"" The UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday morning to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid, the PM has said. Anyone flying into the country from overseas will have to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off. It comes as aban on travellers from South America and Portugalcame into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. Boris Johnson said the new rules would be in place until at least 15 February. A further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291. The latest government figures on Friday,externalalso showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported - up from 48,682 the previous day. Meanwhile, more than two million people around the world have now died with the virus since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.,external What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Scotland to suspend travel corridors from Monday Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said it was ""vital"" to take extra measures now ""when day by day we are making such strides in protecting the population"". ""It's precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country."" All travel corridors will close from 04:00 GMT on Monday.,externalAfter that, arrivals to the UK will need to quarantine for up to 10 days, unless they test negative after five days. Mr Johnson, who said the rules would apply across the UK after talks with the devolved administrations, added that the government would be stepping up enforcement at the border and in the country. Travel corridors were introduced in the summer to allow people travelling from some countries with low numbers of Covid cases to come to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival. Trade body Airlines UK said it supported the latest restrictions ""on the assumption"" that the government would remove them ""when it is safe to do so"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said travel corridors were ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the ""right step"" but called the timing of the decision ""slow again"", adding that the public would be thinking ""why on earth didn't this happen before"". The prime minister warned that the NHS was facing ""extraordinary pressures"", having had the highest number of hospital admissions on a single day of the pandemic earlier this week. He said that came on Tuesday when there were 4,134 new admissions, while the UK currently has more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospitals. Mr Johnson said that once the most vulnerable have been vaccinated by mid-February ""we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions"". England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Also speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said the restrictions would need to be lifted gradually by ""testing what works, and then if that works going the next step"". He said the peak of people entering hospital would be in the next week to 10 days for most places, but ""we hope"" the peak of infections ""already has happened"" in the south-east, east and London. ""The peak of deaths I fear is in the future, the peak of hospitalisations in some parts of the country may be around about now and beginning to come off the very, very top,"" he said. A ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UKcame into force on Friday morningas a result of a new, potentially more infectious variant of coronavirus linked to Brazil. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the press briefing that some of the new variants may be able to ""get round"" the Covid vaccines but it was ""really quite easy"" to adjust the vaccines to deal with mutations in the virus. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Public Health England said a total of 35 genomically confirmed and 12 genomically probable cases of the Covid-19 variant which originated in South Africa have been identified in the UK as of 14 January. Earlier, a leading scientist said one of the two variants first detected in Brazil had been found in the UK -but not the variant that was causing concern. ""I think it is likely that the vaccine we have now is going to protect against the UK variant and is going to provide protection I suspect against the other variants as well,"" said Sir Patrick. ""The question is to what degree."" How worrying are the new Covid variants? Latest figures show that more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - 3,234,946 - an increase of 316,694 from the previous day. Sir Patrick said he expected the vaccines would reduce transmission of the virus but that ""we shouldn't go mad"" as jabs are rolled out because a risk would remain. ""Just because you've been vaccinated doesn't mean you can't catch this and pass it on, it means you're protected against severe disease,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

before?"" He also ""urgently"" called for a âlonger term plan for the
airline industryâ going forward and said that the enforcement of isolation upon
arrival needs to be properly addressed, as âthe quarantine hasnât really been
policed effectively at all.â Asked if he forced former Scottish Labour Leader Richard
Leonardâs hand in resigning, Mr Starmer said he wanted to âpay tribute to
Richard and everything he achievedâ and insisted the decision was his alone. The prime minister finished a Downing Street press
conference a short time ago. He was speaking alongside England's chief medical officer
Prof Chris Whitty and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the main takeaways: Asked about reports of deliveries of vaccines being cancelled, the prime minister says the crucial thing is that everyone gets down to their vaccination centre when they get the message to come for their vaccine. ""When we have the problem of some groups or some people not getting the message or perhaps being a bit reluctant to go for one reason or another that we all work to make it clear this is a great thing to do,"" the PM says. He says local councils and public health directors will know where to find people who are hard to reach. ""We have got the Army, we've got pharmacies and we have got the NHS,"" he adds. That marks the end of the press conference. We will bring you a round-up of it shortly. More than two million people have now died with Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has recorded more fatalities than any other country, with almost 390,000 deaths, followed by Brazil and India with around 200,000 and 150,000 deaths respectively. More than 93 million infections have been recorded worldwide. The prime minister says there is ""clearly"" a problem with care home infections and the government is working ""flat-out"" to vaccinate residents and staff. About 40% of elderly residents have received jabs and the hope is that the programme will be complete by the end of January, he adds. In some areas, 80% to 90% of 80-year-olds have received vaccination offers, Boris Johnson says. Sir Patrick Vallance calls it a ""miracle"" that so many vaccines have been developed so quickly. It's too soon to see the effect on transmission yet, but it would be ""very surprising"" if they didn't have a ""decent effect"" in curbing the spread, he says. Sebastian Payne, of the Financial Times, asks what will happen to the rest of society once the most vulnerable are inoculated. Boris Johnson says it is the question which preoccupies most of us at the moment. ""Let's focus for now on getting those cohorts, the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] groups one-to-four - the over-70s, the over-80s - vaccinated and I think that will already make a huge difference,"" he says. He adds there is a ""debate to be had"" on what happens after that, ""and we will make sure everybody has a chance to have their say"". Asked again about vaccine wastage, Prof Chris Whitty says there have been ""perfectly sensible decisions made by GPs"" to maximise the delivery of vaccines, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine which needs to be stored at -70C. He says the overwhelming volume of vaccines have gone to the over-80s. Speaking earlier at the Downing Street press conference, the prime minister announced the UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Watch here: This video can not be played PM announces that the UK's travel corridors will close The threat of unidentified Covid strains from abroad means tougher action is needed, the PM says. Asked about figures on supply of vaccines and some reports of wastage, Boris Johnson says the key question is ""getting jabs into arms"". Batches have to be tested for safety, he adds, saying that the government is ""using all the supply that we can possibly lay our hands on"". Prof Chris Whitty says he has never said things will get better by Easter, adding the PM may have quoted him as saying that. But he says an improvement is likely at some point during spring. Increasingly, he predicts, the vaccine will do ""more of the heavy lifting"" in dealing with the pandemic. The situation will get ""a lot better than it is now"" in the next few months, Whitty says. Sir Patrick Vallance says a lot of work is going on to ""optimise"" workplace hygiene to prevent infections. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent There have long been calls
for the rules for people arriving into the UK to be tightened up to stop Covid cases being imported. The government only this
month introduced the requirement for proof of a negative Covid test on entry
and other countries have had stricter policies in place for months. With two prominent variants
of the virus - originating in Brazil and South Africa - already on the
governmentâs radar, ministers seem determined to get ahead of any others that
may yet pose a risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks if the move to put restrictions in at the borders is too late. The PM says the government is taking steps to protect against the new variants. ""We have a situation now where we have a very high rate of domestic infection in the UK combined with a vaccination programme,"" he says. ""There will come a point in the next weeks and months where the vaccination programme will take effect... and you will see a decline in the death rate. ""What you can't have is a situation where you have new variants with unknown qualities coming in from abroad and that's why we have set up the system to stop arrivals where new variants are a concern."" Sir Patrick Vallance says the virus is changing all the time and he suspects there are variants ""all over the world of different types"". ""The countries which have detected them first have got good sequencing,"" he says. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says some hospitals in London and south-eastern England are so busy they're having to move patients hundreds of miles and asks how the NHS is set to cope over the next few weeks. The PM says the NHS in London has been coping ""magnificently"" and intensive care units are not yet overwhelmed. There are ""tentative early signs that the pressure might be easing slightly"" in the capital but it's too early to be confident of that. Prof Chris Whitty says the hope is that infections have already peaked in some areas of the country, but the peak of hospitalisations is delayed until about a week after infections, with the peak of deaths later still. The peak of deaths is, he says, likely to be in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says the measures in place must remain in place to suppress the figures. Michael from Cornwall asks at what rate of deaths and infections the government will lift lockdown restrictions. The prime minister says the government wants to get to a stage where the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. ""Depending on the effectiveness of that roll-out, and we are hoping to do all of them by the 15 February, we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions, but it will also depend on where the disease is and what's happening,"" he says. ""We can't have any false sense of security so that we lift the restrictions all together and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations,"" Mr Johnson adds. Prof Whitty says we will not ""move from a sudden lockdown situation to nothing"". Asked about plans for any future variant that may be more easily transmissable, the PM says a lot of scientific work is being done on keeping vaccines updated. He adds that the ""tough"" measures at borders and airports will also help this effort. Sir Patrick Vallance says there's a ""very comprehensive"" method used to keep up with developments. The new UK variant transmits more readily but there's nothing to suggest it's more intense. Other variants may get round vaccines in the future, he adds, but scientists ""don't know that"". Vaccines are ""really quite easy to adjust"", thanks to recent developments, Sir Patrick adds. It's also likely that vaccines used now will protect against new variants, he says. Prof Chris Whitty stresses the need for international co-operation on vaccines to keep ahead of variants that develop. Prof Whitty says deaths will continue to rise into next week because of the lag between people going into hospital and then some dying. But he says the effects of everyone's actions will begin to reduce ""this strong pressure"" on the NHS, along with the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Exam results are likely to appear before the end of the summer term Exam results for A-levels and GCSEs in England could be published in early July this year, according to proposals for replacing cancelled exams.

"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi died in 2012 but his family pursued the posthumous appeal Scottish judges have rejected a third appeal on behalf of the Libyan man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. The family of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who died in 2012, argued that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. But the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the verdict of the original trial, which took place at special Scottish court in the Netherlands in 2001. Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted over the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988. All 259 passengers and crew on board the flight were killed, along with 11 people in Lockerbie who died when the wreckage fell onto their homes. Lockerbie: Two routes to justice Lockerbie - The town scarred by Pan Am flight 103 Lockerbie judges 'entitled' to infer Megrahi role Last month the US announcednew charges against a Libyan man who is accused of making the bomb. Abu Agila Mohammad Masud has been charged with terrorism-related crimes, and prosecutors say they will seek his extradition to stand trial in the US. Megrahi was found guilty of playing a central role in the bombing in 2001 after the trial at Camp Zeist, and lost the first appeal against his conviction the following year. He abandoned a second appeal shortly before he was released from prison in 2009 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. He returned to Libya, where he died in 2012. His family continued their efforts to ensure a further appeal against his conviction, and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commissionreferred his the case back to the courtslast year. A written judgment rejecting the appeal,externalwas delivered by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Carloway, the Lord Justice General. He said they had rejected the argument that the trial court had come to a verdict that no reasonable court could have reached. ""On the evidence at trial, a reasonable jury, properly directed, would have been entitled to return a guilty verdict,"" the judgement says. The five judges also rejected the second grounds of appeal, that the Crown failed to disclose material which would have created a real prospect of a different verdict. Lawyer Aamer Anwar said Megrahi's family were determined to fight for justice In a statement issued by lawyer Aamer Anwar, the family said they were ""heartbroken"" by the decision and would now lodge an appeal with the UK Supreme Court. He said Megrahi's son, Ali Al-Megrahi, maintained his father's innocence and was determined to clear his name. ""All the Megrahi family want for Scotland is peace and justice, but as Ali stated today their journey is not over. ""Libya has suffered enough, as has the family for the crime of Lockerbie. They remain determined to fight for justice,"" said Mr Anwar. Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the bombing, said he had believed the Scottish system would deliver ""truth and justice"" - but did not think it had done so. Kara Weipz said she was pleased with the decision to refuse the appeal ""I very much regret that we have to see whether we can go elsewhere to look for those outcomes,"" he said. However Kara Weipz, whose brother Richard Monetti was killed in the atrocity, said she was ""quite pleased"" with the decision. ""We have always had confidence in the system that it would turn out this way,"" she said. ""I don't know how many more decisions can be made that say the conviction at trial was the correct decision. ""I don't know how many more judges can confirm what was decided at Camp Zeist."" Megrahi's trial took place at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government had always been clear that the courts were the only ""appropriate forum"" to determine Megrahi's guilt or innocence. He said it did not comment or intervene in any criminal case and added that the investigation into the bombing remained ongoing. Police Scotland's Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said his thoughts remained with the families of the victims. He said the force would continue to work on its investigation along with the Crown Office, American law enforcement and other international partners. That commitment was reiterated by Scotland's top prosecutor, Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC. A total of 270 people died in the Lockerbie bombing The appeal against Megrahi's conviction was heard by five judges at the High Court in Edinburgh in November. Advocate depute Ronald Clancy, representing the Crown, said the original trial judges had been fully entitled to infer that Megrahi was involved in the bombing. He said a number of factors suggested his involvement, including his use of a false passport. Claire Mitchell QC, representing the Megrahi family, argued that evidence in relation to his identification was of ""poor quality"". She said the court had read into a mass of conflicting evidence a conclusion which was not justified. Megrahi was released from prison in 2009 on compassionate grounds US and British investigators indicted Megrahi in 1991 but he was not handed over by the Libyans until April 1999. May 2000- A special trial under Scots law starts on neutral ground at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. 31 January 2001- Former Libyan intelligence officer Megrahi is found guilty of mass murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 27 years. March 2002- Megrahi loses an appeal against his conviction. June 2007- The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) recommends that Megrahi is granted a second appeal against his conviction. 18 August 2009- Megrahi's move to drop his second appeal is accepted by judges at the High Court in Edinburgh. 20 August 2009- Megrahi, who has terminal prostate cancer,is released from prison on compassionate grounds,external. May 2012- Megrahi dies at his home in Tripoli, aged 60. July 2017- Megrahi's familylaunch a new bid to appeal against his conviction. March 2020- The Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission says Megrahi's convictioncan be taken to a fresh appeal. August 2020- The posthumous appealis given permission to proceed. January 2021- Judges uphold the verdict of the trial and reject the appeal.

"UK meat exporters have claimed post-Brexit customs systems are ""not fit for purpose"", with goods delayed for hours, sometimes days, at the border. The British Meat Processor Association said even experienced exporters were struggling with the system. It said meat exports to the EU were 25% of normal levels for this time of year. One large French meat importer told the BBC that he and his competitors were starting to look at alternative suppliers in Spain and Ireland. The BBC has contacted the government for comment. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processor Association, said: ""Fundamentally, this is not a system that was designed for a 24/7, just-in-time supply chain. ""The export health certification process was designed for moving containers of frozen meat around the world where you have a bit of leeway on time. ""No matter how much better we get at filling in the forms, it's really not fit for purpose. This is going back to the dark ages in terms of a process really, in this digital age."" He added ""It's going to be a problem for quite a time until we move forward and hopefully get a better digital system in place and can make it work a bit better, but until then, we've got to put up with all this paperwork and lorries arriving in Ireland with box files full of paper.""

""It's taking them [on the French side] up to six hours to go through the health certificates, to open up the lorry and check the goods. ""All of that is adding time and costs. It's now an extra day before our product gets into the markets of Paris."" Meanwhile, some buyers in the EU are losing patience and are beginning to consider other options. Francis Ochoa's meat company, Fory Viandes, is based in one of the world's biggest fresh produce markets - the Rungis market, south of Paris. ""The delays and extra costs mean me and my competitors in the market are obliged to start looking for other solutions,"" he says. ""One of the solutions unfortunately is to try produce from other countries, Spain for instance. Some of our competitors are ordering lambs from Ireland instead of the UK, so the consequences for UK meat and UK lambs could be disastrous."" Down at the international freight checkpoint in Ashford, near the entrance to the Eurotunnel, customs consultant Steve Cocks gave a downbeat assessment. ""The temporary border post lorry park is full, roads are being closed off and lorries are being sent back to the Covid testing site to hold them there,"" he said. ""Last week wasn't much to write home about as it was very quiet, but volumes are building and it's just going to get worse. Exports are grinding to a halt and that will affect imports, but if you are a haulier. you don't want to get a lorry stuck on this side of the Channel."" After decades of friction-free trade, there are bound to be teething problems. Indeed, the government predicted that there would be ""significant additional disruption"" as traders, officials and customers became accustomed to new procedures. However, some things cannot ""bed in"" and will become permanent features. HMRC estimates the additional cost to UK business of bog-standard customs declarations alone at Â£7bn. When buyers and sellers want to trade, they will find a way, but significant additional cost and complexity is here to stay.

"Tens of thousands of small businesses will receive insurance payouts covering losses from the first national lockdown, following a court ruling. The Supreme Court found largely in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies. For some businesses it could provide a lifeline, allowing them to trade beyond the coronavirus crisis. The ruling could cost the insurance sector hundreds of millions of pounds. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), brought the test case, with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. One of the insurers set to make significant payouts is Hiscox, which was challenged by thousands of its policyholders as part of the case. Richard Leedham, who represented the Hiscox Action Group - on behalf of small businesses, said: ""This is a landmark victory for a small group of businesses who took on a huge insurance player and have been fully vindicated. ""What is important now is that Hiscox accepts the Supreme Court's verdict and starts paying out to its policy holders, many of whom are in danger of going under"". Other insurers involved in the test case are Arch, Argenta, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA - but as many as 60 insurers sold similar products. They will now pay out on many, but not all, policies. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun. ""We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers."" In the lockdown of last spring, many small businesses made claims through business interruption insurance policies for loss of earnings when they had to close. But many insurers refused to pay, arguing only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions. It was agreed that a selection of policy wordings should be tested in court, setting the parameters for what would be considered a valid claim. The ruling provides guidance for a wider pool of 700 policies, potentially affecting 370,000 small businesses - although only some of these will end up with payouts. Giving the court's ruling, Lord Hamblen said the court accepted the arguments from representatives of policyholders and dismissed appeals from insurers against an earlier judgement finding in policyholders' favour. The complex ruling covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings. Staff outside The Drawing Room - one of the businesses affected - in happier times James Ollerenshaw's hair salon was one of those businesses unable to operate during the first national lockdown. The business - The Drawing Room in London's Spitalfields - paid an annual premium of Â£1,200 for business interruption insurance, and disease cover came as part of it. Mr Ollerenshaw said the Supreme Court's decision would not directly affect his policy, but would decide the principles on claims such as his - and were vital for the business. ""A payout would cover the major costs, which is the rent. We have debt sitting there,"" he said. He said he was delighted with the Supreme Court's ruling. ""The insurance industry needs to face up to the fact that it failed customers at their greatest moment of need, destroying companies, livelihoods and jobs,"" he said. He formed a Covid Claims Group, joining other small business owners in calling for a quick resolution and payouts. ""Time matters,"" he said, pointing out that some small businesses have been forced to close down while waiting for the decision. Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Sheldon Mills, from the FCA, which brought the case on behalf of policyholders, said: ""Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Today's judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders. ""We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible."" The test case was fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court, which heard four days of legal representations in November. The final ruling provides authoritative guidance for these policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. The FCA, the insurance sector, and the Financial Ombudsman will all use the judgement to guide their decisions in other cases. The Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. Insurance policies would have been amended for new and renewing customers since this issue emerged, so losses from the latest lockdown measures in different parts of the UK would be clearly stated as part of the cover - or not - in new business interruption insurance policies.

The 33-year-old, also from Surbiton, is charged with five offences including fraud and going outside in a tier four area without a good reason.

"""It's really scary. You don't know what you're going to face everyday,"" Lizzy tells Newsbeat. She's a student nurse and is on placement at the moment. Like many others working in a hospital right now, she's finding it tough. But the difference for Lizzy and other student nurses and midwives is they've not been getting paid. This means they don't have any insurance if they catch coronavirus either. ""There's a lot of anxiety and stress for students working unpaid placements right now. Covid is worse than it's ever been, especially with the new strain,"" Lizzy says. ""We should be paid, because without it we have no life insurance protection for death in service."" Lizzy is one of a number of students Newsbeat has spoken to, who thinks they need better protection while on placement. During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 students could either opt out of hospital placements, or join the NHS under paid contracts. This then meant they were covered by theThe NHS and Social Care Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme,externalwhich was set up in recognition of the extra risk front line workers face during the crisis, with families offered a payment of Â£60,000 if an NHS or social care worker dies from coronavirus, contracted at work. But for students, paid contracts ended in September when pressure on the health service initially eased. Yesterday the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) announced final year nursing students can be paid for placements again, but it'll be up to local governments to decide. The NMC also announced those in their first year can opt to move entirely to online or academic learning. But some students Newsbeat has been talking to say this doesn't go far enough. A student midwife - who doesn't want to be named - has raised her concerns in an open letter she's shared on social media. ""I wrote to NHS Health Education England about the fact we aren't covered by the NHS coronavirus life insurance at the moment,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""Right now, the number of cases and deaths are higher than they've been during the whole pandemic. ""So for all students who are working on placements and putting themselves at risk, there should be absolute protection."" She didn't want to give her name because she's fearful of any impact it might have, but wanted to speak out to raise awareness of the situation. ""While this latest announcement by the NMC is good news, its still not enough and we will keep pushing for action. ""For me this isn't about the money. We are so proud to be part of the NHS and want to be working and doing what we can to help in the pandemic, but we all deserve cover while we are doing it."" She says she's yet to get a response to her letter. James, who's a second year student nurse, says people like him have been at a ""massive risk."" ""If anything was to happen, we'd be left without the protections a qualified nurse would get,"" he says. ""The universities are supporting us, but there are certain limitations to what they can provide, and we need the reassurance of knowing we are protected"" The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told Newsbeat it was ""immensely grateful"" for the work of student nurses during the pandemic. ""While they are in clinical training, they should be an addition to the normal team and undertake clinical learning under supervision,"" ""Individuals who are not automatically eligible (for the Coronavirus Life Assurance scheme) can still be considered."" The DHSC says the Health and Social Care Secretary can look at individual cases when someone isn't automatically eligible. Student nurses in their third year will be given pay and protection, first years can opt out of placement But for Lizzy, she says the stress and anxiety is taking its toll, with this adding more pressure. ""It's so busy right now. We're doing long shifts and it's exhausting. At times it does feel quite overwhelming. ""Essentially we are putting our lives at risk with no backing or benefit"".

"Craig Ross had been quoted making comments about food bank users on a podcast The Scottish Conservatives have dropped a Holyrood candidate over what they called ""unacceptable comments"". Craig Ross recorded a podcast last year in which he described food bank users as being more at risk of diabetes than starvation. He also questioned the influence footballer Marcus Rashford has on UK government welfare policy. The Conservatives suspended Mr Ross, then later announced he was ""no longer a candidate or a member of the party"". The party had launched an investigation after the comments came to light, saying: ""These unacceptable comments do not reflect the views of the party."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf had called for Mr Ross to be thrown out the party and dropped as the Conservative candidate in Glasgow Pollok. Rashford and top chefs demand free school meals review The Holyrood elections are due to be held on 6 May. Mr Ross, a former lecturer at Langside College, runs a podcast in which he delivers reaction to pieces in The Guardian newspaper ""from the centre-right"". In one episode recorded in June 2020, Mr Ross talked about the percentage of body fat of ""ordinary people"". Originally reported in theDaily Record,external, his comments were in response to a Channel 4 News piece featuring foodbanks. He said: ""We have no real grasp of just how ridiculously overweight the population is. ""I'm not saying that every single person who claims to be really hungry and is reliant on charity is also very overweight. ""But what I am saying is if Channel 4 News is having a reasonable go at showing the reality of food bank usage, then we know the people that they filmed are far from starving. If anything their biggest risk is not starvation, it's diabetes."" On Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, who hascalled on Boris Johnson to review the UK government's free school meals policy, Mr Ross said: ""Has Marcus Rashford stood for election to anything? Not that I'm aware of."" Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, has supported Mr Rashford's campaign.

"This video can not be played Dutch PM Mark Rutte said in January 2021 the decision to resign was ""unavoidable"" The Dutch government has stepped down after thousands of families were wrongly accused of child welfare fraud and told to pay money back. Families suffered an ""unparalleled wrong"", MPs decided, with tax officials, politicians, judges and civil servants leaving them powerless. Many of those affected were from an immigrant background and hundreds were plunged into financial difficulty. PM Mark Rutte submitted the cabinet's resignation to the king. ""Innocent people have been criminalised and their lives ruined,"" he then told reporters, adding that responsibility for what had gone wrong lay with the cabinet. ""The buck stops here."" The ""unanimous"" decision, taken at a cabinet meeting in The Hague, comes at a key moment in the Covid-19 pandemic. The Netherlands has gone into lockdown and ministers have been considering stiffer measures to halt the spread of infection. The government will stay on in a caretaker role to tackle the pandemic until parliamentary elections in March but Economics Minister Eric Wiebes has quit with immediate effect for his role in the scandal. Asked whether the cabinet's resignation was merely symbolic, Mr Rutte was adamant that it was not. After a cabinet meeting the Dutch leader cycled to the palace to submit the government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander This is not the first time a Dutch government has resigned en masse in a gesture of collective responsibility. In 2002, the cabinet stood down after a report criticised ministers and the military for failing to prevent the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war seven years earlier. Parents were branded fraudsters over minor errors such as missing signatures on paperwork, and erroneously forced to pay back tens of thousands of euros given by the government to offset the cost of childcare, with no means of redress. They were, as one junior minister who resigned in connection with the scandal put it, ""steamrolled"" by the system. Families were left in a state of ruin, by a state apparatus that became ""the enemy of the people"". Relationships disintegrated under the pressure, homes were lost, mothers have spoken tearfully of the financial and psychological anguish they suffered after being targeted by tax officials. Last year the tax office admitted that 11,000 people were subjected to extra scrutiny simply because they had dual nationality. This confession has reinforced the widely held belief among many ethnic minorities in the Netherlands that discrimination against them is institutionalised and perpetuated by those in power. The so-called Rutte III government has been in power since 2017 and he could return to form another coalition after elections But while being seen as the responsible, honourable response - sacrificing power in an admission of government failure - the mass resignation could be interpreted as an act of self-preservation by the Rutte government that avoids the prospect of losing a no-confidence vote by MPs next week. Read Anna's report on Covid vaccinations in the Netherlands:Shocked to be Europe's vaccination stragglers The scandal began in 2012 and the number of parents involved could be as high as 26,000. Some openly called for the government to step down, saying they had lost faith in the ability of the cabinet to clean up the system. One mother faced demands to pay tax authorities around â¬48,000 (Â£42,000). She tried to explain to the authorities that mistakes had been made but officials then started withholding not just childcare allowances but other benefits too. Her rent went into arrears and energy companies refused to provide a regular supply. Eventually she lost her job and could not find another as she was seen as a fraudster. Her relationship with her child broke down as the pressure took its toll. ""Rutte says he thinks it's terrible, but he's not the one who had to pay up... This shouldn't happen in the Netherlands - I've been labelled a fraudster,"" another mother, Nazan Aydin, told NOS. Mr Rutte's liberal VVD party is performing well in the opinion polls, so the 17 March election could see another Rutte-led administration. He has already led three governments since 2010. Although he initially opposed the cabinet's resignation, it was seen as inevitable once the opposition Labour leader Lodewijk Asscher resigned on Thursday in response to the scandal. Mr Asscher was social affairs minister under the previous Rutte coalition government. Mr Rutte heads a four-party centre-right-liberal coalition and his party leads the latest opinion polls, ahead of far-right leader Geert Wilders. This video can not be played Dutch PM Mark Rutte cleared up his own mess in 2018 when he spilt coffee in the parliament building However, victims of the childcare allowance scandal who had to repay large sums paid out in benefit have this week filed a formal complaint against several current and former ministers. Compensation to the tune of at least â¬30,000 (Â£26,000) each is to be paid out to parents who were wrongly accused, but many have argued it is not enough. Ahead of the government's decision to step down, Sigrid Kaag, the leader of the liberal D66 party said it was ""important to be politically accountable and to take responsibility for the content of the report and for the injustice done to the parents"". State Secretary for Finance Alexandra van Huffelen said children caught up in the fraud scandal should also be looked after so they could ""soon move on"".

"US president-elect Joe Biden has been given his new official presidential Twitter account, but has been forced to start it with zero followers. The Biden campaign is unhappy with the move, which marks a change from the previous transition from Barack Obama. The new account, @PresElectBiden, will transform into the official @POTUS (President of the United States) one on inauguration day on 20 January. In its first six hours online it gained nearly 400,000 followers. Mr Biden's own account has 24 million followers. His team has also registered new accounts - @FLOTUSBiden for the future first lady, Jill Biden, and for the first time, @SecondGentleman, for Ms Harris's husband Doug Emhoff.

Anyone flying into the country from overseas will have to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off. It comes as aban on travellers from South America and Portugalcame into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. Boris Johnson said the new rules would be in place until at least 15 February. A further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291. The latest government figures on Friday,externalalso showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported - up from 48,682 the previous day. Meanwhile, more than two million people around the world have now died with the virus since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.,external What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Scotland to suspend travel corridors from Monday Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said it was ""vital"" to take extra measures now ""when day by day we are making such strides in protecting the population"". ""It's precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country."" All travel corridors will close from 04:00 GMT on Monday.,externalAfter that, arrivals to the UK will need to quarantine for up to 10 days, unless they test negative after five days. Mr Johnson, who said the rules would apply across the UK after talks with the devolved administrations, added that the government would be stepping up enforcement at the border and in the country. Travel corridors were introduced in the summer to allow people travelling from some countries with low numbers of Covid cases to come to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival. Trade body Airlines UK said it supported the latest restrictions ""on the assumption"" that the government would remove them ""when it is safe to do so"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said travel corridors were ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the ""right step"" but called the timing of the decision ""slow again"", adding that the public would be thinking ""why on earth didn't this happen before"". The prime minister warned that the NHS was facing ""extraordinary pressures"", having had the highest number of hospital admissions on a single day of the pandemic earlier this week. He said that came on Tuesday when there were 4,134 new admissions, while the UK currently has more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospitals. Mr Johnson said that once the most vulnerable have been vaccinated by mid-February ""we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions"". England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Also speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said the restrictions would need to be lifted gradually by ""testing what works, and then if that works going the next step"". He said the peak of people entering hospital would be in the next week to 10 days for most places, but ""we hope"" the peak of infections ""already has happened"" in the south-east, east and London. ""The peak of deaths I fear is in the future, the peak of hospitalisations in some parts of the country may be around about now and beginning to come off the very, very top,"" he said. A ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UKcame into force on Friday morningas a result of a new, potentially more infectious variant of coronavirus linked to Brazil. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the press briefing that some of the new variants may be able to ""get round"" the Covid vaccines but it was ""really quite easy"" to adjust the vaccines to deal with mutations in the virus. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Public Health England said a total of 35 genomically confirmed and 12 genomically probable cases of the Covid-19 variant which originated in South Africa have been identified in the UK as of 14 January. Earlier, a leading scientist said one of the two variants first detected in Brazil had been found in the UK -but not the variant that was causing concern. ""I think it is likely that the vaccine we have now is going to protect against the UK variant and is going to provide protection I suspect against the other variants as well,"" said Sir Patrick. ""The question is to what degree."" How worrying are the new Covid variants? Latest figures show that more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - 3,234,946 - an increase of 316,694 from the previous day. Sir Patrick said he expected the vaccines would reduce transmission of the virus but that ""we shouldn't go mad"" as jabs are rolled out because a risk would remain. ""Just because you've been vaccinated doesn't mean you can't catch this and pass it on, it means you're protected against severe disease,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The UK's epidemic is still officially estimated to be growing, according to the latest R number, but data suggests new cases are beginning to fall. The R number - which takes into account cases, hospitalisations and deaths - is estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.3, compared with 1 and 1.4 last week. This suggests the total number of people with the virus is still rising across the UK. But in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower. In the capital, the estimate - based on data up until 11 January - is between 0.9 and 1.2, compared with 1.1 and 1.4 the previous week. It comes as a further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291. The latest government figures on Friday,externalalso showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported. Meanwhile, more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - latest figures show the number at 3,234,946. What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? Covid patients moved from London to Newcastle North-east England leads over-80s vaccination race Although the number of people sick with coronavirus is growing in the UK, data from various sources suggests new infections are declining. This provides early signs that lockdown restrictions may be taking effect. The government's scientific advisory group Sage, which calculates the R number, said areas that have been under tougher restrictions for a longer period of time - including east of England, London, and the south east - are showing ""a slight decline in the number of people infected"". However, they warned that regions such as north-west and south-west England continue to see infections rise, where the spread of the new UK variant may be playing a role. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. In theory, it describes the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus onto, on average. In reality, though, the government's estimate of R gives a wider view of the epidemic's general trend since it also looks at what is happening in hospitals. Cases, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 have been alarmingly high since the beginning of the year and the latest estimate of the R number indicates that the pandemic is continuing to grow. But because of the way the data to estimate R is collected - it reflects the situation a week ago. More up to date indicators suggest that there's a slight decline in infections in the east of England, London, and the South East. These areas have had the highest prevalence and therefore the toughest restrictions the longest but infections are continuing to rise in the North West and South West probably because of the spread of the new variant of the virus. Despite this there's some relief at these figures among the government's scientific advisors.  They were not sure whether the current restrictions would be enough to prevent the more contagious variant getting out of control. Now they expect Covid-related deaths to level off in a week or so and then decline as the benefits of the vaccine programme begin to take effect. Cases should also begin to decrease in the coming weeks. But all this depends on people continuing to observe the government's social distancing guidelines - and come into contact with others only if it is essential. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said coronavirus deaths were likely to peak in the next week to 10 days. He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One that the lockdown measures were having an impact, with the peak in infections having passed ""a good few days ago"" which would lead to a reduction in the numbers dying from the disease. ""They are likely to level off in a week - 10 days maybe - at a peak which is probably going to be bigger than the first wave peak of 1,000-a-day, but then should decline due the reductions in cases that we are seeing and, of course, the vaccine programme."" Data from the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app gives its own estimate of 0.9 for the virus's R or reproduction number. This is based on cases alone, rather than a wider number of data sources included in the official estimate. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? While this leaves out the fact that hospitals are still filling up, looking at cases on their own allows assessment of whether lockdown restrictions are working. But the large number of infections recorded at the end of December and the beginning of January means, despite receding cases, hospitalisations and deaths will inevitably continue to rise for some time. Meanwhile, a ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UK came into force on Friday as a result of a new, potentially more infectious strain linked to Brazil. Prof Wendy Barclay, a scientist at Imperial College London advising the government, saidthis ""variant of concern"" had not been detected in the UKbut another variant from Brazil was already in circulation. It is not clear whether this second strain is more contagious or not.

"Tens of thousands of small businesses will receive insurance payouts covering losses from the first national lockdown, following a court ruling. The Supreme Court found largely in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies. For some businesses it could provide a lifeline, allowing them to trade beyond the coronavirus crisis. The ruling could cost the insurance sector hundreds of millions of pounds. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), brought the test case, with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. One of the insurers set to make significant payouts is Hiscox, which was challenged by thousands of its policyholders as part of the case. Richard Leedham, who represented the Hiscox Action Group - on behalf of small businesses, said: ""This is a landmark victory for a small group of businesses who took on a huge insurance player and have been fully vindicated. ""What is important now is that Hiscox accepts the Supreme Court's verdict and starts paying out to its policy holders, many of whom are in danger of going under"". Other insurers involved in the test case are Arch, Argenta, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA - but as many as 60 insurers sold similar products. They will now pay out on many, but not all, policies. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun. ""We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers."" In the lockdown of last spring, many small businesses made claims through business interruption insurance policies for loss of earnings when they had to close. But many insurers refused to pay, arguing only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions. It was agreed that a selection of policy wordings should be tested in court, setting the parameters for what would be considered a valid claim. The ruling provides guidance for a wider pool of 700 policies, potentially affecting 370,000 small businesses - although only some of these will end up with payouts. Giving the court's ruling, Lord Hamblen said the court accepted the arguments from representatives of policyholders and dismissed appeals from insurers against an earlier judgement finding in policyholders' favour. The complex ruling covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings. Staff outside The Drawing Room - one of the businesses affected - in happier times James Ollerenshaw's hair salon was one of those businesses unable to operate during the first national lockdown. The business - The Drawing Room in London's Spitalfields - paid an annual premium of Â£1,200 for business interruption insurance, and disease cover came as part of it. Mr Ollerenshaw said the Supreme Court's decision would not directly affect his policy, but would decide the principles on claims such as his - and were vital for the business. ""A payout would cover the major costs, which is the rent. We have debt sitting there,"" he said. He said he was delighted with the Supreme Court's ruling. ""The insurance industry needs to face up to the fact that it failed customers at their greatest moment of need, destroying companies, livelihoods and jobs,"" he said. He formed a Covid Claims Group, joining other small business owners in calling for a quick resolution and payouts. ""Time matters,"" he said, pointing out that some small businesses have been forced to close down while waiting for the decision. Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Sheldon Mills, from the FCA, which brought the case on behalf of policyholders, said: ""Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Today's judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders. ""We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible."" The test case was fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court, which heard four days of legal representations in November. The final ruling provides authoritative guidance for these policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. The FCA, the insurance sector, and the Financial Ombudsman will all use the judgement to guide their decisions in other cases. The Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. Insurance policies would have been amended for new and renewing customers since this issue emerged, so losses from the latest lockdown measures in different parts of the UK would be clearly stated as part of the cover - or not - in new business interruption insurance policies.

"""It's really scary. You don't know what you're going to face everyday,"" Lizzy tells Newsbeat. She's a student nurse and is on placement at the moment. Like many others working in a hospital right now, she's finding it tough. But the difference for Lizzy and other student nurses and midwives is they've not been getting paid. This means they don't have any insurance if they catch coronavirus either. ""There's a lot of anxiety and stress for students working unpaid placements right now. Covid is worse than it's ever been, especially with the new strain,"" Lizzy says. ""We should be paid, because without it we have no life insurance protection for death in service."" Lizzy is one of a number of students Newsbeat has spoken to, who thinks they need better protection while on placement. During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 students could either opt out of hospital placements, or join the NHS under paid contracts. This then meant they were covered by theThe NHS and Social Care Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme,externalwhich was set up in recognition of the extra risk front line workers face during the crisis, with families offered a payment of Â£60,000 if an NHS or social care worker dies from coronavirus, contracted at work. But for students, paid contracts ended in September when pressure on the health service initially eased. Yesterday the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) announced final year nursing students can be paid for placements again, but it'll be up to local governments to decide. The NMC also announced those in their first year can opt to move entirely to online or academic learning. But some students Newsbeat has been talking to say this doesn't go far enough. A student midwife - who doesn't want to be named - has raised her concerns in an open letter she's shared on social media. ""I wrote to NHS Health Education England about the fact we aren't covered by the NHS coronavirus life insurance at the moment,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""Right now, the number of cases and deaths are higher than they've been during the whole pandemic. ""So for all students who are working on placements and putting themselves at risk, there should be absolute protection."" She didn't want to give her name because she's fearful of any impact it might have, but wanted to speak out to raise awareness of the situation. ""While this latest announcement by the NMC is good news, its still not enough and we will keep pushing for action. ""For me this isn't about the money. We are so proud to be part of the NHS and want to be working and doing what we can to help in the pandemic, but we all deserve cover while we are doing it."" She says she's yet to get a response to her letter. James, who's a second year student nurse, says people like him have been at a ""massive risk."" ""If anything was to happen, we'd be left without the protections a qualified nurse would get,"" he says. ""The universities are supporting us, but there are certain limitations to what they can provide, and we need the reassurance of knowing we are protected"" The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told Newsbeat it was ""immensely grateful"" for the work of student nurses during the pandemic. ""While they are in clinical training, they should be an addition to the normal team and undertake clinical learning under supervision,"" ""Individuals who are not automatically eligible (for the Coronavirus Life Assurance scheme) can still be considered."" The DHSC says the Health and Social Care Secretary can look at individual cases when someone isn't automatically eligible. Student nurses in their third year will be given pay and protection, first years can opt out of placement But for Lizzy, she says the stress and anxiety is taking its toll, with this adding more pressure. ""It's so busy right now. We're doing long shifts and it's exhausting. At times it does feel quite overwhelming. ""Essentially we are putting our lives at risk with no backing or benefit"".

"One of two coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil has been found in the UK, says a leading scientist advising the government. But the version discovered is not the ""variant of concern"", Prof Wendy Barclay clarified. The ""variant of concern"" from Brazil, detected in travellers to Japan, is thought to be more infectious. It led to travellers from South America and Portugal being banned from entering the UK on Friday. Prof Wendy Barclay, who is heading a newly-launched project to study the effects of emerging coronavirus mutations called the G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, said: ""There are two different types of Brazilian variants and one of them has been detected and one of them has not."" Prof Barclay, who also sits on Nervtag, a committee which advises government on new and emerging respiratory virus threats, said the variant was ""probably introduced some time ago"" and it ""will be being traced very carefully"". She added: ""The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK. ""Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found."" The body which collects and analyses the genomes of virus samples - Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (Cog-UK) - said this variant seen in the UK contained one of the mutations found in the Brazilian ""variant of concern"". The mutation, also found in the South African variant, has been linked to a reduced antibody response meaning our bodies might be less able to fight it off. Cog-UK said this alone was not enough to qualify it as a ""variant of concern"", thought it acknowledged ""no internationally agreed definition of a variant of concern has yet been agreed"". In other variants of concern, the mutation sits alongside a ""constellation"" of others which together amount to a high chance of making the virus more transmissible. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Which countries are included in the UK travel ban? Coronavirus variants: The science explained It comes as a further 1,248 people with coronavirus have died in the UK. The latest government figures on Thursday also showed another 48,682 new cases had been reported. Meanwhile, the latest estimate for the reproduction (R) number in the UK - which represents the average number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to -is between 1.2 and 1.3. Last week it was estimated at between 1 and 1.4 by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. When the figure is above 1, the number of cases increases exponentially. Despite other variants entering the country since, the Kent variant remains dominant in the UK and is believed to be 30-50% more infectious than the previous form of the virus. Viruses acquire random changes to their genes constantly as they replicate. Many are neutral or even hurt the virus's ability to spread, but those that give it an advantage will become more common. Mutations are being detected now because enough time has passed for those random changes to take hold. Even though there is no evidence any of these mutations make the virus more deadly, a virus that infects more people is likely to have a higher death toll. When the virus gets better at sticking onto and breaking into human cells, in theory someone exposed to the same dose is more likely to become ill. The use of masks and personal protective equipment, social distancing and hand washing remain the best defences against the virus's spread. Downing Street said current evidence did not suggest the concerning Brazilian variant affected vaccines or treatment. This video can not be played Grant Shapps explained the ban to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Mr Shapps described the travel ban, which came into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday, as a ""precautionary"" measure. It covers people who have travelled from or through, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days. The ban also applies to Portugal - because of its strong links to Brazil - and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa, as well as Panama in central America. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights are still allowed to return - but must isolate for 10 days. Also exempt are hauliers who are travelling from Portugal to transport essential goods. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Dr Mike Tildesley, an epidemiologist who is part of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said the travel ban should minimise the risk from a ""more transmissible"" variant. ""We always have this issue with travel bans, of course, that we're always a little bit behind the curve,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""My understanding is that there haven't really been any flights coming from Brazil for about the past week, so hopefully the immediate travel ban should really minimise the risk."" Downing Street said it acted ""as quickly as possible"" to impose the travel ban because the concerning Brazilian variant ""could pose a significant risk to the UK"". However, Portugal's government has described the ban as ""absurd"" and illogical"". The country's minister of foreign affairs Augusto Santos Silva said he had requested a conversation with his British counterpart after the ""sudden and unexpected"" suspension of flights. He added Portugal was already restricting flights from Brazil and there was ""no evidence"" the new variant existed in his country.

"David Chambers denied five charges at Westminster Magistrates Court A man accused of allegedly tricking a 92-year-old woman out of Â£160 for a fake coronavirus vaccination has been charged with fraud and common assault. David Chambers is accused of administering the fake vaccine at her Surbiton home in London last month. The 33-year-old, also from Surbiton, is charged with five offences including fraud and going outside in a tier four area without a good reason.

"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as England was placed in lockdown for a second time, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said,externalit meant gross domestic product was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak. November's decline came after six consecutive months of growth. Pubs and hairdressers were badly hit as the service sector suffered, the ONS said, but some manufacturing and construction activity improved. The hit to the service sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy - meant it contracted by 3.4% in November, and is now 9.9% below the level of February 2020. Some economists said the November figure was better than expected, and it appeared many companies were better prepared for the second lockdown, with some sectors staying open for business and many firms having already put in place plans to expand online operations. ""Steps taken by businesses earlier in the year to Covid-proof their operations - combined with the time-limited nature of the restrictions, and schools remaining open - meant more companies were able to continue trading safely,"" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI employers' group. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed ""it's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face"". But he said the vaccine roll-out and economic support measures meant there were reasons to be hopeful. ""With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the figures showed the UK has an economic ""mountain to climb"". Speaking to the BBC, she said it would be a ""serious mistake"" if Mr Sunak waited until the Budget in March before providing more support and confidence for business. ONS director for economic statistics Darren Morgan said: ""The economy took a hit from restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic during November, with pubs and hairdressers seeing the biggest impact."" However, he said many firms adjusted to the new pandemic working conditions, such as by expanding click and collect and other online operations. He added: ""Manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, while schools also stayed open, meaning the impact on the economy was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown. ""Car manufacturing, bolstered by demand from abroad, housebuilding and infrastructure grew and are now all above their pre-pandemic levels."" Construction activity grew by 1.9% during the month. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Despite the GDP figure being better than some analysts had forecast, there are still concerns that the UK could be heading back into recession. Economists have warned the UK could see a double-dip recession if restrictions remain in place in the first three months of 2021. Rory Macqueen, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the November figures confirm a significant slowdown in the last quarter of 2020, ""despite November's lockdown in England clearly having a far smaller effect than the first"". James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said there would be a lot of comment about whether these figures point to the UK heading for only its second-ever double-dip recession on record. But, he said, the real ""story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure"". ""The chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease,"" he added. Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' Analysts at Capital Economics also said there was cause for optimism, saying that the current third lockdown could have less impact than feared. ""The economy has built up a fair bit of immunity to lockdowns, as November's lockdown was much less painful for the economy than the first lockdown. ""As a result, the Covid-19 economic hole is smaller than we thought, the economy may get back to its pre-crisis crisis level a bit sooner and it makes us more confident that the Bank of England probably won't resort to negative interest rates."" The fall in the economy in November was still considerable, but the figures show businesses adapting to difficult conditions. The hit was a fraction of what occurred in the first lockdown last April, and was mainly confined to the service sector, with pubs and hairdressing for example in sharp decline. Manufacturing and construction largely remained open, as did previously shut public services such as schools. By November car manufacturing and house building were back above the level of output before the pandemic. The trade figures also showed a Â£7bn increase in EU imports in the three months to November as traders stockpiled car parts, medicines and other goods ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period. The renewed regional tiered restrictions in December, and more severe national lockdowns this month, still indicate a possible return to overall recession in this tough winter. Business groups continue to argue that extra support is required to support jobs and cash flow well before the Budget in March. But a more sustained lifting of restrictions as vaccines are rolled out should see growth return after the spring. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"This video can not be played At Fullwell Cross Medical Centre, north London, they are now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Fake news is likely to be causing some people from the UK's South Asian communities to reject the Covid vaccine, a doctor has warned. Dr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive, said it was ""a big concern"" and officials were working ""to correct so much fake news"". He said language and cultural barriers played a part in the false information. A GP in the West Midlands told the BBC some of her South Asian patients had refused the vaccine when offered it. Dr Sood, from NHS England, said officials were working with South Asian role models, influencers, community leaders and religious leaders to help debunk myths about the vaccine. Much of the disinformation surrounds the contents of the vaccine. He said: ""We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine, it has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities."" ""We're trying to find role models and influencers and also thinking about ordinary citizens who need to be quick with this information so that they can all support one another because ultimately everyone is a role model to everyone"", he added. ""There's a big piece of work happening where we're translating information, we're making sure the look and feel of it reaches the populations that matter."" WhatsApp rumours fear over BAME vaccine take up Clinics urge Asian community to take up vaccine The vaccines explained in five South Asian languages Some of the disinformation seen by the BBC on social media and on WhatsApp is religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims, as does eating beef for Hindus. Dr Samara Afzal has been vaccinating people in Dudley, West Midlands. She said: ""We've been calling all patients and booking them in for vaccines but the admin staff say when they call a lot of the South Asian patients they decline and refuse to have the vaccination. ""Also talking to friends and family have found the same. I've had friends calling me telling me to convince their parents or their grandparents to have the vaccination because other family members have convinced them not to have it"". Reena Pujara is a beauty therapist in Hampshire and a practising Hindu. She said she's been bombarded with false information. ""Some of the videos are quite disturbing especially when you actually see the person reporting is a medic and telling you that the vaccine is going to alter your DNA,"" she said. ""For a layman it is very confusing. And also when you read that the ingredients in the vaccine derive from a cow - and as Hindus the cow is sacred to us - it is disturbing."" About 100 mosques have a joined a campaign to counter vaccine disinformation and persuade their communities to take the vaccine. They've said they'll use their Friday sermons to urge people to have the jab. ""There should be no hesitation in taking [the vaccine] from a moral perspective,"" said Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB), which has organised the campaign. ""It is our ethical duty to protect ourselves and others from harm."" Why 'disappearing' vaccine needles aren't a scam No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Asian Network that faith and community leaders had a big role to play in ensuring a high take-up of the vaccine. He said he had met with more than 150 leaders from Sikh, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim communities who were taking the message out ""that it's the right thing to do"". He added that the government was taking steps to tackle online disinformation around the vaccine, as well as making sure vaccine guidance was available in many different languages. A recent poll, commissioned by the Royal Society of Public Health, suggested just over half of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people would be happy to have the coronavirus vaccine. It found 57% said they would take the vaccine - compared with 79% of white people.

"The government is assessing the impact of a ""technical issue"" that led to 150,000 records being deleted from police databases. The error,first reported in the Times,,externalsaw data including fingerprint, DNA and arrest histories wiped after being accidentally flagged for deletion. The Home Office said the lost entries related to people who were arrested and then released without further action. But Labour said it presented ""huge dangers"" for public safety. The data was lost from the Police National Computer - a system that stores and shares criminal records information across the UK. It is used to help police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. A coding error resulted in records that had been flagged for deletion being lost from the database before checks had been carried out to determine whether they could be lawfully held or not. The data loss could hinder future police investigations because the fingerprint or DNA evidence would not be able to be cross-checked against evidence from other crime scenes. Policing minister Kit Malthouse said the problem had been identified and the process corrected so ""it cannot happen again"" - with the Home Office, National Police Chiefs' Council and other law enforcement partners working ""at pace"" to recover the data. ""While the loss relates to individuals who were arrested and then released with no further action, I have asked officials and the police to confirm their initial assessment that there is no threat to public safety,"" he said. The Home Office said no records of criminal or dangerous persons had been deleted. The records are linked to police investigations that were terminated before charge (No Further Action or NFA cases) or to those where an individual had been acquitted at court. It is not yet known how many records of each type were lost and full extent of deletions is still being investigated. The loss of the data means that officers on the ground may get an incomplete search result when interrogating the system. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had. ""She must urgently make a statement about what has gone wrong, the extent of the issue, and what action is being taken to reassure the public. Answers must be given."" ""This is an extraordinarily serious security breach that presents huge dangers for public safety."" Former Cumbria Police chief constable Stuart Hyde told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""very large"" loss of arrest records presented a ""risk to public safety"". He said: ""In order to understand the scale, if you think that about between 6-700,000 people are arrested every year in the UK, that's a very large proportion of those people.""

"The guitarist also contributed songwriting and piano to the band's explosive debut album Sylvain Sylvain, guitarist with trailblazing 1970s rock band New York Dolls, has died at the age of 69. One of the group's founding members, his visceral riffs bridged the divide between punk and glam, and helped kick-start the punk and new wave movements. ""As most of you know, Sylvain battled cancer for the past two and 1/2 years,"" his wife, Wanda O'Kelley Mizrahi,wrote in a statement,externalon his Facebook page. ""Though he fought it valiantly, yesterday he passed away."" She added: ""While we grieve his loss, we know that he is finally at peace and out of pain. Please crank up his music, light a candle, say a prayer and let's send this beautiful doll on his way."" Sylvain's death leaves only one surviving member of the New York Dolls' original line-up from their 1973 debut album, frontman David Johansen. The singerposted his own tribute on Instagram,external. ""My best friend for so many years, I can still remember the first time I saw him bop into the rehearsal space/bicycle shop with his carpetbag and guitar straight from the plane after having been deported from Amsterdam, I instantly loved him,"" he wrote. ""I'm gonna miss you old pal. I'll keep the home fires burning."" The New York Dolls bridged the gap between glam rock and punk Born Sylvain Mizrahi in Cairo, Egypt, on Valentine's Day 1951, the musician lived in France as a child before moving to New York with his family. After playing in several bands as a teenager, he co-founded the New York Dolls in 1971, taking the name from a doll repair shop called the New York Doll Hospital (Sylvain had worked across the street before becoming a musician). Like the punk movement they helped inspire, the band wanted to shake up the self-indulgent state of 70s rock. ""The reason why the Dolls got together was because of the boredom with the norm of the day, which was like the stadium-rock era,""Sylvain told Brooklyn Vegan in 2006,external. ""The 20-minute drum solos, songs that were a big operetta. They were sort of boring, they'd lost their sex appeal."" The Dolls cut through with urgent, punchy songs about sex, drugs, alienation and dysfunction. The band's provocative and vulgar live shows gained them a huge following in New York, but many record labels were reluctant to sign them. That situation not helped by their androgynous look - shocking at the time - with their wardrobe sourced from cheap women's clothing stores on New York's Lower East Side. Late in 1972, tragedy struck when, during a tour of England, Dolls drummer Billy Murcia died in a drug-related accident. He was replaced by Jerry Nolan, after which the Dolls finally secured a contract with Mercury Records. Their debut album, simply called New York Dolls, stalled at number 113 in the US chart but is now regarded as a classic, full of sleazy, raucous anthems like Personality Crisis and Trash. Rolling Stone magazine recently named it one of the500 Greatest Albums of All Time,external, writing: ""Glammed-out punkers the New York Dolls snatched riffs from Chuck Berry and Fats Domino and fattened them with loads of attitude and reverb. ""It's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them."" Sylvain worked in fashion before becoming a musician However, the band's lack of commercial success saw them dropped after two albums and, despite hiring Sex Pistols guru Malcolm McLaren as a manager, eventually fell apart. Outside the Dolls, Sylvain toured and recorded with several bands and led various solo projects as his former band's reputation grew. Artists from the Sex Pistols to Guns N' Roses cited them as an influence, and Morrissey was famously president of their UK fan club before forming The Smiths. In 2004, the singer reunited his idols for a show at London's Meltdown Festival, adding an unexpected second act to their career. Over the subsequent decade, Sylvain and Johansen, the only remaining members, released three well-received albums. In 2019, Sylvain announced his cancer diagnosis, and a GoFundMe was set up to pay his medical bills, raising $79,500 (Â£58,000). The band are cited as an influence by hundreds of musicians Guitarist Lenny Kaye, best known for playing with Patti Smith, paid tribute to Sylvain's ""heart, belief, and the way you whacked that E chord"". Kaye wrote on Facebook,external: ""Syl loved rock and roll. ""His onstage joy, his radiant smile as he chopped at his guitar, revealed the sense of wonder he must have felt at the age of 10, emigrating from his native Cairo with his family in 1961, the ship pulling into New York Harbor and seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time. ""His role in the band was as lynchpin, keeping the revolving satellites of his bandmates in precision. ""Though he tried valiantly to keep the band going, in the end the Dolls' moral fable overwhelmed them, not before seeding an influence that would engender many rock generations yet to come.""

"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: Are supermarkets following the rules? New laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after ""significant evidence"" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said shops would have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance. It comes after customers and staff raised concerns over safety, with some workers saying they had faced abuse. Mr Drakeford said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant. Speaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said the Test, Trace, Protect scheme had shown there was ""no doubt at all"" transmission was taking place in supermarkets. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Pharmacy 'first in Wales to offer Covid jab' Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die But he also said: ""I don't want anybody to get the idea that supermarkets are dangerous places - supermarkets are safe places and we're incredibly grateful to all those brave members of staff who have been in there, providing face-to-face services to members of the public since the very beginning of the pandemic. ""We want to make sure that they are even safer."" Wales remains under a level four ""stay at home"" lockdown, meaning people are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including shopping for food. But there have been growing concerns from shoppers and staff about safety in supermarkets and Mr Drakeford previously said one-way systems and number limits in stores appeared to have broken down. Supermarkets have been told to block off aisles with 'non-essential' items Some workers have claimed they are seeing shoppers walking around without masks, not using hygiene measures and shopping in large groups. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said many shops already had safety measures in place, including providing hand sanitisers, limiting numbers in store and reminding people to socially distance. The first minister said laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people in ""many communities"" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year. Mr Drakeford said people needed to see everything was ""being done to keep them safe"" and give them the ""necessary confidence... to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown."" Under the laws, set to come into force early next week, all retailers will need to have: signs visible to help people keep their distance and make their way around the store sanitiser available for hands and trolleys systems in place to limit the number of people who can be in store at any one time These measures were already guidance, but will now be law, and supermarket owners and managers will be responsible for ensuring the new rules are followed. ""Many [shops] are already operating high standards and we need to raise the bar for those who could and should improve,"" Mr Drakeford said. Some shop workers had told BBC Wales they were facing ""daily abuse"" for challenging rule-breakers, with some threatened and spat at. The Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) has warned the onus on policing customers' behaviour must not fall on shop workers. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets While Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium said trying to enforce laws had created ""further conflict and flashpoint"" with customers, leading to workers being abused. ""We ask that all customers play their part in keeping our stores safe, shopping alone where possible, following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers,"" she said. ""We also ask that government considers legislating for better protections for shop workers, as is being planned in Scotland."" Mr Drakeford said it was ""entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic"" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions.Staff had been ""going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table"", he said. Nick Ireland, regional secretary for Usdaw for Wales and the south west of England, said shop workers were anxious about confronting customers not adhering to guidance in shops. 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries? ""We've asked for clearer signage, and robust one way systems,"" he said. ""Some shoppers seem to forget about two metre social distancing, particularly when it comes the workforce in stores."" Health spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said new rules for shops were ""overdue"". He said it was ""certainly the right thing to do"", and was ""totally unacceptable for any supermarket staff to be the subject of any abuse over this"". Meanwhile, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""quite clear that we are lagging behind other parts of the UK"" in regards to numbers of people vaccinated. ""It's important to get those vaccines out to people and get the vaccines into people's arms,"" he added. Mr Drakeford said enforcement action could be taken against supermarkets over breaches of Covid rules. During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations. ""Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,"" he said. ""They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require."" The first minister said there was also the ""wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers"". ""I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,"" Mr Drakeford added. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?

"This video can not be played Biden: 'I promise we will not forget you' President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus plan for the coronavirus-sapped US economy before he takes office next week. If passed by Congress, it would include $1tn for households, with direct payments of $1,400 to all Americans. The relief proposal includes $415bn to fight the virus and $440bn for small businesses. Mr Biden, a Democrat, has promised to beat the pandemic that has killed more than 385,000 people in the US. He campaigned last year vowing to do a better job handling the virus than outgoing President Donald Trump, a Republican. The direct payments of $1,400 would come on top of $600 payments provided in a relief bill enacted last month. Mr Biden's proposal comes as a winter surge of the coronavirus breaks records. Each day brings well over 200,000 new cases in the US and the daily death toll sometimes tops 4,000. US faces bleak winter amid worst Covid wave yet How much can Joe Biden get done on the US economy? In a primetime speech on Thursday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, he said: ""A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there's no time to waste."" ""The very health of our nation is at stake,"" he added. ""We have to act and we have to act now."" The incoming president said: ""There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet."" Mr Biden wants to pump $20bn into vaccinating Americans, including setting up mass vaccination hubs and dispatching mobile units to remote areas. Two effective vaccines were delivered under the Trump administration, but health officials say the rollout needs to speed up. ""The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,"" said Mr Biden. His administration aims to deliver 100 million jabs in 100 days. So far,about 11 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US,external, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His plan also calls for $50bn to expand testing and $130bn to help most schools reopen by the spring. The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers for contact tracing. By BBC Reality Check US officials have acknowledged that the vaccination programme has not been working as smoothly as planned,external, and a goal to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020 was not met. ""We know that it should be better, and we're working hard to make it better,"" said Moncef Slaoui, who leads the government's vaccine rollout plan, at the end of December. President Trump has deflected attention onto the states to deliver the jabs - telling them to ""get moving"" - but there has also been criticism of the level of government support given to local health authorities. And there have been issues around getting sufficient supplies to vaccinations centres, as well as co-ordination and preparedness at the state level. There are wide variations in vaccination rates: South Dakota has administered more than 6,000 doses per 100,000 people, and Alabama fewer than 2,000. When you look at vaccine doses per head in the countries doing the most vaccinations, the US is currently fourth. With nearly 11 million people unemployed across the country, supplemental jobless benefits would increase to $400 a week from $300 a week now. They would also be extended until September, along with a moratorium on evictions and home repossessions. The proposal would bring payouts for families to the $2,000 figure that both Mr Biden and Mr Trump called for. Lady Gaga to sing at Joe Biden's inauguration What Joe Biden wants to do The president-elect will also call on Congress to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour - a Democratic priority that predates the pandemic. Republicans are likely to object to piling up trillions more in debt that the US has already incurred to tackle the pandemic, and the incoming president acknowledged his plan ""does not come cheaply"". But he will be helped by his fellow Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress, if only by narrow margins. Trump faces Senate trial after historic charge The beginning of Mr Biden's term, however, will take place against the backdrop of a US Senate impeachment trial for his predecessor. It is unclear how quickly the Senate will proceed - or whether it will vote to convict President Trump - but the drama is expected to prove a distraction from the Biden agenda.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un has been overseeing a huge military showcase broadcast by state media in North Korea North Korea has unveiled a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile, described by state media as ""the world's most powerful weapon"". Several of the missiles were displayed at a parade overseen by leader Kim Jong-un, reported state media. The weapon's actual capabilities remain unclear, as it is not known to have been tested. The show of military strength comes days before the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president. It also follows a rare political meeting where Mr Kim decried the US as his country's ""biggest enemy"". Images released by North Korean state media showed at least four large black-and-white missiles being driven past flag-waving crowds. North Korea throws the gauntlet down for Biden Kim vows to expand North Korea's nuclear arsenal North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Profile: Kim Jong-un Analysts noted it was a previously unseen weapon. ""New year, new Pukguksong,"" tweeted North Korea expert Ankit Panda, using the North Korean name for their submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Clad in a leather coat and fur hat, Mr Kim is pictured smiling and waving as he watched the display in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, which also included infantry troops, artillery and tanks. The missile was debuted at a military parade which came at the end of an important and rare political meeting ""The world's most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missile, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces,"" the official Korean Central News Agency said. The event on Thursday did not showcase North Korea's largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),which was unveiled at a much larger military parade in October. That colossal weapon is believed to be able to deliver a nuclear warhead to anywhere in the US, and its size had surprised even seasoned analysts when it was put on show last year. What we know about North Korea's huge new missile The country's latest display of its arsenal comes at the end of a five-yearly congress of the ruling Workers' Party. In his address to members last week, Mr Kim had pledged to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons and military potential, outlining a list of desired weapons including long-range ballistic missiles capable of being launched from land or sea and ""super-large warheads"". He also said that the US was Pyongyang's ""biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy... no matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change"". Under Mr Kim's leadership North Korea has made rapid progress in its weapons programme, which it says is necessary to defend itself against a possible US invasion. The unveiling of the new missiles appears designed to send the incoming Biden administration a message of the North's growing military prowess, say experts. ""They'd like us to notice that they're getting more proficient with larger solid rocket boosters,"" Mr Panda tweeted, noting what appeared to be new solid-fuel short-range ballistic missiles on display too. These missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuelled varieties. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Over the last four years, Pyongyang has had an erratic relationship with the US under President Donald Trump's administration. Mr Kim and Mr Trump engaged in mutual insults and threats of war before an unprecedented summit in Singapore in 2018 anddeclarations of love by the outgoing US leader. Despite the apparent warming of relations, little concrete progress was made on negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme anda second summit in Hanoi in 2019 broke down after the US refused Pyongyang's demands for sanctions relief. Kim Jong-un has had a busy week. In this rare party congress at the start of a new year he's earned a new title, pledged to build new nuclear weapons and now he's shown the world some new missiles. The general secretary, the title posthumously awarded to his father by which he is now known, had been pretty quiet in 2020 and appeared very few times in state media. But 2021 is looking rather different. The party congress has offered him a grand daily domestic platform - even if it is not getting the international attention it may have done due to events in the United States and a global pandemic. The parading vehicles include a new submarine-launched ballistic missile and new short-range ballistic missiles. This is a show of strength - flexing the military muscle once more to show the people of North Korea that despite the current bleak economic outlook, this impoverished country is capable of designing and building new strategic weapons. It also offers a direct challenge to the incoming US administration. North Korea appears willing to continue with its self-imposed isolation and being subject to strict economic sanctions, and the state has vowed to continue to build nuclear weapons in defiance of the international community. During the transfer of power, President Obama told Donald Trump that North Korea should be his top national security concern. In the last four years a combination of US and UN sanctions, so-called ""maximum pressure"" policies and three summits between Mr Trump and Mr Kim have done nothing to alleviate those concerns. Kim Jong-un has shown the new US president this week that he faces the daunting prospect of coming up with new solutions for this decades-old problem.

"Tens of thousands of small businesses will receive insurance payouts covering losses from the first national lockdown, following a court ruling. The Supreme Court found largely in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies. For some businesses it could provide a lifeline, allowing them to trade beyond the coronavirus crisis. The ruling could cost the insurance sector hundreds of millions of pounds. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), brought the test case, with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. One of the insurers set to make significant payouts is Hiscox, which was challenged by thousands of its policyholders as part of the case. Richard Leedham, who represented the Hiscox Action Group - on behalf of small businesses, said: ""This is a landmark victory for a small group of businesses who took on a huge insurance player and have been fully vindicated. ""What is important now is that Hiscox accepts the Supreme Court's verdict and starts paying out to its policy holders, many of whom are in danger of going under"". Other insurers involved in the test case are Arch, Argenta, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA - but as many as 60 insurers sold similar products. They will now pay out on many, but not all, policies. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun. ""We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers."" In the lockdown of last spring, many small businesses made claims through business interruption insurance policies for loss of earnings when they had to close. But many insurers refused to pay, arguing only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions. It was agreed that a selection of policy wordings should be tested in court, setting the parameters for what would be considered a valid claim. The ruling provides guidance for a wider pool of 700 policies, potentially affecting 370,000 small businesses - although only some of these will end up with payouts. Giving the court's ruling, Lord Hamblen said the court accepted the arguments from representatives of policyholders and dismissed appeals from insurers against an earlier judgement finding in policyholders' favour. The complex ruling covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings. Staff outside The Drawing Room - one of the businesses affected - in happier times James Ollerenshaw's hair salon was one of those businesses unable to operate during the first national lockdown. The business - The Drawing Room in London's Spitalfields - paid an annual premium of Â£1,200 for business interruption insurance, and disease cover came as part of it. Mr Ollerenshaw said the Supreme Court's decision would not directly affect his policy, but would decide the principles on claims such as his - and were vital for the business. ""A payout would cover the major costs, which is the rent. We have debt sitting there,"" he said. He said he was delighted with the Supreme Court's ruling. ""The insurance industry needs to face up to the fact that it failed customers at their greatest moment of need, destroying companies, livelihoods and jobs,"" he said. He formed a Covid Claims Group, joining other small business owners in calling for a quick resolution and payouts. ""Time matters,"" he said, pointing out that some small businesses have been forced to close down while waiting for the decision. Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Sheldon Mills, from the FCA, which brought the case on behalf of policyholders, said: ""Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Today's judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders. ""We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible."" The test case was fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court, which heard four days of legal representations in November. The final ruling provides authoritative guidance for these policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. The FCA, the insurance sector, and the Financial Ombudsman will all use the judgement to guide their decisions in other cases. The Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. Insurance policies would have been amended for new and renewing customers since this issue emerged, so losses from the latest lockdown measures in different parts of the UK would be clearly stated as part of the cover - or not - in new business interruption insurance policies.

"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as England was placed in lockdown for a second time, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said,externalit meant gross domestic product was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak. November's decline came after six consecutive months of growth. Pubs and hairdressers were badly hit as the service sector suffered, the ONS said, but some manufacturing and construction activity improved. The hit to the service sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy - meant it contracted by 3.4% in November, and is now 9.9% below the level of February 2020. Some economists said the November figure was better than expected, and it appeared many companies were better prepared for the second lockdown, with some sectors staying open for business and many firms having already put in place plans to expand online operations. ""Steps taken by businesses earlier in the year to Covid-proof their operations - combined with the time-limited nature of the restrictions, and schools remaining open - meant more companies were able to continue trading safely,"" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI employers' group. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed ""it's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face"". But he said the vaccine roll-out and economic support measures meant there were reasons to be hopeful. ""With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the figures showed the UK has an economic ""mountain to climb"". Speaking to the BBC, she said it would be a ""serious mistake"" if Mr Sunak waited until the Budget in March before providing more support and confidence for business. ONS director for economic statistics Darren Morgan said: ""The economy took a hit from restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic during November, with pubs and hairdressers seeing the biggest impact."" However, he said many firms adjusted to the new pandemic working conditions, such as by expanding click and collect and other online operations. He added: ""Manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, while schools also stayed open, meaning the impact on the economy was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown. ""Car manufacturing, bolstered by demand from abroad, housebuilding and infrastructure grew and are now all above their pre-pandemic levels."" Construction activity grew by 1.9% during the month. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Despite the GDP figure being better than some analysts had forecast, there are still concerns that the UK could be heading back into recession. Economists have warned the UK could see a double-dip recession if restrictions remain in place in the first three months of 2021. Rory Macqueen, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the November figures confirm a significant slowdown in the last quarter of 2020, ""despite November's lockdown in England clearly having a far smaller effect than the first"". James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said there would be a lot of comment about whether these figures point to the UK heading for only its second-ever double-dip recession on record. But, he said, the real ""story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure"". ""The chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease,"" he added. Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' Analysts at Capital Economics also said there was cause for optimism, saying that the current third lockdown could have less impact than feared. ""The economy has built up a fair bit of immunity to lockdowns, as November's lockdown was much less painful for the economy than the first lockdown. ""As a result, the Covid-19 economic hole is smaller than we thought, the economy may get back to its pre-crisis crisis level a bit sooner and it makes us more confident that the Bank of England probably won't resort to negative interest rates."" The fall in the economy in November was still considerable, but the figures show businesses adapting to difficult conditions. The hit was a fraction of what occurred in the first lockdown last April, and was mainly confined to the service sector, with pubs and hairdressing for example in sharp decline. Manufacturing and construction largely remained open, as did previously shut public services such as schools. By November car manufacturing and house building were back above the level of output before the pandemic. The trade figures also showed a Â£7bn increase in EU imports in the three months to November as traders stockpiled car parts, medicines and other goods ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period. The renewed regional tiered restrictions in December, and more severe national lockdowns this month, still indicate a possible return to overall recession in this tough winter. Business groups continue to argue that extra support is required to support jobs and cash flow well before the Budget in March. But a more sustained lifting of restrictions as vaccines are rolled out should see growth return after the spring. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"One of two coronavirus variants first detected in Brazil has been found in the UK, says a leading scientist advising the government. But the version discovered is not the ""variant of concern"", Prof Wendy Barclay clarified. The ""variant of concern"" from Brazil, detected in travellers to Japan, is thought to be more infectious. It led to travellers from South America and Portugal being banned from entering the UK on Friday. Prof Wendy Barclay, who is heading a newly-launched project to study the effects of emerging coronavirus mutations called the G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, said: ""There are two different types of Brazilian variants and one of them has been detected and one of them has not."" Prof Barclay, who also sits on Nervtag, a committee which advises government on new and emerging respiratory virus threats, said the variant was ""probably introduced some time ago"" and it ""will be being traced very carefully"". She added: ""The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK. ""Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found."" The body which collects and analyses the genomes of virus samples - Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (Cog-UK) - said this variant seen in the UK contained one of the mutations found in the Brazilian ""variant of concern"". The mutation, also found in the South African variant, has been linked to a reduced antibody response meaning our bodies might be less able to fight it off. Cog-UK said this alone was not enough to qualify it as a ""variant of concern"", thought it acknowledged ""no internationally agreed definition of a variant of concern has yet been agreed"". In other variants of concern, the mutation sits alongside a ""constellation"" of others which together amount to a high chance of making the virus more transmissible. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? Which countries are included in the UK travel ban? Coronavirus variants: The science explained It comes as a further 1,248 people with coronavirus have died in the UK. The latest government figures on Thursday also showed another 48,682 new cases had been reported. Meanwhile, the latest estimate for the reproduction (R) number in the UK - which represents the average number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to -is between 1.2 and 1.3. Last week it was estimated at between 1 and 1.4 by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. When the figure is above 1, the number of cases increases exponentially. Despite other variants entering the country since, the Kent variant remains dominant in the UK and is believed to be 30-50% more infectious than the previous form of the virus. Viruses acquire random changes to their genes constantly as they replicate. Many are neutral or even hurt the virus's ability to spread, but those that give it an advantage will become more common. Mutations are being detected now because enough time has passed for those random changes to take hold. Even though there is no evidence any of these mutations make the virus more deadly, a virus that infects more people is likely to have a higher death toll. When the virus gets better at sticking onto and breaking into human cells, in theory someone exposed to the same dose is more likely to become ill. The use of masks and personal protective equipment, social distancing and hand washing remain the best defences against the virus's spread. Downing Street said current evidence did not suggest the concerning Brazilian variant affected vaccines or treatment. This video can not be played Grant Shapps explained the ban to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Mr Shapps described the travel ban, which came into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday, as a ""precautionary"" measure. It covers people who have travelled from or through, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days. The ban also applies to Portugal - because of its strong links to Brazil - and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa, as well as Panama in central America. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights are still allowed to return - but must isolate for 10 days. Also exempt are hauliers who are travelling from Portugal to transport essential goods. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Dr Mike Tildesley, an epidemiologist who is part of the government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said the travel ban should minimise the risk from a ""more transmissible"" variant. ""We always have this issue with travel bans, of course, that we're always a little bit behind the curve,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""My understanding is that there haven't really been any flights coming from Brazil for about the past week, so hopefully the immediate travel ban should really minimise the risk."" Downing Street said it acted ""as quickly as possible"" to impose the travel ban because the concerning Brazilian variant ""could pose a significant risk to the UK"". However, Portugal's government has described the ban as ""absurd"" and illogical"". The country's minister of foreign affairs Augusto Santos Silva said he had requested a conversation with his British counterpart after the ""sudden and unexpected"" suspension of flights. He added Portugal was already restricting flights from Brazil and there was ""no evidence"" the new variant existed in his country.

"Northern Ireland's statistics agency has recorded its highest weekly Covid-19 related registered deaths since the pandemic began. Nisra said 145 deaths were registered in the first week of 2021, although administrative delays over Christmas may have affected the number. That brings the agency's death toll to 1,976 by 8 January. The figures come as the chief medical officers from NI and the Republic issued a joint stay-at-home plea. Dr Michael McBride and Dr Tony Holohan said they were ""gravely concerned"" about the ""unsustainably high level of Covid-19 infection"" across the island of Ireland. Concern was raised in the Republic of Ireland this week as figures showedit has the world's highest number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases per million people. On Friday evening, the Irish Department of Health reported 50 further deaths with Covid-19 and 3,498 new cases of the virus. More than half (54%) of those newly diagnosed are under the age of 45. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week. Visiting suspended in NI hospitals due to Covid Minister tells big retail to stop non-essential trade NI to introduce international travel Covid tests However, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service. Of the 2,019 deaths recorded by Nisra by 8 January, 1,247 (62%) occurred in hospital, 622 (31%) in care homes, 12 (0.6%) in hospices and 138 (7%) at residential addresses or other locations. People aged 75 and over account for just over three-quarters of all Covid-19 related registered deaths (77.6%) between 19 March 2020 and 8 January 2021. Just over a fifth (22.2%) of all Covid-19 related registered deaths have been of people with an address in the Belfast council area. Meanwhile, the Department of Health reported 26 further Covid-related deaths on Friday. Five of these deaths did not occur in the past 24 hours. The Department of Health bases its figures on a positive test result being recorded, whereas Nisra figures are based on mentions of the virus on death certificates, so people may or may not have been confirmed to have contracted the virus prior to death. A further 1,052 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 and 63 patients are being treated in intensive care units, 47 of whom are on ventilators. The chief medical officers warned the high infection rate was having a ""significant impact"" on the health of the population and the ""safe functioning"" of the healthcare systems. They said the public should avoid all unnecessary journeys, including cross-border travel. Pointing out that many of the patients admitted to hospital in January have been younger than 65, they warned coronavirus could affect anyone, ""regardless of age or underlying condition"". ""It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home,"" said the medical officers. Northern Ireland's spike in infections has been put down to an easing of restrictions over Christmas. Asked if he regretted being part of the decision to ease restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann said the executive had tried to be balanced in its approach. ""I regret the pressures we see now in our hospitals, but let's remember it's caused by this virus, we have it in our power to bring it back under control and get us back to where we were in the summer,"" he told BBC News NI on Friday. Mr Swann pleaded with people to follow the current restrictions. ""We're in the middle of a very tough six-week scenario, and how we come out of this will be a more graduated approach to make sure we get the benefits of what we've already done, and also the benefits of the vaccine.""

"Footballer Marcus Rashford has led campaigns over child poverty Marcus Rashford and a group of celebrity chefs and campaigners have called on Boris Johnson to review the government's free school meals policy. The group, including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge,have written to the PM,externalasking him to ""fix"" the system long-term. They called for a strategy to help ""end child food poverty"" before the summer holidays. No 10 said ""no child will ever go hungry"" because of the Covid pandemic. The call for a wide review comes after another row over free school mealsduring February half-term. The government has said food will be provided to children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme while schools are closed for the holiday. Councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the Local Government Association's Councillor Richard Watts telling BBC Radio 4's PM programme the grant had already been allocated for other support. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are down to semantics whether it is the school delivering the meal or whether it is the local authority - fortunately there is quite a lot of different support available."" What should be in free school meals? Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel How many children need free meals? As well as getting the backing of Rashford - who has led campaigns around child poverty over the course of the pandemic - the letter has been signed by chefs Oliver, Kerridge and Fearnley-Whittingstall, along with actor Dame Emma Thompson and over 40 charities and education leaders. Organised by the Food Foundation charity,the letter,externalsaid it was time to ""step back and review the policy in more depth"". They called for an ""urgent comprehensive review into free school meal policy across the UK"" to feed into the government's next Spending Review, saying it should look at: the threshold for being eligible for free school meals funding - including whether the current allowance is enough how schools can be helped to provide the best quality meals the impact of Covid on children in low-income families making sure there is no stigma The signatories praised the Department for Education's ""swift response"" toreports earlier this week of inadequate food parcels sent to families, saying the ""robustness of the message from you and the secretary of state on this issue was very welcome"". But, they added that ""following the series of problems which have arisen over school food vouchers, holiday provision and food parcels since the start of the pandemic"", now was the time for a review. This video can not be played Tom Kerridge: There has to be a solution to free school meals Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen ""crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals"". ""The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing."" Chef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. ""We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,"" he told the same programme. The signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. ""We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,"" the letter said. ""School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. ""Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step."" Anti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: ""We need to be feeding children right now."" She added: ""While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. ""This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon. ""School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of the most disadvantaged pupils. The prime minister has been clear that no child will ever go hungry as a result of the pandemic"".

"Scotland's education secretary has warned it will be a ""tall order"" for schools to return on 1 February. But John Swinney said it was ""premature"" to give a definitive view ahead of a formal decision next week. Schools are currently closed to the majority of pupils because of concerns about the new strain of Covid, with remote learning being used instead. Mr Swinney hinted the current arrangements could be extended given the continued prevalence of the virus. Asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme whether he thought schools would fully reopen on 1 February, he said: ""I think that's a tall order to be honest."" He added: ""The government will look at these questions at the Cabinet on Tuesday and the first minister will give an update to parliament, but the virus is still at a very high level in general within society and we took the view that we had to have the level of community transmission suppressed to enable us to protect the NHS."" Mr Swinney, who is also the deputy first minister, said it would be premature for him to give a decision at this stage, but that the government's overriding priority was ""keeping everyone in our society safe."" Pupils in Scotland struggle to get online amid Microsoft issue Parents' verdicts on week one of home-schooling Where are the latest cases? The Scottish government is expected to make an announcement in the Scottish Parliament about when schools will reopen on Tuesday. The majority of Scottish school pupils are learning from home, with a combination of set tasks and online sessions with teachers. Some vulnerable pupils and children of key workers are able to attend school where they are supervised by teaching staff. On Mondaya number of schools, pupils and parents reported problems with the Microsoft Teamssoftware used for live learning. Mr Swinney said the issue was due to a Europe-wide Microsoft fault that had now been fixed. He said: ""The services have been up and running well since Tuesday and we've seen a very significant increase in the usage of Microsoft Teams, which I think illustrates that the teaching profession has spent a great deal more time delivering live learning to young people. ""I accept remote learning is a real challenge, particularly for parents who are working as well, but generally it's got off to a very good start."" During the first lockdown Donna Bruce, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, juggled a full-time job and working from home while looking after her two children, Kai, 10, and eight-year-old Quinn. She didn't have enough devices for all three of them, and she had to occupy the children for seven hours a day while working at the same time. Her early Zoom meetings enjoyed guest appearances from half-naked children climbing kitchen cupboards to find snacks. Quinn and Kai got off to a good start after technical issues across the UK with Microsoft This time round, she feels schools and teachers were better prepared. ""Teachers had made videos talking to the children and reassuring them,"" she said. ""I feel there is less pressure this time on parents and children, but children still need supervised and their time still needs occupied to allow parents to work and that's when the issues come in."" Mr Swinney acknowledged that he was worried about the impact that the disruption caused by Covid will have on attainment levels in what he described as a ""terribly tough year"" for pupils. He said: ""I can't sit here and say remote learning in the current environment, and the school year we're going through, is the ideal school year. ""It is far from ideal and I worry about the impact on the wellbeing of young people."" Scottish Conservatives education spokesman, Jamie Greene MSP, said the Scottish government needed ""to reassure parents that they have a clear plan on how and when pupils can get back into classrooms"". He added: ""The closure of schools has placed a huge burden on both parents and teachers, and they deserve clarity as soon as possible. ""More on-site and regular Covid testing was promised but never materialised, and this will be essential to getting kids behind their desks again."" One parents' group has also raised concerns about ""equal and fair access to home learning"" and it has called on the Scottish government to set minimum standards.

"This video can not be played ""I'm not going to be going into those assessments with the same sort of opportunities as everybody else"" An A-level student has started a campaign to scrap any external exam assessments in Wales this year, calling for grades to be decided by teachers. Pupils are unlikely to return to any classroom learning in Wales until the end of January at the earliest. Cai Parry, who is 17 and cares for a family member, said the thought of any external tests was ""panic-inducing"". The Welsh Government said its exams advisory group was considering how to adapt plans set outbefore Christmas. More than 6,000 people have so far signed a petition calling on the Welsh Government to cancel externally set and marked assessments for A-levels and GCSEs in 2021. Online education 'patchy and inconsistent' Plea to end remote teaching 'postcode lottery' Cai, who lives in Cardiff and hopes to study politics at university next year, said he was concerned the ""quality of learning"" for pupils had been so varied that it would be unfair to expect students to sit externally set assessments. ""I'm a child carer. And the time I've had to put into that has gone up a lot because of pandemic and it's got to a point where it's really interfering with my ability to study,"" he said. ""I'm not going to be going into those assessments with the same sort of opportunities as everybody else and it's not going to result in me having a fair grade."" He added that there needed to be a system that considered the ""varying circumstances"" in which pupils were studying. AS-level student Manon Clarke thinks the Welsh Government's plans were originally a good idea, but circumstances have changed Manon Clarke, a 17-year-old AS-level pupil from Cardiff who wants to study medicine at university, is backing the campaign. She said pupils in ""more vulnerable situations"" and ""who don't have the same facilities to learn online"" were disadvantaged. Although she does not blame her school or teachers, she also does not feel she has ""reached far enough"" in the courses to sit any assessments. ""I think that whilst they were originally a good idea, now with the circumstances... I don't think that's a good idea at all."" In December, Wales' Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed the details of a plan under which students would receive grades based on a mix of internal and external assessments, rather than end-of-year exams. But following the announcement of the move to full-time remote learning earlier this month, exams regulator Qualifications Walescancelled the spring period of ""internal assessments""for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which would have been marked by teachers and had been scheduled between 22 February and 23 April. However, the external assessments, which will be set and marked by the exam board, are still scheduled to take place between 17 May and 29 June. In England, the government has announced that teachers'estimated grades would be used, although Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has since suggested that some external""mini exams"" are being considered. The Scottish equivalents to GCSE and A levels will be teacher-assessed, while Northern Ireland has also cancelled all GCSE, AS and A-level exams this year. Plaid Cymru has reiterated its calls for the external tests to be scrapped, and now want an urgent decision to change to teacher-assessed grades, also known as ""centre-assessed"". Education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said this would be ""sensible, practical and fair"" and a ""a perfectly legitimate alternative system"". ""The children have had so much disruption to their education already this year and some children have had more disruption than others,"" she said. The chief executive of the WJEC, Wales' exam board, said there were ""no easy decisions [or] outcomes"". Ian Morgan said the decision to cancel exams in England ""does have a broader impact right across the UK"", but that they would push forward with an agenda that suits learners in Wales. ""What we need is to make sure that there's consistency in the process, that everybody is treated fairly and that the level of content and the level of assessment of learners get, is fair and balanced across the board,"" he added. A Welsh Government official said following the shift to full-time remote learning its advisory group would now be considering how to ""build on and adapt"" the proposals to ""support learner wellbeing and progression"". ""The minister is also discussing with stakeholders including young people and will provide a further update as soon as possible,"" they said.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Supermarkets in Wales will be required by law to limit the number of shoppers amid concerns about Covid safety Another 54 people in Wales have died with coronavirus, although the figures show case rates are falling A pharmacy in Gwynedd is the first in Wales to offer Covid jabs, as community vaccine trials begin An A-level student starts a campaign to scrap any external exam assessments in Wales this year, calling for grades to be decided by teachers Lola Mayor and Andy Roberts That's all from our live blog of the latest Welsh Government update on the pandemic. The main points today:  You can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Stay safe, and have a good weekend. BBC Wales political editor Felicity Evans and political correspondent James Williams chew over the week in Welsh politicsin a new series of podcasts. In the week that Health Minister Vaughan Gething announced his vaccine strategy for Wales, Felicity and Williams take a closer look at what's in it, whoâs eligible, and the potential challenges the Welsh Government face in reaching its milestones. They also hear from BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke about how the Welsh NHS is coping during the pandemic, and ponder whether the Senedd elections in May could be postponed. A Wales Covid-19 Evidence Centre is being establishedto ""shape"" the Welsh Government's response to the pandemic. The centre will have an initial budget of Â£3m over two years from this month. Wellbeing minister Eluned Morgan decided to establish the centre to ""provide a Welsh-specific programme of research, evidence synthesis and knowledge mobilisation"". But an opposition Senedd member says resources should be concentrated at a UK level rather than ""duplicating"". Mark Reckless, who represents the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party, suggested Wales ""would surely benefit more by being part of a UK coronavirus evidence centre with a budget of, say, Â£60m"". This video can not be played Supermarkets in Wales have been told they will now berequired by law to conform to Covid safety measures, including risk assessments. This comes after criticism that some stores were not following the rules. Earlier this week, BBC Wales journalists were able to purchase ""non-essential"" items, including men's clothing and children's toys. As Wales remains in lockdown and the school gates are shut,here's are reminder of what you need to know. The seven-day Covid case rate for Wales as a whole is now the lowest it has been since 6 December, but some parts are still hit hard by the virus, including Wrexham and the south Wales Valleys, Figures published on Friday show there were also 1,808 new Covid infections reported in Wales, taking the total number of cases since he pandemic began to 177,864. At least 4,171 people are now known to have died in Wales with the virus. But case rates in areas hit hard by the virus, including Wrexham and the south Wales Valleys, are starting to show signs of improving, Public Health Wales said. Supermarkets are ""very unhappy"" when enforcement action is taken against them for breaches of coronavirus rules because of the potential damage to their reputation, says the first minister. Mark Drakeford told at Friday's press conference: ""Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains. ""They definitely don't like it, or wouldn't want it, when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require."" He said there was ""peer pressure between supermarkets to make sure yours isn't the one that is highlighted in that way"". There was also the ""wish of the sector to do the right thing by their staff and their customers"", Mr Drakeford said. ""I think is more effective than financial penalties, which are there and have been applied to supermarkets,"" he added. Earlier this week the Local Democracy Reporting Service revealed that a Tesco Extra store in Talbot Green, near Llantrisant, was ordered to do moreto stop the sale of non-essential items. Rhondda Cynon Taf council officers found adult clothing for sale while shoppers ""pushing past"" stands to get to restricted aisles were not stopped. A Tesco Extra store in Talbot Green, near Llantrisant, was found to be selling non-essential items Betsi Cadwaladr health board in north Wales has record numbers of patients in critical care with Covid-19. There were 29 in critical care or on invasive ventilation in its hospitals on Thursday, and 30 on Wednesday. These are the highest numbers the board has seen in the pandemic so far. Across Wales, there were 135 Covid patients in critical care, slightly down on the week before. The total number of patients in Welsh hospitals with the virus is 2,727 - on a daily average this is 73 more than the week before. Numbers hit record levels on Tuesday. More than a third of all hospital patients have Covid and itâs nearly half of patients in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan health board areas. Hospital admissions remain at about the same levels as last week, according to NHS Wales figures. It is âclear weâre lagging behindâ the rest of the UK in Covid vaccinations, according to the leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd. Paul Davies said: ""Itâs certainly not happening quickly enough - we need to see the Welsh Government stepping up to the plate. âWeâve heard from the first minister that 126,000 people have now received their first dose of the vaccine in Wales. ""But we know from the Welsh Governmentâs action plan that 327,000 doses of the vaccine have been received here in Wales, and thatâs why itâs important now to get those vaccines out now to people.â The coronavirus situation in Wales is improving but far too slowly, in the view of Plaid Cymru. Health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: âIf we can focus on the role community pharmacies can play, I donât think we can refer to whatâs happening in Nefyn as the start of a roll-out - thatâs one pharmacy out of 600 community pharmacies in Wales. âAs important as it is that we have one pharmacy doing it, whatâs happening in all the others?  We understand only one health board has even asked pharmacies for expressions of interest in getting involved in the vaccination process. ""How on earth are we in this position in mid-January?â  Public Heath Wales has reported 54 more deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales, taking the official total to 4,171. Of those deaths: Some ""marginal easements"" may be possible within level four restrictions, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said while it may not be possible to go from the current level four restrictions straight to level three, ""it is possible to make some adjustments"". But he stressed that hospital admissions will not improve immediately. ""We certainly won't see reductions in hospital occupation moving as fast as the community falls because we know there's always a delay."" He added: ""I think it's important to remember is that even within levels, it is possible to make some adjustments. ""So even if you're not able to go from level four to level three, within level four it may be possible, and it's a 'may'  - I really want to stress that it is a 'may - it may be possible to have some marginal easements that would demonstrate to people that the efforts that they are making are making a difference"". Covid laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people, Wales' first minister says. Mark Drakeford said at Friday's press conference there were concerns in ""many communities"" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year. ""That has an undermining effect on their confidence - I'm not sure that those places are doing everything that they could be,"" he said. ""Some of this is just about making all that visible again to people so that people can see everything that is being done to keep them safe, and to give them the necessary confidence then to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown."" Wales' first minister has confirmed he chaired a meeting with people across the education sector yesterday, discussing the future of schools. Lessons have been online since the alert level four lockdown was announced in Wales. Mark Drakeford confirmed the Welsh Government is ""committed to working together to put measures in place that will allow return of greater numbers of our young people to face to face learning"". ""We all want children to be back in the classroom, but we all want that to be done in a way that is safe for them and for the staff that work with them and support them"". Schools in Wales are not due to fully reopen before the beginning of February, and not before half-term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid rates, the Welsh Government has said. A ""reliable"" and ""sustainable"" improvement in Wales' situation will be needed before lockdown restrictions can be eased, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford confirmed that the next review would be carried out as promised on January 29. ""If things over the next two weeks continue to head in the right direction, then the cabinet will decide whether there is any headroom for us to begin the process of lessening the current level of restrictions that we all face"", he said. But Mr Drakeford also reminded the public of the situation in the Republic of Ireland which went from ""the best to the worst position in the world"" in three weeks. ""We would have to be certain that that improvement is reliable, sustainable in order for us to begin that journey of lifting the restrictions,"" he said. ""We want to do that as soon as it is safe to do so, but it will have to be safe."" There is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakefordâs comments came as he announcedstricter rules for shops. He said Walesâ Test, Trace and Protect scheme showed there was âno doubt at allâ that transmission was taking place in supermarkets. The first minister added that whilst âthe majority of supermarkets have worked very hardâ to make their shops âas safe as possibleâ, the visible signs of protection âhave been reducedâ compared to last spring. âI think it is very important in giving confidence to staff and to people who go shopping that that a more visible sense that everything is being done to protect them is put back in its place,â Mr Drakeford said. Better protections for shop workers need to be considered by the Welsh Government, says the head of the Welsh Retail Consortium. It follows the announcement thatstore managers will be required by law to ensure that Covid safety guidelines are observed. Sara Jones said shops were already delivering the new measures, which include risk assessments, screens at tills and social distancing. âSage data has always
highlighted that retail is a safe environment, and shops have spent hundreds of
millions on safety measures,"" she said. ""Customers should be
reassured that grocers and supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit
during lockdown and beyond."" âRetail workers have
played a vital role in keeping Wales fed and supplied during the pandemic. ""That has increased the pressure on those
workers to enforce legislation on customers, creating further conflict and
flashpoints which have led to workers being abused."" Chris DeardenBBC Wales News Patients have been arriving in a steady flow at a community pharmacy in Llanbedrog, Gwynedd,the first in Wales to offer coronavirus vaccinesby appointment. Rosie Bennett, who lives in the village Pwllheli, said: âIâm 82 and donât have a car, so it was a huge relief to know that I wouldnât have to travel a long distance to have the vaccine. âHere in the village, we know the staff at the chemists.  Theyâve been doing a great job during the pandemic and itâs reassuring to have the vaccine from someone you know. âAnd itâs a huge relief to be vaccinated.  The last few months havenât been easy for any of us and hopefully today is another small step towards a better future.â Steffan John, pharmacist on duty, gave Rosie the vaccine and said: âas pharmacists, we give out flu vaccines regularly, so weâre used to organising clinics like this. âWeâre really pleased to do our bit for our community. âWe have had extra training for today, and we also have to make sure there are enough appointments on the list. ""The vaccine comes in vials of ten doses, so itâs important to vaccinate that many people at a time and not to waste any.â Pharmacist Steffan John gave Rosie Bennett her Covid jab Supermarket owners and managers in Wales will be responsible for ensuring the new tighter Covid regulations are observed, the first minister says. Speaking at Friday's press conference Mark Drakeford said it was ""entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic"" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions. Staff had been ""going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table"", he said. Answering questions from journalists, Mr Drakeford said: ""We've worked closely with trade unions in reaching the conclusions that I've outlined this morning. ""None of this is designed to put those people at any greater risk."" Brendon WilliamsBBC News The health board withthe worst child obesity rates in Walesis setting up a unit to tackle the issue. Data from the Child Measurement Programme showed 30.3% of four and five-year-olds in north Wales measured as overweight or obese. The Welsh average is 26.4%, but doctors fear this could worsen in the pandemic. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board is recruiting a dietetic lead for a new children's healthy weight management service. The service is not being launched directly because of the pandemic, but there are fears lockdowns and school closures could compound the problem. Dr Naomi Simmons, consultant paediatrician at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan, said: ""It's that lack of routine, it's being out of school, and not being able to access their usual forms of physical activity.""

"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: Are supermarkets following the rules? New laws for shoppers and staff are to be introduced after ""significant evidence"" coronavirus is being spread in supermarkets, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said shops would have to install signs reminding shoppers to socially distance. It comes after customers and staff raised concerns over safety, with some workers saying they had faced abuse. Mr Drakeford said the stricter measures were needed due to the new variant. Speaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said the Test, Trace, Protect scheme had shown there was ""no doubt at all"" transmission was taking place in supermarkets. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Pharmacy 'first in Wales to offer Covid jab' Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die But he also said: ""I don't want anybody to get the idea that supermarkets are dangerous places - supermarkets are safe places and we're incredibly grateful to all those brave members of staff who have been in there, providing face-to-face services to members of the public since the very beginning of the pandemic. ""We want to make sure that they are even safer."" Wales remains under a level four ""stay at home"" lockdown, meaning people are only allowed to leave home for essential reasons, including shopping for food. But there have been growing concerns from shoppers and staff about safety in supermarkets and Mr Drakeford previously said one-way systems and number limits in stores appeared to have broken down. Supermarkets have been told to block off aisles with 'non-essential' items Some workers have claimed they are seeing shoppers walking around without masks, not using hygiene measures and shopping in large groups. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said many shops already had safety measures in place, including providing hand sanitisers, limiting numbers in store and reminding people to socially distance. The first minister said laws for supermarkets were being strengthened because of concerns of people in ""many communities"" that safety measures were not as visible as they were in the earlier stages of the pandemic last year. Mr Drakeford said people needed to see everything was ""being done to keep them safe"" and give them the ""necessary confidence... to be able to use places which are, after all, pretty vital to most of us to keep our lives going in a lockdown."" Under the laws, set to come into force early next week, all retailers will need to have: signs visible to help people keep their distance and make their way around the store sanitiser available for hands and trolleys systems in place to limit the number of people who can be in store at any one time These measures were already guidance, but will now be law, and supermarket owners and managers will be responsible for ensuring the new rules are followed. ""Many [shops] are already operating high standards and we need to raise the bar for those who could and should improve,"" Mr Drakeford said. Some shop workers had told BBC Wales they were facing ""daily abuse"" for challenging rule-breakers, with some threatened and spat at. The Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) has warned the onus on policing customers' behaviour must not fall on shop workers. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets While Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium said trying to enforce laws had created ""further conflict and flashpoint"" with customers, leading to workers being abused. ""We ask that all customers play their part in keeping our stores safe, shopping alone where possible, following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers,"" she said. ""We also ask that government considers legislating for better protections for shop workers, as is being planned in Scotland."" Mr Drakeford said it was ""entirely unacceptable that retail staff who have done so much to help us or during this pandemic"" should face abuse from customers unhappy with the restrictions.Staff had been ""going into work every day to make sure that there's food that we can put on the table"", he said. Nick Ireland, regional secretary for Usdaw for Wales and the south west of England, said shop workers were anxious about confronting customers not adhering to guidance in shops. 'Loads of shoppers breaking rules' in supermarkets Supermarkets: 'We're lucky if people wear masks' How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries? ""We've asked for clearer signage, and robust one way systems,"" he said. ""Some shoppers seem to forget about two metre social distancing, particularly when it comes the workforce in stores."" Health spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said new rules for shops were ""overdue"". He said it was ""certainly the right thing to do"", and was ""totally unacceptable for any supermarket staff to be the subject of any abuse over this"". Meanwhile, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was ""quite clear that we are lagging behind other parts of the UK"" in regards to numbers of people vaccinated. ""It's important to get those vaccines out to people and get the vaccines into people's arms,"" he added. Mr Drakeford said enforcement action could be taken against supermarkets over breaches of Covid rules. During the first lockdown some stores were issued with fines for failing to adhere to regulations. ""Reputation does really matter to supermarket chains,"" he said. ""They definitely don't like it... when one of their supermarkets becomes known locally as somewhere that was regarded as falling below the standards that an environmental health officer would require.""

"Travellers from South America are no longer allowed to come into the UK, amid fears over a new coronavirus variant first identified in Brazil. The UK's new travel ban - which also applies to Portugal and Cape Verde - came into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday. Like variants discovered in the UK and South Africa, it is thought the Brazil variant could be more contagious. Virologist Prof Wendy Barclay said one Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. However, she said this was not ""the variant of concern"", which is thought to be more infectious. Prof Barclay, head of G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, which is studying the effects of emerging coronavirus mutations, said: ""There are two different types of Brazilian variants and one of them has been detected and one of them has not."" She added: ""The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK. ""Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found."" Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Brazilian variant of concern was not ""as far as we are aware"" already in the UK, adding that he did not believe there had been any flights from Brazil in the last week. It comes as a further 1,248 people with coronavirus have died in the UK. Latestgovernment figures on Thursday also showed,externalanother 48,682 new cases had been reported. Meanwhile, the number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine is now approaching three million. How worrying are the new Covid variants? Which countries are included in the UK travel ban? Coronavirus variants: The science explained The UK'snew travel ban,externalapplies to people who have travelled from, or through, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days. It also applies to Portugal - because of its strong links to Brazil - and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa, as well as Panama in central America. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights are still allowed to return - but must isolate for 10 days. Also exempt are hauliers who are travelling from Portugal to transport essential goods. Brazil has seen more than 200,000 deaths andthere is concern about the impactthe new mutation could have on its health system. However, the UK's travel ban was prompted by fears of how quickly the new variant could spread through the region - since Brazil borders 10 countries. Mr Shapps has said the ban is ""precautionary"", adding he ""can't provide an end date"" to the new rules. ""We're so close now, we've got three million of these vaccines in people's arms in the UK,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We want to make sure we don't fall at this last hurdle."" This video can not be played Grant Shapps explained the ban to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Because holidays are not currently allowed, Mr Shapps said he did not ""expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America"", and the government was ""not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result"". One family, who live in Wolverhampton, told the BBC they feared being stuck out in Brazil. ""I don't know if the government will organise flights,"" said Jon Dent, 31. He and his wife Carla travelled to the Brazilian city of Goiania in October to introduce their baby daughter to Carla's family. ""I think it's a long shot,"" he said. ""I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" Jon, pictured here with wife Carla and daughter Luiza, said his initial reaction to the news was worry Many countries imposed travel restrictions after new variants of Covid-19 were identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa. Several Central and South American nations - including Brazil - had already restricted travel from the UK before the latest ban on arrivals. There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of the variants cause more serious illness, and scientists are confident that vaccines should work against them. According to Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the new variant's origin was ""undoubtedly"" from the Amazon region. He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant showed some of the same mutations as the UK and South Africa variants - and ""some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Mr Shapps also announced Qatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were being removed from the UK's travel corridor list, meaning arrivals from those places will need to self-isolate for 10 days from 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Meanwhile,France has cracked down,externalon the type of tests that travellers can take to show they are negative. From Monday, travellers will need to show a negative PCR test. Antigen tests - which are the rapid lateral flow tests - will no longer be accepted. However, Mr Shapps said arrangements allowing hauliers to use rapid lateral flow tests before crossing the border from the UK into France remained in place at the moment. From Monday, everyone travelling to England and Scotland will also have to show proof of a negative test. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days.

"Craig Ross had been quoted making comments about food bank users on a podcast The Scottish Conservatives have dropped a Holyrood candidate over what they called ""unacceptable comments"". Craig Ross recorded a podcast last year in which he described food bank users as being more at risk of diabetes than starvation. He also questioned the influence footballer Marcus Rashford has on UK government welfare policy. The Conservatives suspended Mr Ross, then later announced he was ""no longer a candidate or a member of the party"". The party had launched an investigation after the comments came to light, saying: ""These unacceptable comments do not reflect the views of the party."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf had called for Mr Ross to be thrown out the party and dropped as the Conservative candidate in Glasgow Pollok. Rashford and top chefs demand free school meals review The Holyrood elections are due to be held on 6 May. Mr Ross, a former lecturer at Langside College, runs a podcast in which he delivers reaction to pieces in The Guardian newspaper ""from the centre-right"". In one episode recorded in June 2020, Mr Ross talked about the percentage of body fat of ""ordinary people"". Originally reported in theDaily Record,external, his comments were in response to a Channel 4 News piece featuring foodbanks. He said: ""We have no real grasp of just how ridiculously overweight the population is. ""I'm not saying that every single person who claims to be really hungry and is reliant on charity is also very overweight. ""But what I am saying is if Channel 4 News is having a reasonable go at showing the reality of food bank usage, then we know the people that they filmed are far from starving. If anything their biggest risk is not starvation, it's diabetes."" On Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, who hascalled on Boris Johnson to review the UK government's free school meals policy, Mr Ross said: ""Has Marcus Rashford stood for election to anything? Not that I'm aware of."" Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, has supported Mr Rashford's campaign.

"Quinn and Kai got off to a good start after technical issues across the UK with Microsoft The new school term began in Scotland this week - but many pupils and teachers did not return to the classroom. Instead, laptops, tablets and exercise books were opened on kitchen tables across the country as home-schooling began again in earnest. Day one was marred bytechnical difficulties as thousands of users logged on to Microsoft Teamsafter holidays. But did it get any better?  We asked some parents about their experience of home-schooling during the latest coronavirus lockdown. During the first lockdown Donna Bruce, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, juggled a full-time job and working from home while looking after her two children, Kai, 10, and eight-year-old Quinn. She didn't have enough devices for all three of them, and she had to occupy the children for seven hours a day while working at the same time. Her early Zoom meetings enjoyed guest appearances from half-naked children climbing kitchen cupboards to find snacks. This time round, she feels schools and teachers were better prepared. ""Teachers had made videos talking to the children and reassuring them,"" she said. ""I feel there is less pressure this time on parents and children, but children still need supervised and their time still needs occupied to allow parents to work and that's when the issues come in."" Some children got video messages from their teachers ""On day one, they finished all their assigned school work by 11:00 and I was working until 16:30,"" she added. ""I feel anxious and worry as the novelty wears off and my work gets busier, how I will cope. ""At the end of every day I question if I have done enough and try to remind myself it's not a race or a competition - if we all survive to tell this story in the future's history lesson then that's all that matters."" Kirsteen Roberts, from East Lothian, found the first lockdown stressful. Her son Finn is in S2, while daughters Layla and Summer are in P7 and P3 respectively. The primary school work was structured with teacher contact but the secondary work was ""patchy"". She said the younger two were pretty motivated but the eldest was frustrated and didn't have enough to do. ""With school, plus keeping on top of Zooms for extra curricular activities, I felt a huge pressure,"" she said. During the first lockdown, good weather meant children could get outside more Kirsteen was disappointed to return to online learning. ""None of us were looking forward to it and I feared that no work would be posted on the first day,"" she said. ""Thankfully I was proved wrong. The secondary school teachers have organised weekly class Google Meets this time around which is a big improvement. ""Everything went well technically and the first day went pretty smoothly - only two out of three of them ended up in tears after putting pressure on themselves. ""I feel we can get through it intact - as long as it really only is a few weeks this time. ""I think workwise the kids will get enough of what they need from the school without me having to find more on the BBC or websites like Twinkl, but it's still hard on them and they miss the classroom contact."" Resources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown. BBC Bitesize Learning at Home Primary school programmes on iPlayer Secondary school programmes on iPlayer Learn at BBC Scotland collection Fiona Keiller, from Perth and Kinross, is a single parent to Ross who is in P6. She said there were ""good days and bad days"" during the first stint of home learning. She did not feel her son was getting enough to do and she was also working full-time from home. This time around she was told Ross would have two live sessions per week via Microsoft Teams. ""My son struggles to get on with the tasks without my assistance, so he insists on trying to rope me into helping him, which is difficult when I am in meetings and trying to do my own work,"" Fiona said. ""I felt worse after the first day, I had forgotten just how stressful it is. Hopefully we will find our groove by week two, but I worry whether Teams is going to cope with the amount of traffic on it."" Emily Black is a keyworker from Aberdeenshire, with a daughter in S1 and a son in P1. The first time schools were closed, her daughter tried to complete tasks while her little brother tried to play with her. ""My son's behaviour became concerning and my daughter cried every day,"" she said. This time round, their rural internet has proved a problem. ""My daughter was up and at her laptop at 08:45. She is used to using Teams for homework but when it decided to play up, I thought she was going to launch her laptop out of the window,"" she said. ""My son really appreciated the welcome video message from his teacher so was a lot more engaged after his teacher had told him to do his jobs and then he could have fun. ""It went a lot better than I expected. But it has also exposed that I'm not a teacher and I would struggle to keep this up longer-term, trying to help both of them - at some times simultaneously. But I don't know if it will be the same in a couple of weeks."" Mark Cummings from East Dunbartonshire has two daughters, one in P2 and one in kindergarten. Both attend an independent fee-paying school. He was disappointed by the timing of this government's decision - just after the festive break - but he said his daughter's school has been ""excellent"". ""They are well organised and clear in what they are trying to do,"" he said. ""Our daughters are getting a full curriculum each day (two live lessons with teacher and classmates and four pre-recorded topic lessons). It is not comparable to the experience they get at school but is a great effort nonetheless."" But he is concerned about the long-term effects of home-learning. ""Online learning is not adequate and will lead to greater disparity in learning between different types of pupils who attend different types of schools,"" he said.

"Travellers from South America are no longer allowed to come into the UK, amid fears over a new coronavirus variant first identified in Brazil. The UK's new travel ban - which also applies to Portugal and Cape Verde - came into force at 04:00 GMT on Friday. Like variants discovered in the UK and South Africa, it is thought the Brazil variant could be more contagious. Virologist Prof Wendy Barclay said one Brazilian variant had already been detected in the UK. However, she said this was not ""the variant of concern"", which is thought to be more infectious. Prof Barclay, head of G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, which is studying the effects of emerging coronavirus mutations, said: ""There are two different types of Brazilian variants and one of them has been detected and one of them has not."" She added: ""The new Brazilian variant of concern, that was picked up in travellers going to Japan, has not been detected in the UK. ""Other variants that may have originated from Brazil have been previously found."" Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Brazilian variant of concern was not ""as far as we are aware"" already in the UK, adding that he did not believe there had been any flights from Brazil in the last week. It comes as a further 1,248 people with coronavirus have died in the UK. Latestgovernment figures on Thursday also showed,externalanother 48,682 new cases had been reported. Meanwhile, the number of people in the UK to have received the first dose of a vaccine is now approaching three million. How worrying are the new Covid variants? Which countries are included in the UK travel ban? Coronavirus variants: The science explained The UK'snew travel ban,externalapplies to people who have travelled from, or through, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela in the last 10 days. It also applies to Portugal - because of its strong links to Brazil - and the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde off the coast of west Africa, as well as Panama in central America. British and Irish citizens and foreign nationals with residence rights are still allowed to return - but must isolate for 10 days. Also exempt are hauliers who are travelling from Portugal to transport essential goods. Brazil has seen more than 200,000 deaths andthere is concern about the impactthe new mutation could have on its health system. However, the UK's travel ban was prompted by fears of how quickly the new variant could spread through the region - since Brazil borders 10 countries. Mr Shapps has said the ban is ""precautionary"", adding he ""can't provide an end date"" to the new rules. ""We're so close now, we've got three million of these vaccines in people's arms in the UK,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We want to make sure we don't fall at this last hurdle."" This video can not be played Grant Shapps explained the ban to BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Because holidays are not currently allowed, Mr Shapps said he did not ""expect a large number of Brits to have jaunted off to South America"", and the government was ""not expecting to see a big repatriation issue as a result"". One family, who live in Wolverhampton, told the BBC they feared being stuck out in Brazil. ""I don't know if the government will organise flights,"" said Jon Dent, 31. He and his wife Carla travelled to the Brazilian city of Goiania in October to introduce their baby daughter to Carla's family. ""I think it's a long shot,"" he said. ""I hope we can get home and not be stranded out here for months. We've got to be patient but at the same time flexible."" Jon, pictured here with wife Carla and daughter Luiza, said his initial reaction to the news was worry Many countries imposed travel restrictions after new variants of Covid-19 were identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa. Several Central and South American nations - including Brazil - had already restricted travel from the UK before the latest ban on arrivals. There is currently no evidence to suggest that any of the variants cause more serious illness, and scientists are confident that vaccines should work against them. According to Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the Brazilian state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the new variant's origin was ""undoubtedly"" from the Amazon region. He told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson the new variant showed some of the same mutations as the UK and South Africa variants - and ""some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Mr Shapps also announced Qatar and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were being removed from the UK's travel corridor list, meaning arrivals from those places will need to self-isolate for 10 days from 04:00 GMT on Saturday. Meanwhile,France has cracked down,externalon the type of tests that travellers can take to show they are negative. From Monday, travellers will need to show a negative PCR test. Antigen tests - which are the rapid lateral flow tests - will no longer be accepted. However, Mr Shapps said arrangements allowing hauliers to use rapid lateral flow tests before crossing the border from the UK into France remained in place at the moment. From Monday, everyone travelling to England and Scotland will also have to show proof of a negative test. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce their own plans in the coming days.

"This video can not be played Biden: 'I promise we will not forget you' President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus plan for the coronavirus-sapped US economy before he takes office next week. If passed by Congress, it would include $1tn for households, with direct payments of $1,400 to all Americans. The relief proposal includes $415bn to fight the virus and $440bn for small businesses. Mr Biden, a Democrat, has promised to beat the pandemic that has killed more than 385,000 people in the US. He campaigned last year vowing to do a better job handling the virus than outgoing President Donald Trump, a Republican. The direct payments of $1,400 would come on top of $600 payments provided in a relief bill enacted last month. Mr Biden's proposal comes as a winter surge of the coronavirus breaks records. Each day brings well over 200,000 new cases in the US and the daily death toll sometimes tops 4,000. US faces bleak winter amid worst Covid wave yet How much can Joe Biden get done on the US economy? In a primetime speech on Thursday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, he said: ""A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there's no time to waste."" ""The very health of our nation is at stake,"" he added. ""We have to act and we have to act now."" The incoming president said: ""There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet."" Mr Biden wants to pump $20bn into vaccinating Americans, including setting up mass vaccination hubs and dispatching mobile units to remote areas. Two effective vaccines were delivered under the Trump administration, but health officials say the rollout needs to speed up. ""The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,"" said Mr Biden. His administration aims to deliver 100 million jabs in 100 days. So far,about 11 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US,external, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His plan also calls for $50bn to expand testing and $130bn to help most schools reopen by the spring. The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers for contact tracing. By BBC Reality Check US officials have acknowledged that the vaccination programme has not been working as smoothly as planned,external, and a goal to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020 was not met. ""We know that it should be better, and we're working hard to make it better,"" said Moncef Slaoui, who leads the government's vaccine rollout plan, at the end of December. President Trump has deflected attention onto the states to deliver the jabs - telling them to ""get moving"" - but there has also been criticism of the level of government support given to local health authorities. And there have been issues around getting sufficient supplies to vaccinations centres, as well as co-ordination and preparedness at the state level. There are wide variations in vaccination rates: South Dakota has administered more than 6,000 doses per 100,000 people, and Alabama fewer than 2,000. When you look at vaccine doses per head in the countries doing the most vaccinations, the US is currently fourth. With nearly 11 million people unemployed across the country, supplemental jobless benefits would increase to $400 a week from $300 a week now. They would also be extended until September, along with a moratorium on evictions and home repossessions. The proposal would bring payouts for families to the $2,000 figure that both Mr Biden and Mr Trump called for. Lady Gaga to sing at Joe Biden's inauguration What Joe Biden wants to do The president-elect will also call on Congress to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour - a Democratic priority that predates the pandemic. Republicans are likely to object to piling up trillions more in debt that the US has already incurred to tackle the pandemic, and the incoming president acknowledged his plan ""does not come cheaply"". But he will be helped by his fellow Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress, if only by narrow margins. Trump faces Senate trial after historic charge The beginning of Mr Biden's term, however, will take place against the backdrop of a US Senate impeachment trial for his predecessor. It is unclear how quickly the Senate will proceed - or whether it will vote to convict President Trump - but the drama is expected to prove a distraction from the Biden agenda.

"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as England was placed in lockdown for a second time, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said,externalit meant gross domestic product was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak. November's decline came after six consecutive months of growth. Pubs and hairdressers were badly hit as the service sector suffered, the ONS said, but some manufacturing and construction activity improved. The hit to the service sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy - meant it contracted by 3.4% in November, and is now 9.9% below the level of February 2020. Some economists said the November figure was better than expected, and it appeared many companies were better prepared for the second lockdown, with some sectors staying open for business and many firms having already put in place plans to expand online operations. ""Steps taken by businesses earlier in the year to Covid-proof their operations - combined with the time-limited nature of the restrictions, and schools remaining open - meant more companies were able to continue trading safely,"" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI employers' group. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed ""it's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face"". But he said the vaccine roll-out and economic support measures meant there were reasons to be hopeful. ""With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the figures showed the UK has an economic ""mountain to climb"". Speaking to the BBC, she said it would be a ""serious mistake"" if Mr Sunak waited until the Budget in March before providing more support and confidence for business. ONS director for economic statistics Darren Morgan said: ""The economy took a hit from restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic during November, with pubs and hairdressers seeing the biggest impact."" However, he said many firms adjusted to the new pandemic working conditions, such as by expanding click and collect and other online operations. He added: ""Manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, while schools also stayed open, meaning the impact on the economy was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown. ""Car manufacturing, bolstered by demand from abroad, housebuilding and infrastructure grew and are now all above their pre-pandemic levels."" Construction activity grew by 1.9% during the month. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Despite the GDP figure being better than some analysts had forecast, there are still concerns that the UK could be heading back into recession. Economists have warned the UK could see a double-dip recession if restrictions remain in place in the first three months of 2021. Rory Macqueen, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the November figures confirm a significant slowdown in the last quarter of 2020, ""despite November's lockdown in England clearly having a far smaller effect than the first"". James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said there would be a lot of comment about whether these figures point to the UK heading for only its second-ever double-dip recession on record. But, he said, the real ""story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure"". ""The chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease,"" he added. Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' Analysts at Capital Economics also said there was cause for optimism, saying that the current third lockdown could have less impact than feared. ""The economy has built up a fair bit of immunity to lockdowns, as November's lockdown was much less painful for the economy than the first lockdown. ""As a result, the Covid-19 economic hole is smaller than we thought, the economy may get back to its pre-crisis crisis level a bit sooner and it makes us more confident that the Bank of England probably won't resort to negative interest rates."" The fall in the economy in November was still considerable, but the figures show businesses adapting to difficult conditions. The hit was a fraction of what occurred in the first lockdown last April, and was mainly confined to the service sector, with pubs and hairdressing for example in sharp decline. Manufacturing and construction largely remained open, as did previously shut public services such as schools. By November car manufacturing and house building were back above the level of output before the pandemic. The trade figures also showed a Â£7bn increase in EU imports in the three months to November as traders stockpiled car parts, medicines and other goods ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period. The renewed regional tiered restrictions in December, and more severe national lockdowns this month, still indicate a possible return to overall recession in this tough winter. Business groups continue to argue that extra support is required to support jobs and cash flow well before the Budget in March. But a more sustained lifting of restrictions as vaccines are rolled out should see growth return after the spring. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"UK to close all travel corridors from 04:00 GMT on Monday, PM Boris Johnson said at Downing Street press conference Travellers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test in previous 72 hours - with new rules in place until at least 15 February More than 2 million people have now died of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University UK government scientists put the coronavirus R number - the average rate of spread - in the UK at 1.2 to 1.3, similar to last week A ban on travellers from South America and Portugal came into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil The health system in the Brazilian city of Manaus is said to be collapsing amid soaring infections linked to the new variant Edited by Sarah Collerton We are going to be closing the live page soon so here's a recap of today's coronavirus headlines:  That's all from the live team but we will be back tomorrow. These updates were brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Sarah Collerton, Vanessa Barford, Emma Harrison, George Wright, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Bisset and Joshua Cheetham. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that the city may run out of coronavirus vaccines next week without a resupply. âIf we donât get a serious supply, weâre going to have to freeze the appointment system,"" he told WNYC radio. ""That would be insane, after all the progress weâve made.â He's the latest official to express concern for vaccine supplies, in a state that was once at the epicentre of America's outbreak and continues to be one of the worst-affected parts of the US. New York State receives about 300,000 doses a week, and a third of these go to New York City, according to officials. But Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that the state would be receiving 50,000 fewer doses next week. While New York City has historically been struggling to administer jabs at scale, the pace picked up this week due to the expansion of vaccination sites, and more people becoming eligible. Between Monday and Thursday, the city administered nearly 120,000 doses. A temporary mortuary that can hold up to 1,300 bodies has been opened in Ruislip, west London, as the capital faces a growing coronavirus death toll. London recently exceeded 10,000 Covid-related deaths, a figure Mayor Sadiq Khan described as ""heartbreaking"". The Breakspear Crematorium facility, which took a week to build and cost about Â£3m, isexpected to receive bodies from Friday. It has been called ""a visual, sobering reminder"" of the continuing cost of the pandemic. Westminster City Council chief executive Stuart Love, who is leading the London-wide response, says: ""We have built this really hoping it doesn't get used to its capacity. ""This just re-emphasises the message of staying at home and looking after your loved ones."" Portugal has entered its second national lockdown, with all non-essential businesses closed. Unlike in the previous lockdown, however, schools will remain open. Measures will also be relaxed for the presidential election, which takes place on 24 January. The new restrictions came into force as Portugal's daily deaths reached 159 on Friday. Infections, meanwhile, were at the second-highest number since the pandemic began, with 10,663 new cases announced the same day. Portugal has recorded more than half a million cases and 8,543 deaths from Covid-19, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Norwegian Air has axed its long haul network due to the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry Airline bosses have said they support the government's decision to close all travel corridors to the UK to prevent the import of new variants of coronavirus. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of
Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers,
said: âTravel
corridors were a lifeline for the industry last summer and the government were
right to bring them in when they did. ""But things change and thereâs no doubting
this is a serious health emergency and ministers need to act to keep borders
safe and the public protected. ""We therefore support this latest measure, on the
assumption that we will work with government â when the time is right â to
remove these restrictions when it is safe to do so and start to open up our
sector again, to support the UKâs economic recovery.â Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all travel corridors with the UK will be closed from 04:00 GMT on Monday. This means all arrivals to the UK must self-isolate or quarantine for up to 10 days upon arrival to the country (most passengers will also need proof of a negative Covid test too). When it comes to enforcement of the quarantine rules, the latest figures we have show police in England and Wales investigated around 9,000 cases â of reported breaches - in the period to 24 November 2020. The majority â just over 7,000 - needed no further investigation. In almost 1,400 cases, the police were unable to take any action because no-one answered the door or they had the wrong address. Just 223 fines were actually given out. Border Force are also able to hand out fines but we canât find any figures for this. A survey from the Office for National Statistics in October showed that roughly two-thirds of people in England said they were following the quarantine rules. This means the other third said they had breached the rules in some way or another. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government announcement to suspend all UK travel corridors
is the âright stepâ but called the timing of the decision âslow againâ. He says the public will be thinking âwhy on earth didnât this happen
before?"" He also ""urgently"" called for a âlonger term plan for the
airline industryâ going forward and said that the enforcement of isolation upon
arrival needs to be properly addressed, as âthe quarantine hasnât really been
policed effectively at all.â Asked if he forced former Scottish Labour Leader Richard
Leonardâs hand in resigning, Mr Starmer said he wanted to âpay tribute to
Richard and everything he achievedâ and insisted the decision was his alone. The prime minister finished a Downing Street press
conference a short time ago. He was speaking alongside England's chief medical officer
Prof Chris Whitty and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the main takeaways: Asked about reports of deliveries of vaccines being cancelled, the prime minister says the crucial thing is that everyone gets down to their vaccination centre when they get the message to come for their vaccine. ""When we have the problem of some groups or some people not getting the message or perhaps being a bit reluctant to go for one reason or another that we all work to make it clear this is a great thing to do,"" the PM says. He says local councils and public health directors will know where to find people who are hard to reach. ""We have got the Army, we've got pharmacies and we have got the NHS,"" he adds. That marks the end of the press conference. We will bring you a round-up of it shortly. More than two million people have now died with Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has recorded more fatalities than any other country, with almost 390,000 deaths, followed by Brazil and India with around 200,000 and 150,000 deaths respectively. More than 93 million infections have been recorded worldwide. The prime minister says there is ""clearly"" a problem with care home infections and the government is working ""flat-out"" to vaccinate residents and staff. About 40% of elderly residents have received jabs and the hope is that the programme will be complete by the end of January, he adds. In some areas, 80% to 90% of 80-year-olds have received vaccination offers, Boris Johnson says. Sir Patrick Vallance calls it a ""miracle"" that so many vaccines have been developed so quickly. It's too soon to see the effect on transmission yet, but it would be ""very surprising"" if they didn't have a ""decent effect"" in curbing the spread, he says. Sebastian Payne, of the Financial Times, asks what will happen to the rest of society once the most vulnerable are inoculated. Boris Johnson says it is the question which preoccupies most of us at the moment. ""Let's focus for now on getting those cohorts, the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] groups one-to-four - the over-70s, the over-80s - vaccinated and I think that will already make a huge difference,"" he says. He adds there is a ""debate to be had"" on what happens after that, ""and we will make sure everybody has a chance to have their say"". Asked again about vaccine wastage, Prof Chris Whitty says there have been ""perfectly sensible decisions made by GPs"" to maximise the delivery of vaccines, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine which needs to be stored at -70C. He says the overwhelming volume of vaccines have gone to the over-80s. Speaking earlier at the Downing Street press conference, the prime minister announced the UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Watch here: This video can not be played PM announces that the UK's travel corridors will close The threat of unidentified Covid strains from abroad means tougher action is needed, the PM says. Asked about figures on supply of vaccines and some reports of wastage, Boris Johnson says the key question is ""getting jabs into arms"". Batches have to be tested for safety, he adds, saying that the government is ""using all the supply that we can possibly lay our hands on"". Prof Chris Whitty says he has never said things will get better by Easter, adding the PM may have quoted him as saying that. But he says an improvement is likely at some point during spring. Increasingly, he predicts, the vaccine will do ""more of the heavy lifting"" in dealing with the pandemic. The situation will get ""a lot better than it is now"" in the next few months, Whitty says. Sir Patrick Vallance says a lot of work is going on to ""optimise"" workplace hygiene to prevent infections. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent There have long been calls
for the rules for people arriving into the UK to be tightened up to stop Covid cases being imported. The government only this
month introduced the requirement for proof of a negative Covid test on entry
and other countries have had stricter policies in place for months. With two prominent variants
of the virus - originating in Brazil and South Africa - already on the
governmentâs radar, ministers seem determined to get ahead of any others that
may yet pose a risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks if the move to put restrictions in at the borders is too late. The PM says the government is taking steps to protect against the new variants. ""We have a situation now where we have a very high rate of domestic infection in the UK combined with a vaccination programme,"" he says. ""There will come a point in the next weeks and months where the vaccination programme will take effect... and you will see a decline in the death rate. ""What you can't have is a situation where you have new variants with unknown qualities coming in from abroad and that's why we have set up the system to stop arrivals where new variants are a concern."" Sir Patrick Vallance says the virus is changing all the time and he suspects there are variants ""all over the world of different types"". ""The countries which have detected them first have got good sequencing,"" he says. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says some hospitals in London and south-eastern England are so busy they're having to move patients hundreds of miles and asks how the NHS is set to cope over the next few weeks. The PM says the NHS in London has been coping ""magnificently"" and intensive care units are not yet overwhelmed. There are ""tentative early signs that the pressure might be easing slightly"" in the capital but it's too early to be confident of that. Prof Chris Whitty says the hope is that infections have already peaked in some areas of the country, but the peak of hospitalisations is delayed until about a week after infections, with the peak of deaths later still. The peak of deaths is, he says, likely to be in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says the measures in place must remain in place to suppress the figures. Michael from Cornwall asks at what rate of deaths and infections the government will lift lockdown restrictions. The prime minister says the government wants to get to a stage where the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. ""Depending on the effectiveness of that roll-out, and we are hoping to do all of them by the 15 February, we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions, but it will also depend on where the disease is and what's happening,"" he says. ""We can't have any false sense of security so that we lift the restrictions all together and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations,"" Mr Johnson adds. Prof Whitty says we will not ""move from a sudden lockdown situation to nothing"". Asked about plans for any future variant that may be more easily transmissable, the PM says a lot of scientific work is being done on keeping vaccines updated. He adds that the ""tough"" measures at borders and airports will also help this effort. Sir Patrick Vallance says there's a ""very comprehensive"" method used to keep up with developments. The new UK variant transmits more readily but there's nothing to suggest it's more intense. Other variants may get round vaccines in the future, he adds, but scientists ""don't know that"". Vaccines are ""really quite easy to adjust"", thanks to recent developments, Sir Patrick adds. It's also likely that vaccines used now will protect against new variants, he says. Prof Chris Whitty stresses the need for international co-operation on vaccines to keep ahead of variants that develop. Prof Whitty says deaths will continue to rise into next week because of the lag between people going into hospital and then some dying. But he says the effects of everyone's actions will begin to reduce ""this strong pressure"" on the NHS, along with the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Â© 2025 BBC.

The majority â just over 7,000 - needed no further investigation. In almost 1,400 cases, the police were unable to take any action because no-one answered the door or they had the wrong address. Just 223 fines were actually given out. Border Force are also able to hand out fines but we canât find any figures for this. A survey from the Office for National Statistics in October showed that roughly two-thirds of people in England said they were following the quarantine rules. This means the other third said they had breached the rules in some way or another. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government announcement to suspend all UK travel corridors
is the âright stepâ but called the timing of the decision âslow againâ. He says the public will be thinking âwhy on earth didnât this happen
before?"" He also ""urgently"" called for a âlonger term plan for the
airline industryâ going forward and said that the enforcement of isolation upon
arrival needs to be properly addressed, as âthe quarantine hasnât really been
policed effectively at all.â Asked if he forced former Scottish Labour Leader Richard
Leonardâs hand in resigning, Mr Starmer said he wanted to âpay tribute to
Richard and everything he achievedâ and insisted the decision was his alone. The prime minister finished a Downing Street press
conference a short time ago. He was speaking alongside England's chief medical officer
Prof Chris Whitty and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the main takeaways: Asked about reports of deliveries of vaccines being cancelled, the prime minister says the crucial thing is that everyone gets down to their vaccination centre when they get the message to come for their vaccine. ""When we have the problem of some groups or some people not getting the message or perhaps being a bit reluctant to go for one reason or another that we all work to make it clear this is a great thing to do,"" the PM says. He says local councils and public health directors will know where to find people who are hard to reach. ""We have got the Army, we've got pharmacies and we have got the NHS,"" he adds. That marks the end of the press conference. We will bring you a round-up of it shortly. More than two million people have now died with Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has recorded more fatalities than any other country, with almost 390,000 deaths, followed by Brazil and India with around 200,000 and 150,000 deaths respectively. More than 93 million infections have been recorded worldwide. The prime minister says there is ""clearly"" a problem with care home infections and the government is working ""flat-out"" to vaccinate residents and staff. About 40% of elderly residents have received jabs and the hope is that the programme will be complete by the end of January, he adds. In some areas, 80% to 90% of 80-year-olds have received vaccination offers, Boris Johnson says. Sir Patrick Vallance calls it a ""miracle"" that so many vaccines have been developed so quickly. It's too soon to see the effect on transmission yet, but it would be ""very surprising"" if they didn't have a ""decent effect"" in curbing the spread, he says. Sebastian Payne, of the Financial Times, asks what will happen to the rest of society once the most vulnerable are inoculated. Boris Johnson says it is the question which preoccupies most of us at the moment. ""Let's focus for now on getting those cohorts, the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] groups one-to-four - the over-70s, the over-80s - vaccinated and I think that will already make a huge difference,"" he says. He adds there is a ""debate to be had"" on what happens after that, ""and we will make sure everybody has a chance to have their say"". Asked again about vaccine wastage, Prof Chris Whitty says there have been ""perfectly sensible decisions made by GPs"" to maximise the delivery of vaccines, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine which needs to be stored at -70C. He says the overwhelming volume of vaccines have gone to the over-80s. Speaking earlier at the Downing Street press conference, the prime minister announced the UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Watch here: This video can not be played PM announces that the UK's travel corridors will close The threat of unidentified Covid strains from abroad means tougher action is needed, the PM says. Asked about figures on supply of vaccines and some reports of wastage, Boris Johnson says the key question is ""getting jabs into arms"". Batches have to be tested for safety, he adds, saying that the government is ""using all the supply that we can possibly lay our hands on"". Prof Chris Whitty says he has never said things will get better by Easter, adding the PM may have quoted him as saying that. But he says an improvement is likely at some point during spring. Increasingly, he predicts, the vaccine will do ""more of the heavy lifting"" in dealing with the pandemic. The situation will get ""a lot better than it is now"" in the next few months, Whitty says. Sir Patrick Vallance says a lot of work is going on to ""optimise"" workplace hygiene to prevent infections. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent There have long been calls
for the rules for people arriving into the UK to be tightened up to stop Covid cases being imported. The government only this
month introduced the requirement for proof of a negative Covid test on entry
and other countries have had stricter policies in place for months. With two prominent variants
of the virus - originating in Brazil and South Africa - already on the
governmentâs radar, ministers seem determined to get ahead of any others that
may yet pose a risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks if the move to put restrictions in at the borders is too late. The PM says the government is taking steps to protect against the new variants. ""We have a situation now where we have a very high rate of domestic infection in the UK combined with a vaccination programme,"" he says. ""There will come a point in the next weeks and months where the vaccination programme will take effect... and you will see a decline in the death rate. ""What you can't have is a situation where you have new variants with unknown qualities coming in from abroad and that's why we have set up the system to stop arrivals where new variants are a concern."" Sir Patrick Vallance says the virus is changing all the time and he suspects there are variants ""all over the world of different types"". ""The countries which have detected them first have got good sequencing,"" he says. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says some hospitals in London and south-eastern England are so busy they're having to move patients hundreds of miles and asks how the NHS is set to cope over the next few weeks. The PM says the NHS in London has been coping ""magnificently"" and intensive care units are not yet overwhelmed. There are ""tentative early signs that the pressure might be easing slightly"" in the capital but it's too early to be confident of that. Prof Chris Whitty says the hope is that infections have already peaked in some areas of the country, but the peak of hospitalisations is delayed until about a week after infections, with the peak of deaths later still. The peak of deaths is, he says, likely to be in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says the measures in place must remain in place to suppress the figures. Michael from Cornwall asks at what rate of deaths and infections the government will lift lockdown restrictions. The prime minister says the government wants to get to a stage where the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. ""Depending on the effectiveness of that roll-out, and we are hoping to do all of them by the 15 February, we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions, but it will also depend on where the disease is and what's happening,"" he says. ""We can't have any false sense of security so that we lift the restrictions all together and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations,"" Mr Johnson adds. Prof Whitty says we will not ""move from a sudden lockdown situation to nothing"". Asked about plans for any future variant that may be more easily transmissable, the PM says a lot of scientific work is being done on keeping vaccines updated. He adds that the ""tough"" measures at borders and airports will also help this effort. Sir Patrick Vallance says there's a ""very comprehensive"" method used to keep up with developments. The new UK variant transmits more readily but there's nothing to suggest it's more intense. Other variants may get round vaccines in the future, he adds, but scientists ""don't know that"". Vaccines are ""really quite easy to adjust"", thanks to recent developments, Sir Patrick adds. It's also likely that vaccines used now will protect against new variants, he says. Prof Chris Whitty stresses the need for international co-operation on vaccines to keep ahead of variants that develop. Prof Whitty says deaths will continue to rise into next week because of the lag between people going into hospital and then some dying. But he says the effects of everyone's actions will begin to reduce ""this strong pressure"" on the NHS, along with the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Biden: 'I promise we will not forget you' President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus plan for the coronavirus-sapped US economy before he takes office next week. If passed by Congress, it would include $1tn for households, with direct payments of $1,400 to all Americans. The relief proposal includes $415bn to fight the virus and $440bn for small businesses. Mr Biden, a Democrat, has promised to beat the pandemic that has killed more than 385,000 people in the US. He campaigned last year vowing to do a better job handling the virus than outgoing President Donald Trump, a Republican. The direct payments of $1,400 would come on top of $600 payments provided in a relief bill enacted last month. Mr Biden's proposal comes as a winter surge of the coronavirus breaks records. Each day brings well over 200,000 new cases in the US and the daily death toll sometimes tops 4,000. US faces bleak winter amid worst Covid wave yet How much can Joe Biden get done on the US economy? In a primetime speech on Thursday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, he said: ""A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there's no time to waste."" ""The very health of our nation is at stake,"" he added. ""We have to act and we have to act now."" The incoming president said: ""There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet."" Mr Biden wants to pump $20bn into vaccinating Americans, including setting up mass vaccination hubs and dispatching mobile units to remote areas. Two effective vaccines were delivered under the Trump administration, but health officials say the rollout needs to speed up. ""The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,"" said Mr Biden. His administration aims to deliver 100 million jabs in 100 days. So far,about 11 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US,external, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His plan also calls for $50bn to expand testing and $130bn to help most schools reopen by the spring. The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers for contact tracing. By BBC Reality Check US officials have acknowledged that the vaccination programme has not been working as smoothly as planned,external, and a goal to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020 was not met. ""We know that it should be better, and we're working hard to make it better,"" said Moncef Slaoui, who leads the government's vaccine rollout plan, at the end of December. President Trump has deflected attention onto the states to deliver the jabs - telling them to ""get moving"" - but there has also been criticism of the level of government support given to local health authorities. And there have been issues around getting sufficient supplies to vaccinations centres, as well as co-ordination and preparedness at the state level. There are wide variations in vaccination rates: South Dakota has administered more than 6,000 doses per 100,000 people, and Alabama fewer than 2,000. When you look at vaccine doses per head in the countries doing the most vaccinations, the US is currently fourth. With nearly 11 million people unemployed across the country, supplemental jobless benefits would increase to $400 a week from $300 a week now. They would also be extended until September, along with a moratorium on evictions and home repossessions. The proposal would bring payouts for families to the $2,000 figure that both Mr Biden and Mr Trump called for. Lady Gaga to sing at Joe Biden's inauguration What Joe Biden wants to do The president-elect will also call on Congress to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour - a Democratic priority that predates the pandemic. Republicans are likely to object to piling up trillions more in debt that the US has already incurred to tackle the pandemic, and the incoming president acknowledged his plan ""does not come cheaply"". But he will be helped by his fellow Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress, if only by narrow margins. Trump faces Senate trial after historic charge The beginning of Mr Biden's term, however, will take place against the backdrop of a US Senate impeachment trial for his predecessor. It is unclear how quickly the Senate will proceed - or whether it will vote to convict President Trump - but the drama is expected to prove a distraction from the Biden agenda.

"This video can not be played At Fullwell Cross Medical Centre, north London, they are now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Fake news is likely to be causing some people from the UK's South Asian communities to reject the Covid vaccine, a doctor has warned. Dr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive, said it was ""a big concern"" and officials were working ""to correct so much fake news"". He said language and cultural barriers played a part in the false information. A GP in the West Midlands told the BBC some of her South Asian patients had refused the vaccine when offered it. Dr Sood, from NHS England, said officials were working with South Asian role models, influencers, community leaders and religious leaders to help debunk myths about the vaccine. Much of the disinformation surrounds the contents of the vaccine. He said: ""We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine, it has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities."" ""We're trying to find role models and influencers and also thinking about ordinary citizens who need to be quick with this information so that they can all support one another because ultimately everyone is a role model to everyone"", he added. ""There's a big piece of work happening where we're translating information, we're making sure the look and feel of it reaches the populations that matter."" WhatsApp rumours fear over BAME vaccine take up Clinics urge Asian community to take up vaccine The vaccines explained in five South Asian languages Some of the disinformation seen by the BBC on social media and on WhatsApp is religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims, as does eating beef for Hindus. Dr Samara Afzal has been vaccinating people in Dudley, West Midlands. She said: ""We've been calling all patients and booking them in for vaccines but the admin staff say when they call a lot of the South Asian patients they decline and refuse to have the vaccination. ""Also talking to friends and family have found the same. I've had friends calling me telling me to convince their parents or their grandparents to have the vaccination because other family members have convinced them not to have it"". Reena Pujara is a beauty therapist in Hampshire and a practising Hindu. She said she's been bombarded with false information. ""Some of the videos are quite disturbing especially when you actually see the person reporting is a medic and telling you that the vaccine is going to alter your DNA,"" she said. ""For a layman it is very confusing. And also when you read that the ingredients in the vaccine derive from a cow - and as Hindus the cow is sacred to us - it is disturbing."" About 100 mosques have a joined a campaign to counter vaccine disinformation and persuade their communities to take the vaccine. They've said they'll use their Friday sermons to urge people to have the jab. ""There should be no hesitation in taking [the vaccine] from a moral perspective,"" said Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB), which has organised the campaign. ""It is our ethical duty to protect ourselves and others from harm."" Why 'disappearing' vaccine needles aren't a scam No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Asian Network that faith and community leaders had a big role to play in ensuring a high take-up of the vaccine. He said he had met with more than 150 leaders from Sikh, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim communities who were taking the message out ""that it's the right thing to do"". He added that the government was taking steps to tackle online disinformation around the vaccine, as well as making sure vaccine guidance was available in many different languages. A recent poll, commissioned by the Royal Society of Public Health, suggested just over half of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people would be happy to have the coronavirus vaccine. It found 57% said they would take the vaccine - compared with 79% of white people.

"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has denied reports that his department is planning to dilute UK workers' rights. It comes after the Financial Times said some protections brought in under EU law - such as the 48-hour limit on the working week - could be scrapped. New rules on rest breaks and changes to how holiday pay is calculated from overtime could be proposed, it added. But Mr Kwarteng insisted he wanted to ""protect and enhance workers' rights going forward, not row back on them"".

Labour said the newspaper report suggested the government was out of step with public feeling on workplace rules. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""These proposals are not about cutting red tape for businesses but ripping up vital rights for workers. They should not even be up for discussion."" The FT said,externalthe proposals were being drawn up with the approval of Downing Street, but that they hadn't yet been approved by ministers or cabinet. A government spokesperson said: ""We have absolutely no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights. ""The UK has one of the best workers' rights records in the world, and it is well known that the UK goes further than the EU in many areas. ""Leaving the EU allows us to continue to be a standard setter and protect and enhance UK workers' rights."" When the UK left the EU it retained many of its laws, but it is now able to change them. One aspect of EU employment regulation is the EU's Working Time Directive. It governs the hours employees in the EU can be asked to work. This must not exceed 48 hours on average, including any overtime. But employees can choose to opt out of the 48-hour week,external, if they often work overtime in roles in the emergency services, for example. In the 2019 Queen's Speech outlining the government's agenda for the coming parliamentary session, changes in employment law were promised. A new Employment Bill is expected to be published in 2021. One issue it is thought  it will address is over the distribution of tips. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady urged the prime minister to ""make good on his promises to his voters"" on Friday.

"This video can not be played Rescuers pull a woman from the rubble after the 6.2 magnitude earthquake A powerful earthquake has rocked Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 42 people, with more feared dead as rescuers search for survivors. The 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday morning, just hours after an earlier, smaller tremor. Hundreds of people were injured and thousands displaced by the quake. Indonesia has a history of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, withmore than 2,000 killed in a 2018 Sulawesi quake. Eight people died when the five-storey Mitra Manakarra Hospital in Mamuju partially collapsed on Friday, officials said. About 60 people were safely evacuated from the hospital. ""It happened so quickly, around 10 seconds,"" Syamsu Ridwan, a local police spokesman, told the BBC. He said the power in the hospital cut out during the earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will increase as rescue efforts continue. Rescuers were still searching for survivors late on Friday, but they have been hampered by power cuts and poor mobile phone service. Indonesian President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims, urging people to stay calm and for the authorities to step up search efforts. Earthquake 'hack' reveals scale of ocean warming New equation âcould predict earthquakes betterâ The epicentre of Friday's quake was six kilometres (3.73 miles) northeast of Majene city at a depth of 10km. Video footage on social media showed collapsed houses and a girl pinned under rubble calling for help. The situation was ""pretty bad"", Dr Gayatri Marliyani, of the geology department at Gajah Mada University in Yogyakarta, told the BBC. She said the governor's office was among the collapsed buildings and confirmed that several hospitals and one hotel had also been damaged. She also warned that getting response teams to the area could be hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. Indonesia has a history of devastating quakes Tremors were felt at around 01:00 local time on Friday (17:00 Thursday GMT) for about seven seconds. No tsunami warning was issued but thousands are reported to have left their homes, fleeing to safety. Authorities have warned that strong aftershocks could follow the two main quakes and that they could still trigger a tsunami. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the so-called Ring of Fire - a line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions on the Pacific rim. In 2004, a tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatrakilled 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. The Indian Oceantsunami of 2004 killed 170,000 people on the Indonesian island of Sumatraafter a quake of magnitude 9.1. Are you in the area?

"Tens of thousands of small businesses will receive insurance payouts covering losses from the first national lockdown, following a court ruling. The Supreme Court found largely in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies. For some businesses it could provide a lifeline, allowing them to trade beyond the coronavirus crisis. The ruling could cost the insurance sector hundreds of millions of pounds. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), brought the test case, with eight insurers agreeing to take part in proceedings. One of the insurers set to make significant payouts is Hiscox, which was challenged by thousands of its policyholders as part of the case. Richard Leedham, who represented the Hiscox Action Group - on behalf of small businesses, said: ""This is a landmark victory for a small group of businesses who took on a huge insurance player and have been fully vindicated. ""What is important now is that Hiscox accepts the Supreme Court's verdict and starts paying out to its policy holders, many of whom are in danger of going under"". Other insurers involved in the test case are Arch, Argenta, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA - but as many as 60 insurers sold similar products. They will now pay out on many, but not all, policies. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun. ""We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers."" In the lockdown of last spring, many small businesses made claims through business interruption insurance policies for loss of earnings when they had to close. But many insurers refused to pay, arguing only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions. It was agreed that a selection of policy wordings should be tested in court, setting the parameters for what would be considered a valid claim. The ruling provides guidance for a wider pool of 700 policies, potentially affecting 370,000 small businesses - although only some of these will end up with payouts. Giving the court's ruling, Lord Hamblen said the court accepted the arguments from representatives of policyholders and dismissed appeals from insurers against an earlier judgement finding in policyholders' favour. The complex ruling covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings. Staff outside The Drawing Room - one of the businesses affected - in happier times James Ollerenshaw's hair salon was one of those businesses unable to operate during the first national lockdown. The business - The Drawing Room in London's Spitalfields - paid an annual premium of Â£1,200 for business interruption insurance, and disease cover came as part of it. Mr Ollerenshaw said the Supreme Court's decision would not directly affect his policy, but would decide the principles on claims such as his - and were vital for the business. ""A payout would cover the major costs, which is the rent. We have debt sitting there,"" he said. He said he was delighted with the Supreme Court's ruling. ""The insurance industry needs to face up to the fact that it failed customers at their greatest moment of need, destroying companies, livelihoods and jobs,"" he said. He formed a Covid Claims Group, joining other small business owners in calling for a quick resolution and payouts. ""Time matters,"" he said, pointing out that some small businesses have been forced to close down while waiting for the decision. Small firms thrown lifeline in insurance case ruling 'We've spent Â£10,000 on invalid virus insurance' Sheldon Mills, from the FCA, which brought the case on behalf of policyholders, said: ""Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. Today's judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders. ""We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible."" The test case was fast-tracked to the highest court in England and Wales - the Supreme Court, which heard four days of legal representations in November. The final ruling provides authoritative guidance for these policies, and potentially of similar ones not part of the case. The FCA, the insurance sector, and the Financial Ombudsman will all use the judgement to guide their decisions in other cases. The Financial Ombudsman Service and courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to use the judgment to rule on other, similar cases. Insurance policies would have been amended for new and renewing customers since this issue emerged, so losses from the latest lockdown measures in different parts of the UK would be clearly stated as part of the cover - or not - in new business interruption insurance policies.

"UK to close all travel corridors from 04:00 GMT on Monday, PM Boris Johnson said at Downing Street press conference Travellers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 test in previous 72 hours - with new rules in place until at least 15 February More than 2 million people have now died of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University UK government scientists put the coronavirus R number - the average rate of spread - in the UK at 1.2 to 1.3, similar to last week A ban on travellers from South America and Portugal came into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil The health system in the Brazilian city of Manaus is said to be collapsing amid soaring infections linked to the new variant Edited by Sarah Collerton We are going to be closing the live page soon so here's a recap of today's coronavirus headlines:  That's all from the live team but we will be back tomorrow. These updates were brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Sarah Collerton, Vanessa Barford, Emma Harrison, George Wright, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Bisset and Joshua Cheetham. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that the city may run out of coronavirus vaccines next week without a resupply. âIf we donât get a serious supply, weâre going to have to freeze the appointment system,"" he told WNYC radio. ""That would be insane, after all the progress weâve made.â He's the latest official to express concern for vaccine supplies, in a state that was once at the epicentre of America's outbreak and continues to be one of the worst-affected parts of the US. New York State receives about 300,000 doses a week, and a third of these go to New York City, according to officials. But Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that the state would be receiving 50,000 fewer doses next week. While New York City has historically been struggling to administer jabs at scale, the pace picked up this week due to the expansion of vaccination sites, and more people becoming eligible. Between Monday and Thursday, the city administered nearly 120,000 doses. A temporary mortuary that can hold up to 1,300 bodies has been opened in Ruislip, west London, as the capital faces a growing coronavirus death toll. London recently exceeded 10,000 Covid-related deaths, a figure Mayor Sadiq Khan described as ""heartbreaking"". The Breakspear Crematorium facility, which took a week to build and cost about Â£3m, isexpected to receive bodies from Friday. It has been called ""a visual, sobering reminder"" of the continuing cost of the pandemic. Westminster City Council chief executive Stuart Love, who is leading the London-wide response, says: ""We have built this really hoping it doesn't get used to its capacity. ""This just re-emphasises the message of staying at home and looking after your loved ones."" Portugal has entered its second national lockdown, with all non-essential businesses closed. Unlike in the previous lockdown, however, schools will remain open. Measures will also be relaxed for the presidential election, which takes place on 24 January. The new restrictions came into force as Portugal's daily deaths reached 159 on Friday. Infections, meanwhile, were at the second-highest number since the pandemic began, with 10,663 new cases announced the same day. Portugal has recorded more than half a million cases and 8,543 deaths from Covid-19, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Norwegian Air has axed its long haul network due to the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry Airline bosses have said they support the government's decision to close all travel corridors to the UK to prevent the import of new variants of coronavirus. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of
Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers,
said: âTravel
corridors were a lifeline for the industry last summer and the government were
right to bring them in when they did. ""But things change and thereâs no doubting
this is a serious health emergency and ministers need to act to keep borders
safe and the public protected. ""We therefore support this latest measure, on the
assumption that we will work with government â when the time is right â to
remove these restrictions when it is safe to do so and start to open up our
sector again, to support the UKâs economic recovery.â Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that all travel corridors with the UK will be closed from 04:00 GMT on Monday. This means all arrivals to the UK must self-isolate or quarantine for up to 10 days upon arrival to the country (most passengers will also need proof of a negative Covid test too). When it comes to enforcement of the quarantine rules, the latest figures we have show police in England and Wales investigated around 9,000 cases â of reported breaches - in the period to 24 November 2020. The majority â just over 7,000 - needed no further investigation. In almost 1,400 cases, the police were unable to take any action because no-one answered the door or they had the wrong address. Just 223 fines were actually given out. Border Force are also able to hand out fines but we canât find any figures for this. A survey from the Office for National Statistics in October showed that roughly two-thirds of people in England said they were following the quarantine rules. This means the other third said they had breached the rules in some way or another. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government announcement to suspend all UK travel corridors
is the âright stepâ but called the timing of the decision âslow againâ. He says the public will be thinking âwhy on earth didnât this happen
before?"" He also ""urgently"" called for a âlonger term plan for the
airline industryâ going forward and said that the enforcement of isolation upon
arrival needs to be properly addressed, as âthe quarantine hasnât really been
policed effectively at all.â Asked if he forced former Scottish Labour Leader Richard
Leonardâs hand in resigning, Mr Starmer said he wanted to âpay tribute to
Richard and everything he achievedâ and insisted the decision was his alone. The prime minister finished a Downing Street press
conference a short time ago. He was speaking alongside England's chief medical officer
Prof Chris Whitty and the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here are the main takeaways: Asked about reports of deliveries of vaccines being cancelled, the prime minister says the crucial thing is that everyone gets down to their vaccination centre when they get the message to come for their vaccine. ""When we have the problem of some groups or some people not getting the message or perhaps being a bit reluctant to go for one reason or another that we all work to make it clear this is a great thing to do,"" the PM says. He says local councils and public health directors will know where to find people who are hard to reach. ""We have got the Army, we've got pharmacies and we have got the NHS,"" he adds. That marks the end of the press conference. We will bring you a round-up of it shortly. More than two million people have now died with Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University,external. The US has recorded more fatalities than any other country, with almost 390,000 deaths, followed by Brazil and India with around 200,000 and 150,000 deaths respectively. More than 93 million infections have been recorded worldwide. The prime minister says there is ""clearly"" a problem with care home infections and the government is working ""flat-out"" to vaccinate residents and staff. About 40% of elderly residents have received jabs and the hope is that the programme will be complete by the end of January, he adds. In some areas, 80% to 90% of 80-year-olds have received vaccination offers, Boris Johnson says. Sir Patrick Vallance calls it a ""miracle"" that so many vaccines have been developed so quickly. It's too soon to see the effect on transmission yet, but it would be ""very surprising"" if they didn't have a ""decent effect"" in curbing the spread, he says. Sebastian Payne, of the Financial Times, asks what will happen to the rest of society once the most vulnerable are inoculated. Boris Johnson says it is the question which preoccupies most of us at the moment. ""Let's focus for now on getting those cohorts, the JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] groups one-to-four - the over-70s, the over-80s - vaccinated and I think that will already make a huge difference,"" he says. He adds there is a ""debate to be had"" on what happens after that, ""and we will make sure everybody has a chance to have their say"". Asked again about vaccine wastage, Prof Chris Whitty says there have been ""perfectly sensible decisions made by GPs"" to maximise the delivery of vaccines, particularly with the Pfizer vaccine which needs to be stored at -70C. He says the overwhelming volume of vaccines have gone to the over-80s. Speaking earlier at the Downing Street press conference, the prime minister announced the UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Watch here: This video can not be played PM announces that the UK's travel corridors will close The threat of unidentified Covid strains from abroad means tougher action is needed, the PM says. Asked about figures on supply of vaccines and some reports of wastage, Boris Johnson says the key question is ""getting jabs into arms"". Batches have to be tested for safety, he adds, saying that the government is ""using all the supply that we can possibly lay our hands on"". Prof Chris Whitty says he has never said things will get better by Easter, adding the PM may have quoted him as saying that. But he says an improvement is likely at some point during spring. Increasingly, he predicts, the vaccine will do ""more of the heavy lifting"" in dealing with the pandemic. The situation will get ""a lot better than it is now"" in the next few months, Whitty says. Sir Patrick Vallance says a lot of work is going on to ""optimise"" workplace hygiene to prevent infections. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent There have long been calls
for the rules for people arriving into the UK to be tightened up to stop Covid cases being imported. The government only this
month introduced the requirement for proof of a negative Covid test on entry
and other countries have had stricter policies in place for months. With two prominent variants
of the virus - originating in Brazil and South Africa - already on the
governmentâs radar, ministers seem determined to get ahead of any others that
may yet pose a risk. ITV's Libby Wiener asks if the move to put restrictions in at the borders is too late. The PM says the government is taking steps to protect against the new variants. ""We have a situation now where we have a very high rate of domestic infection in the UK combined with a vaccination programme,"" he says. ""There will come a point in the next weeks and months where the vaccination programme will take effect... and you will see a decline in the death rate. ""What you can't have is a situation where you have new variants with unknown qualities coming in from abroad and that's why we have set up the system to stop arrivals where new variants are a concern."" Sir Patrick Vallance says the virus is changing all the time and he suspects there are variants ""all over the world of different types"". ""The countries which have detected them first have got good sequencing,"" he says. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says some hospitals in London and south-eastern England are so busy they're having to move patients hundreds of miles and asks how the NHS is set to cope over the next few weeks. The PM says the NHS in London has been coping ""magnificently"" and intensive care units are not yet overwhelmed. There are ""tentative early signs that the pressure might be easing slightly"" in the capital but it's too early to be confident of that. Prof Chris Whitty says the hope is that infections have already peaked in some areas of the country, but the peak of hospitalisations is delayed until about a week after infections, with the peak of deaths later still. The peak of deaths is, he says, likely to be in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says the measures in place must remain in place to suppress the figures. Michael from Cornwall asks at what rate of deaths and infections the government will lift lockdown restrictions. The prime minister says the government wants to get to a stage where the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. ""Depending on the effectiveness of that roll-out, and we are hoping to do all of them by the 15 February, we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions, but it will also depend on where the disease is and what's happening,"" he says. ""We can't have any false sense of security so that we lift the restrictions all together and then the disease really runs riot in the younger generations,"" Mr Johnson adds. Prof Whitty says we will not ""move from a sudden lockdown situation to nothing"". Asked about plans for any future variant that may be more easily transmissable, the PM says a lot of scientific work is being done on keeping vaccines updated. He adds that the ""tough"" measures at borders and airports will also help this effort. Sir Patrick Vallance says there's a ""very comprehensive"" method used to keep up with developments. The new UK variant transmits more readily but there's nothing to suggest it's more intense. Other variants may get round vaccines in the future, he adds, but scientists ""don't know that"". Vaccines are ""really quite easy to adjust"", thanks to recent developments, Sir Patrick adds. It's also likely that vaccines used now will protect against new variants, he says. Prof Chris Whitty stresses the need for international co-operation on vaccines to keep ahead of variants that develop. Prof Whitty says deaths will continue to rise into next week because of the lag between people going into hospital and then some dying. But he says the effects of everyone's actions will begin to reduce ""this strong pressure"" on the NHS, along with the vaccination of the most vulnerable. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Rescuers pull a woman from the rubble after the 6.2 magnitude earthquake A powerful earthquake has rocked Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 42 people, with more feared dead as rescuers search for survivors. The 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday morning, just hours after an earlier, smaller tremor. Hundreds of people were injured and thousands displaced by the quake. Indonesia has a history of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, withmore than 2,000 killed in a 2018 Sulawesi quake. Eight people died when the five-storey Mitra Manakarra Hospital in Mamuju partially collapsed on Friday, officials said. About 60 people were safely evacuated from the hospital. ""It happened so quickly, around 10 seconds,"" Syamsu Ridwan, a local police spokesman, told the BBC. He said the power in the hospital cut out during the earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will increase as rescue efforts continue. Rescuers were still searching for survivors late on Friday, but they have been hampered by power cuts and poor mobile phone service. Indonesian President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims, urging people to stay calm and for the authorities to step up search efforts. Earthquake 'hack' reveals scale of ocean warming New equation âcould predict earthquakes betterâ The epicentre of Friday's quake was six kilometres (3.73 miles) northeast of Majene city at a depth of 10km. Video footage on social media showed collapsed houses and a girl pinned under rubble calling for help. The situation was ""pretty bad"", Dr Gayatri Marliyani, of the geology department at Gajah Mada University in Yogyakarta, told the BBC. She said the governor's office was among the collapsed buildings and confirmed that several hospitals and one hotel had also been damaged. She also warned that getting response teams to the area could be hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. Indonesia has a history of devastating quakes Tremors were felt at around 01:00 local time on Friday (17:00 Thursday GMT) for about seven seconds. No tsunami warning was issued but thousands are reported to have left their homes, fleeing to safety. Authorities have warned that strong aftershocks could follow the two main quakes and that they could still trigger a tsunami. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the so-called Ring of Fire - a line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions on the Pacific rim. In 2004, a tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatrakilled 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. The Indian Oceantsunami of 2004 killed 170,000 people on the Indonesian island of Sumatraafter a quake of magnitude 9.1. Are you in the area?

"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has denied reports that his department is planning to dilute UK workers' rights. It comes after the Financial Times said some protections brought in under EU law - such as the 48-hour limit on the working week - could be scrapped. New rules on rest breaks and changes to how holiday pay is calculated from overtime could be proposed, it added. But Mr Kwarteng insisted he wanted to ""protect and enhance workers' rights going forward, not row back on them"". In a social media post, he said that the UK ""has one of the best workers' rights records in the world - going further than the EU in many areas."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour said the newspaper report suggested the government was out of step with public feeling on workplace rules. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""These proposals are not about cutting red tape for businesses but ripping up vital rights for workers. They should not even be up for discussion."" The FT said,externalthe proposals were being drawn up with the approval of Downing Street, but that they hadn't yet been approved by ministers or cabinet. A government spokesperson said: ""We have absolutely no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights. ""The UK has one of the best workers' rights records in the world, and it is well known that the UK goes further than the EU in many areas. ""Leaving the EU allows us to continue to be a standard setter and protect and enhance UK workers' rights."" When the UK left the EU it retained many of its laws, but it is now able to change them. One aspect of EU employment regulation is the EU's Working Time Directive. It governs the hours employees in the EU can be asked to work. This must not exceed 48 hours on average, including any overtime. But employees can choose to opt out of the 48-hour week,external, if they often work overtime in roles in the emergency services, for example. In the 2019 Queen's Speech outlining the government's agenda for the coming parliamentary session, changes in employment law were promised. A new Employment Bill is expected to be published in 2021. One issue it is thought  it will address is over the distribution of tips. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady urged the prime minister to ""make good on his promises to his voters"" on Friday. ""The best way to do that is to bring forward the long-awaited Employment Bill, to make sure everyone is treated fairly at work,"" she said. What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights?

"The government is assessing the impact of a ""technical issue"" that led to 150,000 records being deleted from police databases. The error,first reported in the Times,,externalsaw data including fingerprint, DNA and arrest histories wiped after being accidentally flagged for deletion. The Home Office said the lost entries related to people who were arrested and then released without further action. But Labour said it presented ""huge dangers"" for public safety. The data was lost from the Police National Computer - a system that stores and shares criminal records information across the UK. It is used to help police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. A coding error resulted in records that had been flagged for deletion being lost from the database before checks had been carried out to determine whether they could be lawfully held or not. The data loss could hinder future police investigations because the fingerprint or DNA evidence would not be able to be cross-checked against evidence from other crime scenes. Policing minister Kit Malthouse said the problem had been identified and the process corrected so ""it cannot happen again"" - with the Home Office, National Police Chiefs' Council and other law enforcement partners working ""at pace"" to recover the data. ""While the loss relates to individuals who were arrested and then released with no further action, I have asked officials and the police to confirm their initial assessment that there is no threat to public safety,"" he said. The Home Office said no records of criminal or dangerous persons had been deleted. The records are linked to police investigations that were terminated before charge (No Further Action or NFA cases) or to those where an individual had been acquitted at court. It is not yet known how many records of each type were lost and full extent of deletions is still being investigated. The loss of the data means that officers on the ground may get an incomplete search result when interrogating the system. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Home Secretary Priti Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had. ""She must urgently make a statement about what has gone wrong, the extent of the issue, and what action is being taken to reassure the public. Answers must be given."" ""This is an extraordinarily serious security breach that presents huge dangers for public safety."" Former Cumbria Police chief constable Stuart Hyde told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""very large"" loss of arrest records presented a ""risk to public safety"". He said: ""In order to understand the scale, if you think that about between 6-700,000 people are arrested every year in the UK, that's a very large proportion of those people."" It comes after around 40,000 alerts relating to European criminals were removed from the same database, the PNC, following Britain's post-Brexit deal with the EU.

"This video can not be played At Fullwell Cross Medical Centre, north London, they are now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Fake news is likely to be causing some people from the UK's South Asian communities to reject the Covid vaccine, a doctor has warned. Dr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive, said it was ""a big concern"" and officials were working ""to correct so much fake news"". He said language and cultural barriers played a part in the false information. A GP in the West Midlands told the BBC some of her South Asian patients had refused the vaccine when offered it. Dr Sood, from NHS England, said officials were working with South Asian role models, influencers, community leaders and religious leaders to help debunk myths about the vaccine. Much of the disinformation surrounds the contents of the vaccine. He said: ""We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine, it has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities."" ""We're trying to find role models and influencers and also thinking about ordinary citizens who need to be quick with this information so that they can all support one another because ultimately everyone is a role model to everyone"", he added. ""There's a big piece of work happening where we're translating information, we're making sure the look and feel of it reaches the populations that matter."" WhatsApp rumours fear over BAME vaccine take up Clinics urge Asian community to take up vaccine The vaccines explained in five South Asian languages Some of the disinformation seen by the BBC on social media and on WhatsApp is religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims, as does eating beef for Hindus. Dr Samara Afzal has been vaccinating people in Dudley, West Midlands. She said: ""We've been calling all patients and booking them in for vaccines but the admin staff say when they call a lot of the South Asian patients they decline and refuse to have the vaccination. ""Also talking to friends and family have found the same. I've had friends calling me telling me to convince their parents or their grandparents to have the vaccination because other family members have convinced them not to have it"". Reena Pujara is a beauty therapist in Hampshire and a practising Hindu. She said she's been bombarded with false information. ""Some of the videos are quite disturbing especially when you actually see the person reporting is a medic and telling you that the vaccine is going to alter your DNA,"" she said. ""For a layman it is very confusing. And also when you read that the ingredients in the vaccine derive from a cow - and as Hindus the cow is sacred to us - it is disturbing."" About 100 mosques have a joined a campaign to counter vaccine disinformation and persuade their communities to take the vaccine. They've said they'll use their Friday sermons to urge people to have the jab. ""There should be no hesitation in taking [the vaccine] from a moral perspective,"" said Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB), which has organised the campaign. ""It is our ethical duty to protect ourselves and others from harm."" Why 'disappearing' vaccine needles aren't a scam No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Asian Network that faith and community leaders had a big role to play in ensuring a high take-up of the vaccine. He said he had met with more than 150 leaders from Sikh, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim communities who were taking the message out ""that it's the right thing to do"". He added that the government was taking steps to tackle online disinformation around the vaccine, as well as making sure vaccine guidance was available in many different languages. A recent poll, commissioned by the Royal Society of Public Health, suggested just over half of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people would be happy to have the coronavirus vaccine.

"Footballer Marcus Rashford has led campaigns over child poverty Marcus Rashford and a group of celebrity chefs and campaigners have called on Boris Johnson to review the government's free school meals policy. The group, including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tom Kerridge,have written to the PM,externalasking him to ""fix"" the system long-term. They called for a strategy to help ""end child food poverty"" before the summer holidays. No 10 said ""no child will ever go hungry"" because of the Covid pandemic. The call for a wide review comes after another row over free school mealsduring February half-term. The government has said food will be provided to children by councils under the Covid Winter Grant Scheme while schools are closed for the holiday. Councils and unions say the government should provide food vouchers instead, with the Local Government Association's Councillor Richard Watts telling BBC Radio 4's PM programme the grant had already been allocated for other support. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are down to semantics whether it is the school delivering the meal or whether it is the local authority - fortunately there is quite a lot of different support available."" What should be in free school meals? Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel How many children need free meals? As well as getting the backing of Rashford - who has led campaigns around child poverty over the course of the pandemic - the letter has been signed by chefs Oliver, Kerridge and Fearnley-Whittingstall, along with actor Dame Emma Thompson and over 40 charities and education leaders. Organised by the Food Foundation charity,the letter,externalsaid it was time to ""step back and review the policy in more depth"". They called for an ""urgent comprehensive review into free school meal policy across the UK"" to feed into the government's next Spending Review, saying it should look at: the threshold for being eligible for free school meals funding - including whether the current allowance is enough how schools can be helped to provide the best quality meals the impact of Covid on children in low-income families making sure there is no stigma The signatories praised the Department for Education's ""swift response"" toreports earlier this week of inadequate food parcels sent to families, saying the ""robustness of the message from you and the secretary of state on this issue was very welcome"". But, they added that ""following the series of problems which have arisen over school food vouchers, holiday provision and food parcels since the start of the pandemic"", now was the time for a review. This video can not be played Tom Kerridge: There has to be a solution to free school meals Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen ""crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals"". ""The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing."" Chef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. ""We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,"" he told the same programme. The signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. ""We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,"" the letter said. ""School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. ""Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step."" Anti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: ""We need to be feeding children right now."" She added: ""While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. ""This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon.

"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November as England was placed in lockdown for a second time, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics said,externalit meant gross domestic product was 8.5% below its pre-pandemic peak. November's decline came after six consecutive months of growth. Pubs and hairdressers were badly hit as the service sector suffered, the ONS said, but some manufacturing and construction activity improved. The hit to the service sector - which accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy - meant it contracted by 3.4% in November, and is now 9.9% below the level of February 2020. Some economists said the November figure was better than expected, and it appeared many companies were better prepared for the second lockdown, with some sectors staying open for business and many firms having already put in place plans to expand online operations. ""Steps taken by businesses earlier in the year to Covid-proof their operations - combined with the time-limited nature of the restrictions, and schools remaining open - meant more companies were able to continue trading safely,"" said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI employers' group. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed ""it's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face"". But he said the vaccine roll-out and economic support measures meant there were reasons to be hopeful. ""With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the figures showed the UK has an economic ""mountain to climb"". Speaking to the BBC, she said it would be a ""serious mistake"" if Mr Sunak waited until the Budget in March before providing more support and confidence for business. ONS director for economic statistics Darren Morgan said: ""The economy took a hit from restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic during November, with pubs and hairdressers seeing the biggest impact."" However, he said many firms adjusted to the new pandemic working conditions, such as by expanding click and collect and other online operations. He added: ""Manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, while schools also stayed open, meaning the impact on the economy was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown. ""Car manufacturing, bolstered by demand from abroad, housebuilding and infrastructure grew and are now all above their pre-pandemic levels."" Construction activity grew by 1.9% during the month. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Despite the GDP figure being better than some analysts had forecast, there are still concerns that the UK could be heading back into recession. Economists have warned the UK could see a double-dip recession if restrictions remain in place in the first three months of 2021. Rory Macqueen, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the November figures confirm a significant slowdown in the last quarter of 2020, ""despite November's lockdown in England clearly having a far smaller effect than the first"". James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said there would be a lot of comment about whether these figures point to the UK heading for only its second-ever double-dip recession on record. But, he said, the real ""story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure"". ""The chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease,"" he added. Retail sales in 2020 'worst for 25 years' UK economy 'to get worse before it gets better' Analysts at Capital Economics also said there was cause for optimism, saying that the current third lockdown could have less impact than feared. ""The economy has built up a fair bit of immunity to lockdowns, as November's lockdown was much less painful for the economy than the first lockdown. ""As a result, the Covid-19 economic hole is smaller than we thought, the economy may get back to its pre-crisis crisis level a bit sooner and it makes us more confident that the Bank of England probably won't resort to negative interest rates."" The fall in the economy in November was still considerable, but the figures show businesses adapting to difficult conditions. The hit was a fraction of what occurred in the first lockdown last April, and was mainly confined to the service sector, with pubs and hairdressing for example in sharp decline. Manufacturing and construction largely remained open, as did previously shut public services such as schools. By November car manufacturing and house building were back above the level of output before the pandemic. The trade figures also showed a Â£7bn increase in EU imports in the three months to November as traders stockpiled car parts, medicines and other goods ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period. The renewed regional tiered restrictions in December, and more severe national lockdowns this month, still indicate a possible return to overall recession in this tough winter. Business groups continue to argue that extra support is required to support jobs and cash flow well before the Budget in March. But a more sustained lifting of restrictions as vaccines are rolled out should see growth return after the spring. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"The governor of Amazonas state warned of a ""critical"" moment and has implemented a curfew Hospitals in the Brazilian city of Manaus have reached breaking point while treating Covid-19 patients, amid reports of severe oxygen shortages and desperate staff. The city, in Amazonas state, has seen a surge of deaths and infections. Health professionals, quoted by local media, warned ""many people"" could die due to lack of supplies and assistance. Brazil has recorded more than 205,000 virus deaths - the second-highest tally in the world, behind the US. A new coronavirus variant has recently emerged in Brazil, with several cases in travellers arriving in Japan traced back to the Amazonas region. Amazonas suffered heavy losses in the first wave of the pandemic but is also being badly hit by a new rise in infections. Refrigerated containers were brought to hospitals to help store bodies last week, as authorities declared a state of emergency. Jessem Orellana, from the Fiocruz-Amazonia scientific investigation institute, told the AFP news agency that some hospitals in Manaus had ""run out of oxygen"" with some centres becoming ""a type of suffocation chamber"" for patients. The researcher told Brazilian media she had received reports from the front-line of ""dramatic"" scenes playing out in some hospitals. How worrying are the new variants? Brazil's president: Unlikely Covid hero? The realities of schooling in rural Brazil Reports in the daily Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper described desperate staff having to try to keep patients alive through manual ventilation. In a widely shared video from the region, a female medical worker asks the internet for help: ""We're in an awful state. Oxygen has simply run out across the whole unit today."" ""There is no oxygen and lots of people are dying,""she says in the clip,external.  ""If anyone has any oxygen, please bring it to the clinic. There are so many people dying."" The UK has banned travellers from much of Latin America over a new variant detected in Brazil Amazonas Governor Wilson Lima said the state was ""in the most critical moment of the pandemic"" and has announced a nightly curfew will begin at 19:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday to try to stem the spread. Marcellus Campelo, a local health secretary, said the state needed three times the amount of oxygen it can produce locally and appealed for help. Brazil's vice-president shared images on Twitter of the air force transporting hospital supplies, including oxygen cylinders and stretchers, to the city as reports of the situation spread throughout the country.

Health officials also say some patients will be airlifted to other states for treatment due to the demand for intensive care units, Reuters reports. Felipe Naveca, deputy director of research at the state-run Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, told the BBC's South America correspondent Katy Watson that the new variant had evolved separately from those in the UK and South Africa, but that it showed some of the same characteristics: ""Some of these mutations have been linked to increased transmission and that is of concern."" Mr Naveca said that they did not yet have any data to suggest that existing vaccines would be any less effective against the new variant. ""We have to do a lot more sequencing of samples to answer that question,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-un has been overseeing a huge military showcase broadcast by state media in North Korea North Korea has unveiled a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile, described by state media as ""the world's most powerful weapon"". Several of the missiles were displayed at a parade overseen by leader Kim Jong-un, reported state media. The weapon's actual capabilities remain unclear, as it is not known to have been tested. The show of military strength comes days before the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president. It also follows a rare political meeting where Mr Kim decried the US as his country's ""biggest enemy"". Images released by North Korean state media showed at least four large black-and-white missiles being driven past flag-waving crowds. North Korea throws the gauntlet down for Biden Kim vows to expand North Korea's nuclear arsenal North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Profile: Kim Jong-un Analysts noted it was a previously unseen weapon. ""New year, new Pukguksong,"" tweeted North Korea expert Ankit Panda, using the North Korean name for their submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Clad in a leather coat and fur hat, Mr Kim is pictured smiling and waving as he watched the display in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, which also included infantry troops, artillery and tanks. The missile was debuted at a military parade which came at the end of an important and rare political meeting ""The world's most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missile, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces,"" the official Korean Central News Agency said. The event on Thursday did not showcase North Korea's largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),which was unveiled at a much larger military parade in October. That colossal weapon is believed to be able to deliver a nuclear warhead to anywhere in the US, and its size had surprised even seasoned analysts when it was put on show last year. What we know about North Korea's huge new missile The country's latest display of its arsenal comes at the end of a five-yearly congress of the ruling Workers' Party. In his address to members last week, Mr Kim had pledged to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons and military potential, outlining a list of desired weapons including long-range ballistic missiles capable of being launched from land or sea and ""super-large warheads"". He also said that the US was Pyongyang's ""biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy... no matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change"". Under Mr Kim's leadership North Korea has made rapid progress in its weapons programme, which it says is necessary to defend itself against a possible US invasion. The unveiling of the new missiles appears designed to send the incoming Biden administration a message of the North's growing military prowess, say experts. ""They'd like us to notice that they're getting more proficient with larger solid rocket boosters,"" Mr Panda tweeted, noting what appeared to be new solid-fuel short-range ballistic missiles on display too. These missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuelled varieties. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Over the last four years, Pyongyang has had an erratic relationship with the US under President Donald Trump's administration. Mr Kim and Mr Trump engaged in mutual insults and threats of war before an unprecedented summit in Singapore in 2018 anddeclarations of love by the outgoing US leader. Despite the apparent warming of relations, little concrete progress was made on negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme anda second summit in Hanoi in 2019 broke down after the US refused Pyongyang's demands for sanctions relief. Kim Jong-un has had a busy week. In this rare party congress at the start of a new year he's earned a new title, pledged to build new nuclear weapons and now he's shown the world some new missiles. The general secretary, the title posthumously awarded to his father by which he is now known, had been pretty quiet in 2020 and appeared very few times in state media. But 2021 is looking rather different. The party congress has offered him a grand daily domestic platform - even if it is not getting the international attention it may have done due to events in the United States and a global pandemic. The parading vehicles include a new submarine-launched ballistic missile and new short-range ballistic missiles. This is a show of strength - flexing the military muscle once more to show the people of North Korea that despite the current bleak economic outlook, this impoverished country is capable of designing and building new strategic weapons. It also offers a direct challenge to the incoming US administration. North Korea appears willing to continue with its self-imposed isolation and being subject to strict economic sanctions, and the state has vowed to continue to build nuclear weapons in defiance of the international community. During the transfer of power, President Obama told Donald Trump that North Korea should be his top national security concern. In the last four years a combination of US and UN sanctions, so-called ""maximum pressure"" policies and three summits between Mr Trump and Mr Kim have done nothing to alleviate those concerns. Kim Jong-un has shown the new US president this week that he faces the daunting prospect of coming up with new solutions for this decades-old problem.

"This video can not be played At Fullwell Cross Medical Centre, north London, they are now vaccinating almost 1,000 people a week Fake news is likely to be causing some people from the UK's South Asian communities to reject the Covid vaccine, a doctor has warned. Dr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive, said it was ""a big concern"" and officials were working ""to correct so much fake news"". He said language and cultural barriers played a part in the false information. A GP in the West Midlands told the BBC some of her South Asian patients had refused the vaccine when offered it. Dr Sood, from NHS England, said officials were working with South Asian role models, influencers, community leaders and religious leaders to help debunk myths about the vaccine. Much of the disinformation surrounds the contents of the vaccine. He said: ""We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine, it has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities."" ""We're trying to find role models and influencers and also thinking about ordinary citizens who need to be quick with this information so that they can all support one another because ultimately everyone is a role model to everyone"", he added. ""There's a big piece of work happening where we're translating information, we're making sure the look and feel of it reaches the populations that matter."" WhatsApp rumours fear over BAME vaccine take up Clinics urge Asian community to take up vaccine The vaccines explained in five South Asian languages Some of the disinformation seen by the BBC on social media and on WhatsApp is religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims, as does eating beef for Hindus. Dr Samara Afzal has been vaccinating people in Dudley, West Midlands. She said: ""We've been calling all patients and booking them in for vaccines but the admin staff say when they call a lot of the South Asian patients they decline and refuse to have the vaccination. ""Also talking to friends and family have found the same. I've had friends calling me telling me to convince their parents or their grandparents to have the vaccination because other family members have convinced them not to have it"". Reena Pujara is a beauty therapist in Hampshire and a practising Hindu. She said she's been bombarded with false information. ""Some of the videos are quite disturbing especially when you actually see the person reporting is a medic and telling you that the vaccine is going to alter your DNA,"" she said. ""For a layman it is very confusing. And also when you read that the ingredients in the vaccine derive from a cow - and as Hindus the cow is sacred to us - it is disturbing."" About 100 mosques have a joined a campaign to counter vaccine disinformation and persuade their communities to take the vaccine. They've said they'll use their Friday sermons to urge people to have the jab. ""There should be no hesitation in taking [the vaccine] from a moral perspective,"" said Qari Asim, chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB), which has organised the campaign. ""It is our ethical duty to protect ourselves and others from harm."" Why 'disappearing' vaccine needles aren't a scam No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Asian Network that faith and community leaders had a big role to play in ensuring a high take-up of the vaccine. He said he had met with more than 150 leaders from Sikh, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim communities who were taking the message out ""that it's the right thing to do"". He added that the government was taking steps to tackle online disinformation around the vaccine, as well as making sure vaccine guidance was available in many different languages. A recent poll, commissioned by the Royal Society of Public Health, suggested just over half of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people would be happy to have the coronavirus vaccine. It found 57% said they would take the vaccine - compared with 79% of white people.

This video can not be played Tom Kerridge: There has to be a solution to free school meals Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation charity, said the last few months had seen ""crisis after crisis with the provision of free school meals"". ""The result of that is disadvantaged children have often paid the price,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Our view is that really unless we do a root and branch review these problems are going to still keep appearing."" Chef Fearnley-Whittingstall also called for a more consistent, long-term response to the issue of food poverty. ""We need to get out of this fire-fighting, highly reactive series of actions by the government,"" he told the same programme. The signatories want a review to be published and debated in Parliament before the 2021 summer holidays. ""We are ready and willing to support your government in whatever way we can to make this review a reality and to help develop a set of recommendations that everyone can support,"" the letter said. ""School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of our most disadvantaged children. ""Now, at a time when children have missed months of in-school learning and the pandemic has reminded us of the importance of our health, this is a vital next step."" Anti-poverty campaigner and food writer Jack Monroe welcomed the letter to the PM, but told the BBC: ""We need to be feeding children right now."" She added: ""While it is great to be looking longer term... having an underpinning strategy that means that children aren't put into poverty in the first place, we need to also immediately be putting resources in to ensure people aren't going hungry, today, tonight, next week and in the February half-term. ""This isn't a rhetorical thing. It isn't a dinner party discussion. We need to be doing this now."" A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""It is great that celebrities and groups across society see the importance of school food. The PM thanks Marcus Rashford for his letter and will reply soon. ""School food is essential in supporting the health and learning of the most disadvantaged pupils. The prime minister has been clear that no child will ever go hungry as a result of the pandemic"".

"This video can not be played Rescuers pull a woman from the rubble after the 6.2 magnitude earthquake A powerful earthquake has rocked Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 42 people, with more feared dead as rescuers search for survivors. The 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday morning, just hours after an earlier, smaller tremor. Hundreds of people were injured and thousands displaced by the quake. Indonesia has a history of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, withmore than 2,000 killed in a 2018 Sulawesi quake. Eight people died when the five-storey Mitra Manakarra Hospital in Mamuju partially collapsed on Friday, officials said. About 60 people were safely evacuated from the hospital. ""It happened so quickly, around 10 seconds,"" Syamsu Ridwan, a local police spokesman, told the BBC. He said the power in the hospital cut out during the earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will increase as rescue efforts continue. Rescuers were still searching for survivors late on Friday, but they have been hampered by power cuts and poor mobile phone service. Indonesian President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims, urging people to stay calm and for the authorities to step up search efforts. Earthquake 'hack' reveals scale of ocean warming New equation âcould predict earthquakes betterâ The epicentre of Friday's quake was six kilometres (3.73 miles) northeast of Majene city at a depth of 10km. Video footage on social media showed collapsed houses and a girl pinned under rubble calling for help. The situation was ""pretty bad"", Dr Gayatri Marliyani, of the geology department at Gajah Mada University in Yogyakarta, told the BBC. She said the governor's office was among the collapsed buildings and confirmed that several hospitals and one hotel had also been damaged. She also warned that getting response teams to the area could be hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. Indonesia has a history of devastating quakes Tremors were felt at around 01:00 local time on Friday (17:00 Thursday GMT) for about seven seconds. No tsunami warning was issued but thousands are reported to have left their homes, fleeing to safety. Authorities have warned that strong aftershocks could follow the two main quakes and that they could still trigger a tsunami. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the so-called Ring of Fire - a line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions on the Pacific rim. In 2004, a tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatrakilled 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. The Indian Oceantsunami of 2004 killed 170,000 people on the Indonesian island of Sumatraafter a quake of magnitude 9.1. Are you in the area?

"Jon Schaffer, pictured wearing a blue jacket, was seen in news photos taken during the riot Exactly 100 days since the 6 January riot that saw a pro-Trump mob storm the US Capitol, prosecutors have their first guilty plea. Jon Schaffer, 53, a member of the Oath Keepers militia group, pleaded guilty to two charges - obstruction of an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a dangerous weapon. Schaffer, who is also a heavy metal guitarist in the band Iced Earth, had originally faced six charges including using a chemical irritant designed for grizzly bears on police officers during clashes. He turned himself to FBI agents in Indiana two weeks after his arrest, and after a photo of him inside the Capitol wearing a hat reading ""Oath Keepers Lifetime Member"" appeared on the front pages of US newspapers. He is facing 30 years in prison and is expected to co-operate with investigators. The suspects in the Capitol riot are a varied group: they include an ousted West Virginia lawmaker, several police officers and a left-wing activist from Utah. Most of the rioters were allowed to leave the crime scene, forcing investigators to conduct a national manhunt for the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the halls of Congress. Investigators for the District of Columbia says they have identified over 540 suspects and charged some 400 people in connection with the Capitol siege. Just weeks after the rampage in January, FBI officials said they had already been inundated with 140,000 videos and photos from members of the public. Officials say they are considering filing serious charges of seditious activity against some individuals who were involved in the siege on the Capitol. According to federal criminal code, seditious conspiracy means an effort to conspire to overthrow the US government. The punishment is severe: up to 20 years in prison. The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters Jacob Anthony Chansley wore horns and a fur hat inside the Senate chamber The rioters facing federal charges hail from 42 out of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to theGeorge Washington University extremism tracker,external. Only a few came from pro-Trump strongholds. Most came from districts that voted for Joe Biden in the November election. In March, the FBI made its first arrest of a Trump appointee, former State Department aide Federico Guillermo Klein. Mr Klein, 42, is accused of multiple felonies related to the riot, including beating police with a stolen riot shield. He was still employed by the State Department as a staff assistant when he joined the mob on 6 January. He is also a former Trump campaign employee, US media report. Five of those arrested were police officers. Nearly 30 were active-duty or retired members of the military. Five revelations from Capitol riot arrests About 90% of those arrested have been white, according to an analysis by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Most have been over the age of 40, surprising given that the average age for those involved in political violence around the world is late 20s to early 30s. Many of those arrested were employed, or even wealthy, including Dr Simone Gold, 55, from Beverly Hills, California. She was among a group of doctors that last year spread misleading claims about the coronavirus, including that hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted relentlessly by Mr Trump - was an effective treatment. Jenna Ryan - a real estate broker from Dallas, Texas - garnered attention on social media after she flew to DC by private jet to join the march to the Capitol. Analysis by BBC Monitoring and BBC Reality Check Robert Keith Packer One of the most striking images from that day showed a man wearing a hoodie with the words: ""Camp Auschwitz"". Auschwitz was a Nazi extermination camp where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were murdered during World War Two by Germany. Mr Packer was arrested in Virginia and has been charged with trespassing in a federal building and ""violent entry and disorderly conduct"" on Capitol grounds. Mr Packer wore a garment with the slogan ""Camp Auschwitz"" Jake Angeli - 'Q Shaman' Jacob Anthony Chansley, known as Jake Angeli or as he describes himself the ""Q Shaman"", is a well-known follower of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory who lives in Glendale, Arizona. QAnon supporters believe Mr Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. Known for appearing with a painted face, fur hat and horns while carrying a ""Q sent me"" banner in public, Mr Chansley, 33, has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct after appearing in multiple images inside the halls of Congress and the Senate chamber. In videos posted to his social media accounts, he shouts about child-trafficking in front of government buildings or inside shopping malls, and attends pro-Trump or QAnon-linked ""save our children"" rallies. Like many of his fellow QAnon followers, Mr Chansley says he believes Covid-19 is a hoax. Mr Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as ""people who love our country."" Officer Eugene Goodman confronts Doug Jensen Doug Jensen - QAnon Doug Jensen, 41, from Des Moines, Iowa, appeared in one video showing a lone African American officer holding back the mob. Mr Jensen has been arrested and faces five federal charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct and obstructing a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder. In it, he can be seen chasing a police officer up a flight of stairs inside the Capitol wearing a shirt with the QAnon slogan ""trust the plan"". The Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero' Mr Jensen later identified himself on his Twitter account, tweeting: ""You like my shirt?"" and ""Meâ¦"" under images of him inside the Capitol shared by fellow QAnon supporters. On his Twitter, Mr Jensen regularly expresses support for President Trump, engages with well-known QAnon accounts, and tweets QAnon phrases such as WWG1WGA - short for ""where we go one we go all"" - a rallying cry for the conspiracy's adherents. Nick Ochs - Proud Boys Nick Ochs was arrested at an airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, by the FBI, as he returned home from Washington DC. He's accused of unlawful entry of restricted buildings or grounds, after he posted a picture smoking a cigarette inside the Capitol building, tweeting: ""Hello from the Capital lol"". Mr Ochs describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii"". The Proud Boys is an anti-immigrant and all male far-right group founded in 2016. President Trump addressed this group specifically in the first presidential debate. In response to a question about white supremacists and militias he said: ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by."" Richard Barnett Richard Barnett is the man pictured with his feet on a desk in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. He was also pictured outside the Capitol with a personalised envelope he took from her office. He's been arrested for unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of public money, property, or records. Mr Barnett is 60 years old and from Arkansas. Local media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally following the presidential election - the movement that supports Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Derrick Evans Less than a month after he was sworn in as a Republican delegate in the West Virginia state legislature, Mr Evans filmed himself pushing through the crowd as he stormed the Capitol wearing what appears to be a motorcycle helmet. ""We're going in,"" he said in the now-deleted Facebook live stream. ""We did it! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!"" he yelled, adding, ""patriots inside, baby!"" His participation in the riot led lawmakers in his home state to consider cutting off his access to the West Virginia statehouse. But within a week of the riot, he had resigned. He is facing federal charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct. Riley June Williams tried to delete her accounts, prosecutors say Riley June Williams The 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman, is accused of stealing a laptop from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The FBI has said that Ms Williams' former romantic partner told them that she had appeared in pictures of the Capitol riot. She allegedly had said that she hoped to sell the laptop to Russian intelligence agents. An aide to Mrs Pelosi said the computer was only used for presentations. It has yet to be recovered by investigators. Federal cases are ongoing across the country and could lead to some significant prison sentences for those involved. Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in February: ""The scope and scale of this investigation in these cases are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably [Department of Justice] history."" Dozens of suspects have requested public defenders - lawyers provided by the government - leaving taxpayers to pay millions of dollars in defendants' legal bills. The cases have also flooded the Washington DC legal system, where semi-returned judges have been called upon to hear the influx of cases. At least one defendant has argued that their case should be heard out of Washington because they would be unable to get a fair trial there. At least seven of the key suspects have told investigators that they travelled to the Capitol after President Trump told them to go in a speech that preceded the riot. The so-called Q Shaman requested a pardon from Mr Trump before he left office, citing ""the peaceful and compliant fashion in which Mr Chansley comported himself"" during the riot. According to a local ABC news station, a judge has agreed that Mr Chansley should be ""provided food in line with a shaman's strict organic diet"" after he refused to eat the meals provided at the jailhouse. Riley June Williams, the woman accused of stealing a congressional laptop, was ordered to stay off the internet after she allegedly attempted to delete her information and encouraged others to do the same. A man allegedly seen in viral photos carrying a Confederate flag in the Capitol during the riots was charged on 14 January. Authorities in Delaware charged Kevin Seefried and his son Hunter with entering a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct. According to court documentscited by the Delaware News Journal,external, the duo got into the Capitol building through a window that Hunter helped break, before they ""verbally confronted"" US Capitol Police officers and the son took a selfie. TheConfederate flagis widely seen as a racist symbol as it was the banner of the slaveholding southern states that lost the US Civil War (1861-65). A left-wing activist was also arrested after tweeting video of himself inside the US Capitol as protesters breached security. John Sullivan, 26, was charged with entering a restricted building and violent entry or disorderly conduct. He claimed in media interviews that he was just ""documenting"" the rampage, though the affidavit notes he has no press credentials. The court document,externalsays Mr Sullivan can be heard saying in a video he filmed of the Capitol riot: ""Let's burn this shit down."" He has identified himself in media interviews as a Black Lives Matter supporter, but rejects any association with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left protesters. Following the death of George Floyd last year, Mr Sullivan founded an activist group in Utah that advocates for racial justice. He was charged in July 2020 with felony riot and criminal mischief over civil unrest in Provo, Utah. Two men who were allegedly pictured bringing plastic restraints into the Capitol were also arrested this month. Authorities say Eric Gavelek Munchel is the individual seen carrying a number of plastic zip ties inside the Senate chamber. He was detained in Tennessee. Larry Rendell Brock, who is accused of entering the Capitol with a white flex cuff - a restraining device used by law enforcement - was arrested in Texas. So far, neither has been accused of plotting to use the restraints, but face disorderly conduct and violent entry charges.

"Doctors fear the impact of the lockdown and school closures could worsen child obesity The health board with the worst child obesity rates in Wales is setting up a unit to tackle the issue. Data from theChild Measurement Programme,externalshowed 30.3% of four and five-year-olds in north Wales measured as overweight or obese. The Welsh average is 26.4%, but doctors fear this could worsen in the pandemic. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board is recruiting a dietetic lead for a new children's healthy weight management service. The service is not being launched directly because of the pandemic, but there are fears lockdowns and school closures could compound the problem. Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say 'Spend time on sport rather than weighing kids' Q&A: What is the latest Covid advice for children? Dr Naomi Simmons, consultant paediatrician at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, said: ""I do fear that the pandemic will contribute to an exacerbation of what's already a really, really significant problem. ""Whilst we're pleased that children are not suffering the acute effects of Covid in the same way as older patients are, on the whole, it's the long-term effects of the country being in this pandemic that we're worried about in terms of the long-term health of these children. ""It's that lack of routine, it's being out of school, and not being able to access their usual forms of physical activity."" Daniel, from Denbighshire - not his real name - is the father of a six-year-old girl who was referred to Dr Simmons's clinic when a GP became concerned about her weight two years ago. She is still under the care of the clinic. He said: ""We presumed we were feeding her correctly. She was getting fruit, veg, home-cooked meals. But I think our issue was, we kind of let her have treats, like chocolates and sweets. ""To be told the news [that she was obese], it was horrible. We were very upset. We were kind of angry about it - we didn't see a problem in her, we didn't believe she was overweight or obese. We were both asking what we had done wrong as parents - we gave her fruit, vegetables, home-cooked meals... we were asking ourselves, 'how have we failed as parents?'"" With support from Dr Simmons, his daughter made ""great progress"" and lost weight, he said. Previous signs of health issues such as liver problems had improved. Then the pandemic struck and the country went into its first lockdown,followed by the firebreak, thenthe current lockdown. Experts said they feared the impact of children not being able to take part in their usual physical activity Despite making efforts to keep active and eat healthily, Daniel has seen the gradual effects on his daughter, both physically and mentally. ""It had a bad effect on her, and not just the weight - mental health-wise it's also affected her. She's six years old and is worried about being around other people in the street,"" he said. ""In years to come, Covid will be gone, we'll have control of it. But obesity, that's the issue that's going to be prolonged. ""The long-term mental health impact really scares me - not just for my daughter, but for so many other children."" Dr Simmons said increasing rates of childhood obesity in recent years meant experts were treating more children with conditions normally associated with adults. ""Even children as young as primary school age, I'm seeing those children with fatty liver changes for example, as a result of their obesity. We're seeing them with high blood pressure and we're seeing children and young people developing type 2 diabetes and many more with pre-diabetic states because of their obesity."" Doctors said they were seeing primary school children with high blood pressure She revealed her youngest patient was only a year old and encouraged families to get their children ""used to being fit and healthy and consuming a healthy diet"". ""It's lack of exercise, it's the sedentary lifestyle that we as a nation are sadly embracing these days,"" she added. If children remain overweight and remain obese into adolescence, they have an 80% chance of being obese into adulthood, said Dr Simmons. She said she hoped the new service would give ""the very best chance of turning things around"". Steven Grayston, Betsi Cadwaladr health board's assistant area director of therapy services, said the health board had been working for the past five years to develop its obesity services. ""This is a specialist weight management service for children who are already obese,"" he said. ""We want to stop them becoming obese, therefore we want to develop preventative services as well as treatment services. ""We're very concerned about the impact of Covid and the pandemic on children's activity levels, certainly in terms of team-based sports and access to leisure facilities - particularly things like swimming, which we know children enjoy. ""We're concerned that children just aren't getting out of the house and doing things, and the impact that'll have and the knock-on effect on obesity levels in the future, as children are just less active and less interested in doing those activities."" The Welsh Government said: ""We will shortly be publishing a revised delivery plan for Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales for 2021-22, which will focus on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on children and families.""

"This video can not be played Richard Leonard: 'Leadership speculation was harming Labour' Richard Leonard has resigned as Scottish Labour leader, saying it is in the best interests of the party for him to stand down. Mr Leonard said he believed speculation about his leadership had become a ""distraction"". And he said he would be stepping down with immediate effect. His resignation comes just months ahead of the Scottish Parliament election, which is scheduled to be held  in May. Mr Leonard had been leader of the party for three years after succeeding Kezia Dugdale. The former union official had faced open calls to quit from some of his own MSPs last year amid concerns that his leadership style could damage the party in the forthcoming Scottish Parliament election. Profile: Who is Richard Leonard? Four Scottish Labour MSPs call for Leonard to quit Polls have suggested that many Scottish Labour supporters struggle to recognise him, and he is closely associated with former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Scottish Labour had dominated politics in Scotland for decades, but is currently the third largest party at Holyrood behind the SNP and Conservatives. And Mr Leonard's critics had questioned whether he was capable of turning the party's fortunes around. Mr Leonard was seen as a close ally of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn In a statement, Mr Leonard said the decision to resign had not been easy - but he felt it was the right one for him and his party. He said: ""I have thought long and hard over the Christmas period about what this crisis means, and the approach Scottish Labour takes to help tackle it. ""I have also considered what the speculation about my leadership does to our ability to get Labour's message across. This has become a distraction. ""I have come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of the party that I step aside as leader of Scottish Labour with immediate effect."" He also insisted that Scotland now needs a Labour government more than ever, and accused both the Scottish and UK governments of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Leonard added: ""While I step down from the leadership today, the work goes on - and I will play my constructive part as an MSP in winning support for Labour's vision of a better future in a democratic economy and a socialist society."" His decision leaves Scottish Labour looking for its fifth leader since the independence referendum in 2014 - with Johann Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale all having held the job since then. A Procedures Committee, to oversee the election of Mr Leonard's successor, has been formed and will have its first meeting on Friday. Meanwhile, Labour's Scottish Executive Committee will also meet in the coming days to agree a timetable for the process. MSP Jackie Baillie, who was Scottish Labour's deputy leader, has taken charge of the party on an interim basis. This sudden resignation four months from the Holyrood elections seems to have taken Scottish Labour by surprise. MSPs I've spoken to said they did not see it coming. There have been times when Richard Leonard has been under severe pressure from some in his party to stand down. When several MSPs publicly called for him to quit because the party had gone backwards at successive elections on his watch, he stood firm. His critics seemed to have accepted that he would lead them and a divided party into the Holyrood election. That has now changed and interim leader Jackie Baillie has to quickly organise a contest to replace him. It's a contest in which Anas Sarwar, if he stands, would be an obvious frontrunner - even although he lost last time to Mr Leonard, who was seen as much closer to the then UK party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Leonard should be ""very proud"" of his achievements as leader of the party in Scotland. Sir Keir added: ""I would like to thank Richard for his service to our party and his unwavering commitment to the values he believes in. ""Richard has led Scottish Labour through one of the most challenging and difficult periods in our country's history, including a general election and the pandemic."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Leonard had been due to face a confidence vote at the party's ruling Executive Committee last September - but the motion was withdrawn at the last minute. It came after four Scottish Labour MSPs called for him to go, warning that the party faced ""catastrophe"" at the ballot box under his leadership. They pointed to the party's dismal performance in previous elections under Mr Leonard. Scottish Labour finished fifth in the European election in May 2019, and then lost all but one of its MPs in the general election in December of the same year. Mr Leonard insisted at the time that he intended to lead the party into this year's Holyrood election, and accused his opponents of waging ""internal war"" against him. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who faced Mr Leonard in her weekly question session in the Scottish Parliament, tweeted that she had ""always liked Richard Leonard"" despite their political difference. She added: ""He is a decent guy and I wish him well for the future."" Ruth Davidson, who quit as leader of the Scottish Tories in 2019 before returning to lead the party at Holyrood, said she had always found Mr Leonard to be a ""thoroughly decent man and a committed campaigner."" Anas Sarwar, who was defeated by Mr Leonard in the leadership contest in 2017 and is seen as one of the favourites to replace him, said he was sure Mr Leonard would ""continue to fight for a fairer, more just and more equal society today, tomorrow and long into the future."" But Labour MSP Neil Findlay, an outspoken supporter of Mr Leonard, took aim at those who had sought to oust him last year - describing them as ""flinching cowards"" and ""sneering traitors"".

"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has denied reports that his department is planning to dilute UK workers' rights. It comes after the Financial Times said some protections brought in under EU law - such as the 48-hour limit on the working week - could be scrapped. New rules on rest breaks and changes to how holiday pay is calculated from overtime could be proposed, it added. But Mr Kwarteng insisted he wanted to ""protect and enhance workers' rights going forward, not row back on them"". In a social media post, he said that the UK ""has one of the best workers' rights records in the world - going further than the EU in many areas."" Allow Twitter content?

Labour said the newspaper report suggested the government was out of step with public feeling on workplace rules. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""These proposals are not about cutting red tape for businesses but ripping up vital rights for workers. They should not even be up for discussion."" The FT said,externalthe proposals were being drawn up with the approval of Downing Street, but that they hadn't yet been approved by ministers or cabinet. A government spokesperson said: ""We have absolutely no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights. ""The UK has one of the best workers' rights records in the world, and it is well known that the UK goes further than the EU in many areas. ""Leaving the EU allows us to continue to be a standard setter and protect and enhance UK workers' rights."" When the UK left the EU it retained many of its laws, but it is now able to change them. One aspect of EU employment regulation is the EU's Working Time Directive. It governs the hours employees in the EU can be asked to work. This must not exceed 48 hours on average, including any overtime. But employees can choose to opt out of the 48-hour week,external, if they often work overtime in roles in the emergency services, for example. In the 2019 Queen's Speech outlining the government's agenda for the coming parliamentary session, changes in employment law were promised. A new Employment Bill is expected to be published in 2021. One issue it is thought  it will address is over the distribution of tips. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady urged the prime minister to ""make good on his promises to his voters"" on Friday. ""The best way to do that is to bring forward the long-awaited Employment Bill, to make sure everyone is treated fairly at work,"" she said. What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights?

"The man demanded to know where the cats were kept, the court heard (File photo) A man accused of raiding a Melbourne animal shelter at gunpoint was trying to find his cat, a court has heard. Tony Wittman allegedly stormed the shelter on Monday in full camouflage gear and pointed an assault rifle at a female worker. Police say the victim and her colleagues are traumatised by the incident. Mr Wittman, 44, faces charges including kidnapping, false imprisonment, armed robbery and firearm offences. Police say he called the Lost Dogs' Home shelter on Monday but was told he would have to wait until the following morning to claim the lost cat. He allegedly went to the shelter later that day dressed in full camouflage and tied up a woman, demanding to know where the cats were kept. Australia to kill US pigeon that crossed Pacific Squirrels 'smuggled by plane to Australia' Mr Wittman allegedly told the woman: ""If you do as I say and listen to me, I won't shoot you."" Police say he told the female staffer to count to 100 before calling police. He then reportedly left the shelter and buried his clothes and weapons near his home. No animals were taken or harmed during the raid,according to local media,external. The court heard Mr Wittman returned to the shelter the next day to reclaim the animal. He was arrested later on Tuesday andadmitted to the raid, police say,external. He reportedly told police that the cat had on multiple occasions ""brought me back from the brink"". Detective Senior Constable Jo MacDonald told the court: ""On this occasion, he's acted to get back possession of a cat, which he was only going to be without for possibly 10 hours."" She said Mr Wittman had been in the army but was discharged for ""failing to render efficient service"". Mr Wittman's lawyer says he is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. He was denied bail and is set to appear in court in April. This video can not be played Do cats really do have nine lives? Well this cat rescued by a waste plant worker in Ulyanovsk, Russia does.

"This video can not be played Biden: 'I promise we will not forget you' President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus plan for the coronavirus-sapped US economy before he takes office next week. If passed by Congress, it would include $1tn for households, with direct payments of $1,400 to all Americans. The relief proposal includes $415bn to fight the virus and $440bn for small businesses. Mr Biden, a Democrat, has promised to beat the pandemic that has killed more than 385,000 people in the US. He campaigned last year vowing to do a better job handling the virus than outgoing President Donald Trump, a Republican. The direct payments of $1,400 would come on top of $600 payments provided in a relief bill enacted last month. Mr Biden's proposal comes as a winter surge of the coronavirus breaks records. Each day brings well over 200,000 new cases in the US and the daily death toll sometimes tops 4,000. US faces bleak winter amid worst Covid wave yet How much can Joe Biden get done on the US economy? In a primetime speech on Thursday night from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, he said: ""A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there's no time to waste."" ""The very health of our nation is at stake,"" he added. ""We have to act and we have to act now."" The incoming president said: ""There will be stumbles, but I will always be honest with you about both the progress we're making and what setbacks we meet."" Mr Biden wants to pump $20bn into vaccinating Americans, including setting up mass vaccination hubs and dispatching mobile units to remote areas. Two effective vaccines were delivered under the Trump administration, but health officials say the rollout needs to speed up. ""The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,"" said Mr Biden. His administration aims to deliver 100 million jabs in 100 days. So far,about 11 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US,external, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His plan also calls for $50bn to expand testing and $130bn to help most schools reopen by the spring. The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers for contact tracing. By BBC Reality Check US officials have acknowledged that the vaccination programme has not been working as smoothly as planned,external, and a goal to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of 2020 was not met. ""We know that it should be better, and we're working hard to make it better,"" said Moncef Slaoui, who leads the government's vaccine rollout plan, at the end of December. President Trump has deflected attention onto the states to deliver the jabs - telling them to ""get moving"" - but there has also been criticism of the level of government support given to local health authorities. And there have been issues around getting sufficient supplies to vaccinations centres, as well as co-ordination and preparedness at the state level. There are wide variations in vaccination rates: South Dakota has administered more than 6,000 doses per 100,000 people, and Alabama fewer than 2,000. When you look at vaccine doses per head in the countries doing the most vaccinations, the US is currently fourth. With nearly 11 million people unemployed across the country, supplemental jobless benefits would increase to $400 a week from $300 a week now. They would also be extended until September, along with a moratorium on evictions and home repossessions. The proposal would bring payouts for families to the $2,000 figure that both Mr Biden and Mr Trump called for. Lady Gaga to sing at Joe Biden's inauguration What Joe Biden wants to do The president-elect will also call on Congress to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour - a Democratic priority that predates the pandemic. Republicans are likely to object to piling up trillions more in debt that the US has already incurred to tackle the pandemic, and the incoming president acknowledged his plan ""does not come cheaply"". But he will be helped by his fellow Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress, if only by narrow margins. Trump faces Senate trial after historic charge The beginning of Mr Biden's term, however, will take place against the backdrop of a US Senate impeachment trial for his predecessor. It is unclear how quickly the Senate will proceed - or whether it will vote to convict President Trump - but the drama is expected to prove a distraction from the Biden agenda.
