"The Treasury is refusing to publish a forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget. Independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has already provided a draft to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC understands. The Treasury Select Committee says a forecast is ""vital"" given recent government moves to curb living costs. Action to cap annual energy billscould cost about Â£150bn, andtax cuts are expected on Friday. The mini-Budget is expected to see the government reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which reports say could cost Â£30bn. The draft forecast the OBR has provided does not include the impact of the energy bill help. It has offered to provide a forecast including this impact, but that has been rejected. The fact the offer has not been taken up is raising some concerns about whether the government's tax and spending policy is ""flying blind"", given predictions that the UK is facing a lengthy recession. MPs on the Treasury Select Committee wrote to the chancellor on Tuesday seeking assurance that an OBR forecast would be published. ""These forecasts are a vital indicator of the health of the nation's finances, and provide reassurance and confidence to international markets and investors,"" said the committee's chairman, Mel Stride. ""There has been a deterioration in our economic outlook since the last OBR forecast in March. There have been significant fiscal interventions since then and we are told there will be further significant interventions including major permanent tax cuts to be announced on Friday. ""Under these circumstances, it is vital that an independent OBR forecast is provided."" Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer? Tax-cutting mini Budget on Friday next week The OBR is obliged to produce economic forecasts twice a year, usually accompanying the Autumn Budget and Spring Statement. On Friday, there will be no independent assessment about whether permanent tax cuts and some one-off spending increases are consistent with the government's Budget rules. The lack of OBR forecast also means it will not cast judgement on the impact of the new tax measures on growth - a key target for the government which wants to increase the trend rate of growth to 2.5%. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""Given the exceptional circumstances our country faces, we have moved at immense speed to provide significant energy bill support for households and businesses, and are acting swiftly to set out further plans to kickstart economic growth later this week. ""We remain committed to maintaining the usual two forecasts in this fiscal year, as is required."" In its latest long-term forecast in July, the OBR said trend growth had fallen from 2.2% to 1.4%, partly because of a declining size of the workforce. In the City, where in recent weeks the value of the pound sterling has fallen and the cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen, there is some expectation that the Treasury will imminently have to formally increase its ""remit"" for borrowing. The Financing Remit is given to the Debt Management Office based on a forecast for borrowing. Extra sales of government loans, known as gilts, also need to be co-ordinated with the Bank of England, which is planning to sell off some of the gilts it owns, as it starts to reverse its long-running programme of stimulus. Government insiders say that the main motivation behind Friday's announcements is to enact the PM's leadership campaign promises as quickly as possible, and that a full forecast will accompany an upcoming Budget statement. The cost of the energy package, for example, could vary considerably depending on market prices for gas, and the ability of the government to renegotiate expensive contracts for renewable energy.

"Steel manufacturing requires a lot of energy Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package. The scheme will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs. Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said. It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years. Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to Â£150bn. Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter. It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category. Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at Â£211 per MWh for electricity and Â£75 per MWh for gas. Those rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers. Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. The government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible. Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November. Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from Â£44,000 to around Â£124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced. ""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things."" ""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see."" Read more reaction to the energy support for businesses,here. Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"". ""At present our cheapest room rate is Â£110 per night. We would have had to raise that to Â£415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April. ""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added. Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"". Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"". Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". ""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added. The support will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland. Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around Â£25bn. Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher. The government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to Â£2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme. On Wednesday, it also said: New laws would be introduced to ensure landlords passed the discount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills. An additional Â£100 payment would go to households that do not receive support for their heating costs, such as those not served by the gas grid. The big problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention. But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period. The government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed. Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package. ""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board."" However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"". Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%. A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.

"Hundreds of thousands of people filed past the Queen's coffin as she lay in state A man who tried to grab the flag draped over the Queen's coffin as she lay in state did not believe she was dead, a court has heard. The prosecution claims Muhammad Khan wanted to look in the coffin to ""check for himself"" the Queen was there. Mr Khan, 28, also allegedly planned to go to royal residences to ""try to make contact"" with the monarch. He was granted bail on condition he remains in a mental health hospital until his next court hearing. Doctors assessed Mr Khan as not fit to take part in proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he appeared charged with two offences under the Public Order Act. The court heard he was suffering from delusions and the judge told him: ""At the time when you were in Westminster you didn't accept that the Queen was dead and that was the reason you were moving towards the coffin to satisfy yourself that she was."" He added: ""He is delusional still and thinks the Queen is not dead, thinks King Charles has something to do with it and may go to Windsor Castle to pay his respects, but also because he still thinks she is alive."" Prosecution lawyer Luke Staton, told the court Mr Khan had reached Westminster Hall when he was seen by officers to approach the coffin. ""He stepped off the carpet in the direction of the catafalque, then grabbed hold of the Royal Standard flag draped over the coffin with both of his hands,"" Mr Staton said. The court heard Mr Khan was quickly detained, arrested and interviewed by police. ""The defendant did express the idea that the Queen is not dead and that he approached the coffin because he wanted to check for himself,"" said Mr Staton. ""He did say, prior to the state funeral, he was planning on going to the funeral. ""He planned to write to the Royal Family and if they did not reply he planned to go to Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace and Balmoral to try to speak to the Queen."" The court heard Mr Khan said if he was unsuccessful that he ""would have to trespass in order to try and make contact"", and when asked how many times he would try, replied: ""As long as I'm living."" Mr Khan was among about 250,000 people who filed through the hall between 17:00 Wednesday and early on Monday morning to pay their respects.

"Jamal Edwards gave Ed Sheeran his first big break 12 years ago Pop singer Ed Sheeran has paid tribute to Jamal Edwards, saying he owed his career to his late friend's support. The star was speaking at a memorial for Edwards, who founded the online music platform SBTV and was made an MBE for services to music in 2014. The entrepreneur died in February at the age of 31. ""I really don't think I would have been given the opportunities that I was given had it not been for Jamal putting his arm around me,"" Sheeran said. ""I was slogging on the acoustic singer-songwriter scene for a very long time, just blending in... And Jamal was this sort of tastemaker."" Cocaine sparked Jamal Edwards death, coroner says Tributes flood in for entrepreneur Jamal Edwards Edwards gave Sheeran his first break on in 2010, getting him to perform the future single You Need Me, I Don't Need You on his YouTube channel. That video was how the star's manager, Stuart Camp, and record label Atlantic first discovered him. ""A lot of people assume that [because] I write songs and I perform, I probably would"" have become famous anyway, Sheeran said. ""I actually don't agree with that... I was one of many. ""I really don't think I would have been allowed through certain doors if it hadn't been for Jamal,"" he continued, adding: ""He was just all about finding people and showing people new opportunities, at a time where the industry was mostly based in London."" This video can not be played Jessie Ware and Lewis Capaldi perform at Jamal Edwards' memorial concert Tuesday's memorial also served as the inaugural fundraising event for the Jamal Edwards Self-Belief Trust, which aims to help young people at risk of homelessness, and to provide entry points to the media industry for people who might not otherwise have the opportunity. ""His generosity is what we want to continue,"" his mother, the Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards, told BBC News. ""He was always about championing young people. That was his main aim."" Edwards had also devoted his free time to helping the homeless, she added. ""He would go to the homeless shelter and give food out and give talks to young people every single Christmas. I would cook Christmas dinner... and he wouldn't be back until 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night - and we'd have to wait until he came back. ""So we're just going to try and do our best to continue exactly what he's done,"" she added. ""Nobody can do what Jamal did, but I'm going to give it a good try."" Edwards founded SBTV ""on a Â£20 phone""  while he was still at school - but the channel went on to launch the careers of artists like Dave, Skepta, Ed Sheeran and Emeli SandÃ©. It was pivotal in documenting and promoting the rise of London's grime scene, which Edwards saw as ""like the punk movement, in terms of lyrics and rebellious attitude"". As his fortune grew, he expanded into other entrepreneurial ventures, often with a focus on improving the lives of disadvantaged young people; and shared his experiences in the best-selling book  Self Belief: How to Be a Success on Your Own Terms. He died suddenly in February from a heart attack after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol, a coroner concluded. Edwards' mother, Brenda, and Tracey Parry-Knight, CEO of the Jamal Edwards Trust, gave a heartfelt and emotional speech Tuesday's memorial, held in London's new Here at Outernet venue, also saw performances from Jessie Ware, Lewis Capaldi and Max Cyrus, with Hollywood star Terry Crews hosting the gala. The event featured a star-studded auction which had a host of ""money-can't-buy experiences"" including a meal-for-two with Luther star Idris Elba, and a David Beckham-signed Inter Miami t-shirt. Organisers said the event raised more than Â£100,000 on the night. Crews, who is best known for the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, said he had first met Edwards on a promotional trip to London in 2014. ""We did the media thing but afterwards, we started to talk. And I just was like, 'Man, I love what you're about. I love everything you're doing. How can I help you? ""So we exchanged numbers, and every time I came to London ever since, I sat down with Jamal and hung out with him. ""We had all these visions and all these plans... And man, when I found out that he passed, I couldn't believe it."" Crews said he wanted to be involved in the fundraiser to ""to continue the mission that Jamal started"", calling him a ""visionary"" who had changed hundreds of people's lives. Jessie Ware, who dedicated a cover of What You Won't Do For Love to Edwards, agreed that he had left a significant impact on Britain's music scene. ""He was the platform for so many artists that are leading the way in music,"" she said, remembering him as a ""generous, warm, funny"" friend, with whom she shared a dance at Sheeran's wedding. ""His legacy lives everywhere, which is such a special, important thing,"" she added. ""I'm sure he'll be somewhere watching this [event] and be really annoyed that he's not in the room, on the dance floor."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds of people filling streets A man sentenced for carrying a knife at a protest in Leicester at the weekend said he was influenced by social media. Adam Yusuf, 21, received a suspended jail sentence after admitting possessing a knife at a march on Sunday. The protest followed unrest on Saturday in which 25 officers and a police dog were injured. It came amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Leicestershire Police's temporary chief constable, Rob Nixon, told the BBC that social media had played a ""huge role"" in fanning the flames. ""There are significant things on there which are false,"" he said, citing assaults of people and attacks on religious establishments as examples. ""My plea is that please, if people are seeing information on social media, if they can't validate it, please don't circulate it. ""Because what we know people are doing is they are receiving fake news via social media and then they are forwarding it on, so it's amplifying the problem, and it's raising fear."" Rob Nixon said police had been outnumbered by groups of hundreds of people Yusuf, of Bruin Street in Leicester, is one of two people who have already been sentenced in relation to the disorder. Leicester Magistrates' Court heard Yusuf told the probation service he had been ""influenced by social media"" in relation to events taking place near where he lived and was ""upset"". He was sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for 18 months. Sentencing Yusuf, the magistrate told him: ""This behaviour will not be tolerated and brings shame on our city and community relationships."" Police say 47 people have now been arrested in relation to disorder in the city since 28 August. Of these, two people were arrested on Saturday and 18 were arrested on Sunday. Mr Nixon said arrests will continue ""for several weeks, if not months"". ""We have about a 50-strong investigation team that are wrapping across all of these different elements and I know that we're starting to identify imagery of people,"" he said. There was a further protest in Belgrave Road on Sunday afternoon On Monday, Amos Noronha, 20, of Illingworth Road, Leicester was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty to possession of an offensive weapon following his arrest on Saturday night. A third man, Lukman Patel, 31, of Homeway Road, Leicester, remains in custody after pleading not guilty to possession of an offensive weapon and racially aggravated harassment/alarm/distress. Police said ""proactive patrols"" continued in East Leicester overnight between Monday and Tuesday, and no new incidents had been reported. Mr Nixon saidofficers faced ""significant aggression""over the weekend and 25 were now known to have been injured, although none of the injuries were serious. He said the main disorder on Saturday had been sparked by a protest, and police had not known so many people would become involved. ""At one point we had got a group of probably 200 on one side and we ended up with a group of probably 600 or 700 on the other,"" he said. ""So you've got 800 or 900 people in a really close area, being protected by about 100 or so officers, and I think my officers did an amazing job in really difficult circumstances."" Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday, but police said the area was quiet overnight into Monday. Police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area during the unrest The arrests have included people from outside of the city, including some from Birmingham. ""I think there are people from outside of Leicester that are going onto social media and talking about 'let's get behind this, let's travel to Leicester',"" said Mr Nixon. ""So they are stoking up people from outside of Leicester to try and join a fight, which is probably being fuelled by the social media rhetoric."" Community leaders in the city have joined police in calling for calm. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: ""We often talk about the good community relations in Leicester, but you can never be complacent about it, you can never take it for granted. ""It is always a work in progress and it is quite clear there is work to be done here."" Reading a joint statement from the Hindu and Muslim communities, Pradip Gajjar said: ""The two faiths have lived harmoniously in this wonderful city for over half a century. ""We arrived in this city together, we faced the same challenges together, we fought off racist haters together, and collectively made this city a beacon of diversity and community cohesion. ""We together call upon the immediate cessation of provocation and violence both in thought and behaviour."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"Train drivers and railway workers are set to stage the largest strike to date as part of a long-running row over pay. Members of the Aslef and RMT unions will walk out on 1 October in order to bring the rail network to an ""effective standstill"", union bosses said. Just 10% of services are likely to run on Saturday, with travel to and from the London Marathon as well as the Tory Party conference potentially affected. Train drivers will then take a second day of industrial action on 5 October. Aslef, which is the union for train drivers, has confirmed that 9,000 drivers at 12 train companies across the country will walk out on both 1 and 5 October. Meanwhile the RMT, which represents rail workers including guards and signalling staff, said it has given notice to Network Rail, which maintains the country's railways, as well as to 14 train companies that its 40,000 members will strike on 1 October. How much are rail workers paid? The Rail Delivery Group, the industry body representing train operators, claimed that ""thousands"" of runners taking part in the London Marathon could have their journeys disrupted. The race is on 2 October which is not a strike day but services could be disrupted following industrial action because trains are not in the correct locations. Many participants may also travel ahead of the event. ""These strikes will once again hugely inconvenience the very passengers the industry needs to support its recovery from the ongoing impact of the pandemic,"" said the Rail Delivery Group. The Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, from 2 October to 5 October, is also expected to be hit by disruption and cancelled services. The latest strike action comes after a series of large-scale walk outs in recent months as unions seek pay increases in line with the rising cost of living. Rail bosses claim they want to give workers pay rises but they and the government insist changes are needed to ""modernise"" the railway, to end some working practices and to save money. The RMT said its decision to hold further strikes was due to ""no further offers from the rail industry to help come to a negotiated settlement"". Mick Lynch, the union's general secretary, said the large-scale action would send a ""clear message to the government and employers that working people will not accept continued attacks on pay and working conditions at a time when big business profits are at an all-time high"". ""We want a settlement to these disputes where our members and their families can get a square deal.  And we will not rest until we get a satisfactory outcome,"" he added Train drivers' union Aslef, gave notice of the latest strike to the train companies on Friday, but did not make a a public announcement at the time now ""as a mark of respect for the monarch"". A strike had been planned for 15 September, but was postponed following the announcement of the Queen's death The union said it had successfully negotiated pay deals with nine train companies this year, but remained in dispute with some firms which it claimed hadn't offered any deal and where drivers hadn't had a pay increase since 2019. ""We would much rather not be in this position. We don't want to go on strike - withdrawing your labour, although a fundamental human right, is always a last resort for this trade union - but the train companies have been determined to force our hand, said Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary. The BBC understands members of the TSSA union are also expected to strike on 1 October, but this has not been officially confirmed. In separate disputes, Arriva Rail London members, Hull Trains and bus workers at First Group Southwest will also take strike action on October 1st. It's likely that about 10% of usual Saturday services will be able to run on 1 October. For the first time in the ongoing wave of strike action, both Aslef and the RMT will strike on the same day, meaning the number of trains running could be half of previous RMT strikes. The rail industry will now be putting together their contingency plans, with more detail expected at the end of the week. What gives the RMT strikes such nation-wide impact is the involvement of Network Rail signallers, which means a fraction of usual trains can run even in areas where train companies are not directly involved in strike action. When Aslef's train drivers get involved, few or no trains at all can run on affected train operators' routes. If the strikes go ahead, these will also be the first train strikes since Anne-Marie Trevelyan replaced Grant Shapps as Transport Secretary. She has already invited the general secretaries of Aslef, RMT and TSSA for meetings. This signals a desire to be seen to take a less adversarial approach than her predecessor. However, it doesn't mean the substance of the government's position has changed. How will you be affected by the rail strikes? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"A tourism levy is part of a co-operation agreement between Plaid Cymru and the Welsh government Visitors booking stays in Wales could face a tourism tax, including those who already live in Wales, the Welsh government has said. A public consultation will consider if overnight visitors should pay a levy on top of their holiday costs. The document reveals, if introduced, the tax would be applied to campers as well as people from Wales holidaying within the nation. The Welsh government said the tax would support ""sustainable tourism"". Some in the tourism industry fear it would put off visitors already cutting back due to higher bills and a charge could hit businesses struggling with rising bills. Welsh Conservatives said the plan could put livelihoods at risk. The proposal - which will take years to become law - comes after some beauty spots saw large increases in visitors after coronavirus travel restrictions were lifted,with concerns some areas could be overwhelmed. Under the consultation, published on Tuesday, councils would choose whether to introduce the charge ""according to the needs of their communities"", but it does not say how much the charge could be. But one council leader has already said her authority was ""not minded"" to adopt such a tax ""at the moment"". And a campsite boss has said business could be lost if some authorities imposed a tax, while others did not. What is a tourist tax and how will it affect me? Island considers green visitor charge Human faeces on popular paths a 'danger to health' The consultation document, published by the Welsh government, reveals the tax would apply to any visitor, regardless of whether they live in Wales or have travelled from outside, and it would apply to any sort of accommodation, including caravans, motorhomes, holiday lets, and hotels. Officials say all overnight stays in Wales would be liable to the charge, including business visits, but it is anticipated some groups of people may be exempt. Potential exemptions being proposed include Roma and Gypsy Traveller primary residence sites, and for those needing emergency accommodation, such as homeless people and domestic abuse victims. This video can not be played A group maintaining the mountain warns of the pressures large numbers of visitors bring. BBC Wales has been told the legislation, part of an agreement between Labour ministers and Plaid Cymru, may not be introduced until 2024, but it could be later than that. Finance and Local Government Minister Rebecca Evans said the intention was to ""bring about a sense of shared responsibility between residents and visitors, to protect, and invest in, our local areas"". ""By asking visitors - whether they have travelled from within Wales or from further afield - to make a small contribution towards maintaining and enhancing the place they are visiting, we will encourage a more sustainable approach for tourism,"" she said. Plaid's Cefin Campbell said: ""While Wales may be the first place in the UK to introduce such a levy, we do not believe it will be the last - as we have seen recently, a visitor levy may soon be introduced in Edinburgh so Wales is not alone."" But Richard Workman, a director at Shell Island in Gwynedd, said there were ""a lot of questions that need to be answered"" as soon as possible. ""According to what we've read, each individual council will be able to implement their specific rate,"" he said. ""You could have Gwynedd council implementing it at one rate and a council down in south Wales saying 'we don't need to do it'. ""If we've got to charge extra on top, and another council isn't implementing it, we could lose our customers to a different area altogether."" Richard Workman, a director of Shell Island, fears customers could be lost to a different area Mr Workman said introducing the tax on top of the cost of living and high fuel prices for people travelling for trips meant it was ""the wrong time to do it"" and he feared people would avoid holidaying in Wales. ""Getting people across the border into north Wales is the hardest thing,"" he added. ""If there's another tax on top, they'll go to the east coast of England,"" he said. Vale of Glamorgan Council leader Lis Burnett, said her authority had ""no plans to introduce a tourism levy"". ""We understand that the proposal is to give discretion to councils as to whether they do and we are not minded to at the moment,"" she told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Shell Island campers (from left) Chloe Riley, Matthew Goff and David Langsdale BBC Wales spoke to three campers visiting Shell Island from Derbyshire. It is one of the UK's largest campsites, with 800 pitches. Chloe Riley said: ""In order to come back to Shell Island in Wales I would still pay the taxâ¦ but it would depend on how much that was going to be."" Ditch Wales' sheep and rugby brand - tourism boss Love Island star to stick with holiday homes plan Her partner, Matthew Goff, agreed he would be willing to pay a tax to return to ""magical"" Shell Island, but added: ""We're a nation of taxpayers. We pay tax on everything. So, why introduce a new tax, in order just to go on holiday? ""People save hard, and is it really the right time to introduce more taxes when everything else has just shot through the roof?"" he asked. Another, David Langsdale, said he had been camping in Wales for years, but the introduction of a tax ""might make me think about going somewhere else if I had toâ¦ I'm a firm believer that I pay taxes in Derby, and when I come on holiday I shouldn't have to pay tax for anywhere else."" ""It might make me think twice about coming to Wales generally,"" he added. Chris Frost of North Wales Tourism says the sector is still recovering from the pandemic Chris Frost, chairman of North Wales Tourism, said businesses understood why the Welsh government was looking at introducing the charge after the influx of visitors, but he said businesses were still struggling to recover post-pandemic. Mr Frost, who owns Manorhaus restaurant with rooms in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said many businesses were still paying back support after being closed or restricted during the pandemic, adding he was going to be paying over Â£900 a month for the next four years. ""With the surges in the supply chains and utilities and food costs, employment costs rising, the cost of doing business at the moment is just absolutely a massive challenge for the industry,"" he said. ""Now is not the time for a consultation on a proposed tourism levy."" Wander Woman travel podcast host Phoebe Smith told BBC Radio Wales introducing a tax for people using accommodation was a ""less than an ideal solution"". ""The people who tend to make the most damage are those who come in and don't give so much back: people on coach trips, people on day trips and people who come on camper vans who don't even use a camp site, they drive in and bring their own food in,"" she said. Paul Williams, manager of Llandudno Pier, says a tourism levy at this time would be 'ludicrous' Paul Williams, general manager of Llandudno Pier, said a potential tax was a ""very bad idea, especially for us being one of the major tourist attractions in north Wales"". ""We've just come out of Covid last year, the last thing we need is a tax on tourism,"" he said. ""It's one of the biggest sectors in north Wales. ""To put a tax on top of it just seems ludicrous, especially at this time."" Currently the Welsh tourism tax - which the Welsh government calls a visitor levy - has lots of unknowns attached to it. We do not know how many councils might be interested in the funding, nor what the economic situation will be like when the policy is implemented, because we don't know when it will become law. We are told it is years away before the Senedd passes the legislation, which means it is likely plans for a levy in Scotland will come to fruition first. There are questions too about how the money will be used. As things stand, councils would get the cash to spend how they see fit, although ministers would like it spent on things that improve the experience for visitors and contribute to the costs related to tourism. If councils are allowed to spend the money with no strings attached, that might be tricky to ensure. We have been told the Welsh government is open to restricting its use in some way, although we were also told that it's difficult to do. This video can not be played What do you think about a tourist tax? The Welsh government said there were more than 90m visits to Wales in 2019, resulting in a combined spend of more than Â£5.9bn. Of those, 10m were overnight stays, bringing in more than Â£2bn. The proposal is part of the Welsh government's cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru where local authorities would be able to introduce the levy and use the money raised to invest in their local area. Ministers agreed it was a ""hot topic,"" but claim levies are common in tourism destinations around the world. Rebecca Evans has previously said any levy would allow councils to ""manage and invest"" in local services, ranging from cleaning beaches to maintaining toilets and footpaths. Welsh Conservative shadow tourism minister Tom Giffard said: ""This policy will put livelihoods at risk as one in seven jobs - 200,000 rely on the tourism industry. What's more, there has been no guarantee that this tax would see any improvement to tourism offers in local communities, and the proceeds are instead likely to get sucked up into council coffers. ""The decision to press ahead with this policy is nothing short of arrogance from the Labour Party, a symptom of their perpetual rule here in Wales.""

"This video can not be played Watch moments from the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II A peak audience of around 28 million viewers watched the Queen's funeral in the UK on Monday, making it one of the country's biggest ever TV events. More than 50 UK channels broadcast the service, as the nation paused to pay a final farewell to Queen Elizabeth II. The overall audience peaked at 12:25 BST, as her coffin was carried through the streets from Westminster Abbey. Around 20 million people watched on BBC One at that time, while ITV's audience numbers peaked at 5.3 million. The BBC says 32.5m viewers watched at least three minutes of its coverage. The overnight figures from ratings body Barb do not include all viewers watching through streaming apps like BBC iPlayer and ITV Player, or those who saw it on big screens outdoors or in cinemas, churches or pubs. The world's media broadcast from outside Westminster Abbey An average of 26.2 million viewers watched the Westminster Abbey funeral service between 11:00 and 12:00 across all channels, with 18.5 million  of those watching on the BBC. In comparison, Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 had more than 32 million UK viewers. A similar number are thought to have watched England's World Cup victory in 1966, although that occurred before the modern TV ratings system began. Almost 27.7 million watched Boris Johnson's Prime Ministerial statement on 10 May 2020, when he set out a plan to ease the first Covid lockdown. And the London 2012 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies each attracted almost 24.5 million viewers. The TV ratings don't include those who watched the service in churches, cinemas and on outdoor big screens Monday's royal funeral was shown live across most BBC channels - with a signed version on BBC Two - and all ITV and Sky stations. Children's channels CBBC and CBeebies stuck with their usual programmes, while Channel 5 broadcast the Emoji Movie and Stuart Little - drawing both criticism and praise from parents online. Channel 4 chose to broadcast the Queen's coronation from 1953 and other royal documentaries. Most commercial channels did not air adverts on the day, meaning the increased viewing did not result in a financial benefit. Amol Rajan: No respite for BBC, despite praise for funeral coverage How the world watched the Queen's funeral TV hosts deny jumping queue to see Queen's coffin The BBC's coverage of the funeral and processions through London was anchored by Huw Edwards, with David Dimbleby taking over when the cortege reached Windsor for a later committal service. Dimbleby was following in the footsteps of his father Richard, who played a similar on-air role at the funeral of George VI in 1952 and the Queen's coronation the following year. The Queen's funeral was on the front pages of Tuesday's newspapers Kirsty Young was also on the BBC presenting team on Monday, while Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham led the coverage on ITV. Anna Botting and Dermot Murnaghan were on air for Sky, and Alastair Stewart led the GB News team. ""This was a reminder once again of what quality national broadcasters we have,""wrote the Times' TV critic Carol Midgeley,external. ""From Fergal Keane's gentle, poetic voiceover to Alastair Bruce's wealth of knowledge on Sky News, none of them messed up or misspoke despite the huge potential to do so during such a long, nerve-racking live event."" Many observers commended the commentators for knowing when to let the pictures and sounds of the occasion tell the story. ""The funeral of Queen Elizabeth II was at its most poignant, and its most beautiful, when the broadcasters said nothing at all,""wrote the Daily Telegraph's Anita Singh,external. The BBC said a total of 32.5 million people tuned in to Monday's events across its channels and live iPlayer feed for at least three minutes. Hundreds of millions more are likely to have watched the proceedings around the world, with Piers Morgan providing commentary on Fox News in the US and Christiane Amanpour among the line-up on CNN.

"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control.

Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds of people filling streets A man sentenced for carrying a knife at a protest in Leicester at the weekend said he was influenced by social media. Adam Yusuf, 21, received a suspended jail sentence after admitting possessing a knife at a march on Sunday. The protest followed unrest on Saturday in which 25 officers and a police dog were injured. It came amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Leicestershire Police's temporary chief constable, Rob Nixon, told the BBC that social media had played a ""huge role"" in fanning the flames. ""There are significant things on there which are false,"" he said, citing assaults of people and attacks on religious establishments as examples. ""My plea is that please, if people are seeing information on social media, if they can't validate it, please don't circulate it. ""Because what we know people are doing is they are receiving fake news via social media and then they are forwarding it on, so it's amplifying the problem, and it's raising fear."" Rob Nixon said police had been outnumbered by groups of hundreds of people Yusuf, of Bruin Street in Leicester, is one of two people who have already been sentenced in relation to the disorder. Leicester Magistrates' Court heard Yusuf told the probation service he had been ""influenced by social media"" in relation to events taking place near where he lived and was ""upset"". He was sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for 18 months. Sentencing Yusuf, the magistrate told him: ""This behaviour will not be tolerated and brings shame on our city and community relationships."" Police say 47 people have now been arrested in relation to disorder in the city since 28 August. Of these, two people were arrested on Saturday and 18 were arrested on Sunday. Mr Nixon said arrests will continue ""for several weeks, if not months"". ""We have about a 50-strong investigation team that are wrapping across all of these different elements and I know that we're starting to identify imagery of people,"" he said. There was a further protest in Belgrave Road on Sunday afternoon On Monday, Amos Noronha, 20, of Illingworth Road, Leicester was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty to possession of an offensive weapon following his arrest on Saturday night. A third man, Lukman Patel, 31, of Homeway Road, Leicester, remains in custody after pleading not guilty to possession of an offensive weapon and racially aggravated harassment/alarm/distress. Police said ""proactive patrols"" continued in East Leicester overnight between Monday and Tuesday, and no new incidents had been reported. Mr Nixon saidofficers faced ""significant aggression""over the weekend and 25 were now known to have been injured, although none of the injuries were serious. He said the main disorder on Saturday had been sparked by a protest, and police had not known so many people would become involved. ""At one point we had got a group of probably 200 on one side and we ended up with a group of probably 600 or 700 on the other,"" he said. ""So you've got 800 or 900 people in a really close area, being protected by about 100 or so officers, and I think my officers did an amazing job in really difficult circumstances."" Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday, but police said the area was quiet overnight into Monday. Police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area during the unrest The arrests have included people from outside of the city, including some from Birmingham. ""I think there are people from outside of Leicester that are going onto social media and talking about 'let's get behind this, let's travel to Leicester',"" said Mr Nixon. ""So they are stoking up people from outside of Leicester to try and join a fight, which is probably being fuelled by the social media rhetoric."" Community leaders in the city have joined police in calling for calm. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: ""We often talk about the good community relations in Leicester, but you can never be complacent about it, you can never take it for granted. ""It is always a work in progress and it is quite clear there is work to be done here."" Reading a joint statement from the Hindu and Muslim communities, Pradip Gajjar said: ""The two faiths have lived harmoniously in this wonderful city for over half a century. ""We arrived in this city together, we faced the same challenges together, we fought off racist haters together, and collectively made this city a beacon of diversity and community cohesion. ""We together call upon the immediate cessation of provocation and violence both in thought and behaviour."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine.

"This video can not be played Watch moments from the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II A peak audience of around 28 million viewers watched the Queen's funeral in the UK on Monday, making it one of the country's biggest ever TV events. More than 50 UK channels broadcast the service, as the nation paused to pay a final farewell to Queen Elizabeth II. The overall audience peaked at 12:25 BST, as her coffin was carried through the streets from Westminster Abbey. Around 20 million people watched on BBC One at that time, while ITV's audience numbers peaked at 5.3 million. The BBC says 32.5m viewers watched at least three minutes of its coverage. The overnight figures from ratings body Barb do not include all viewers watching through streaming apps like BBC iPlayer and ITV Player, or those who saw it on big screens outdoors or in cinemas, churches or pubs. The world's media broadcast from outside Westminster Abbey An average of 26.2 million viewers watched the Westminster Abbey funeral service between 11:00 and 12:00 across all channels, with 18.5 million  of those watching on the BBC. In comparison, Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 had more than 32 million UK viewers. A similar number are thought to have watched England's World Cup victory in 1966, although that occurred before the modern TV ratings system began. Almost 27.7 million watched Boris Johnson's Prime Ministerial statement on 10 May 2020, when he set out a plan to ease the first Covid lockdown. And the London 2012 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies each attracted almost 24.5 million viewers. The TV ratings don't include those who watched the service in churches, cinemas and on outdoor big screens Monday's royal funeral was shown live across most BBC channels - with a signed version on BBC Two - and all ITV and Sky stations. Children's channels CBBC and CBeebies stuck with their usual programmes, while Channel 5 broadcast the Emoji Movie and Stuart Little - drawing both criticism and praise from parents online. Channel 4 chose to broadcast the Queen's coronation from 1953 and other royal documentaries. Most commercial channels did not air adverts on the day, meaning the increased viewing did not result in a financial benefit. Amol Rajan: No respite for BBC, despite praise for funeral coverage How the world watched the Queen's funeral TV hosts deny jumping queue to see Queen's coffin The BBC's coverage of the funeral and processions through London was anchored by Huw Edwards, with David Dimbleby taking over when the cortege reached Windsor for a later committal service. Dimbleby was following in the footsteps of his father Richard, who played a similar on-air role at the funeral of George VI in 1952 and the Queen's coronation the following year. The Queen's funeral was on the front pages of Tuesday's newspapers Kirsty Young was also on the BBC presenting team on Monday, while Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham led the coverage on ITV. Anna Botting and Dermot Murnaghan were on air for Sky, and Alastair Stewart led the GB News team. ""This was a reminder once again of what quality national broadcasters we have,""wrote the Times' TV critic Carol Midgeley,external. ""From Fergal Keane's gentle, poetic voiceover to Alastair Bruce's wealth of knowledge on Sky News, none of them messed up or misspoke despite the huge potential to do so during such a long, nerve-racking live event."" Many observers commended the commentators for knowing when to let the pictures and sounds of the occasion tell the story. ""The funeral of Queen Elizabeth II was at its most poignant, and its most beautiful, when the broadcasters said nothing at all,""wrote the Daily Telegraph's Anita Singh,external. The BBC said a total of 32.5 million people tuned in to Monday's events across its channels and live iPlayer feed for at least three minutes. Hundreds of millions more are likely to have watched the proceedings around the world, with Piers Morgan providing commentary on Fox News in the US and Christiane Amanpour among the line-up on CNN.

"It was a day when people stood still - on the streets and in their homes - to witness Queen Elizabeth II's final journey. Royals and world leaders were inside Westminster Abbey. But outside there were many more, ordinary mourners lining the streets of central London. And further beyond - in living rooms and parks, in pubs, cinemas and town squares - the British public marked the first state funeral for nearly six decades in millions of individual ways. In Doncaster, Alistair Mitchell brought afternoon tea and sandwiches for his mother, who had not been able to make the journey to London. At the Curzon cinema in Sheffield, there were no pre-show trailers, or the sound of rustling popcorn - just an audience dressed mostly in black as they watched the ceremony. Blackpool's illuminations were switched off. At 06:32 BST, the final mourner filed past the Queen's coffin at Westminster Hall as her four-and-a-half-day lying-in-state drew to a close. The Queue had come to end. But overnight, Monday's crowd was already gathering. At Horse Guards Parade, it was 10-people deep before 08:30. By 09:10, viewing areas for the procession route were full. At The Mall, the Rowlassons - Kyre, 23, his mum Beveley, 41, and granddad Fred, 72 - had secured a front-row spot, after setting off from Birmingham the previous day. All three had spent the night on the ground in their sleeping bags. Had they slept? ""Not a wink,"" says Kyre. And then, at 10:44, the Queen's coffin began its short journey to Westminster Abbey. As she went to switch on her television, Liz Perry, 59, was struck by the silence outside her living room, in Derby. It was, Liz thought, as if a blanket had been draped over the entire street - clearly, all her neighbours were tuning in too. At St Anne's Church, in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, Sue Lalor had taken her seat in a pew. A screen above the altar was showing the service. Sue could have watched at home but that would have meant doing so alone. ""This was a moment I wanted to share with other people,"" she said. Not everyone in the country has been as caught up in the emotion of recent days but some 250 miles (400km) away in Harwich, Essex, landlord Nick May agreed with Sue. His first instinct had been to close his pub, The Alma, out of respect, but his staff persuaded him to stay open. ""This is a group moment of grief,"" Nick said. Gathered in the bar were about 35 people from around the coastal town. Several were veterans. Others, said Nick, had lost parents or grandparents and saw the Queen as a reminder of times past. 'The proudest day of my life' - your tributes to the Queen Nation pays final farewell to Queen Elizabeth II Photos that defined the day This was history - solemn, spectacular and intense Waiting for the service to begin, Andrew Smith stood in Birmingham's Centenary Square and felt goosebumps rising on his arm. He and his wife Margaret, from Barnwell, Northamptonshire, were in the city to celebrate their 51st wedding anniversary. Margaret's mind was on 1953, when she had been taken to watch the Queen's coronation at her nan's house and later to a street party. ""She's like our grandmother, she's always been there,"" Margaret said, visibly emotional. At 11:00, the funeral was under way. The Very Rev David Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, spoke of the Queen's ""unswerving commitment to a high calling over so many years as Queen and Head of the Commonwealth"". Meanwhile, in Manchester's Cathedral Gardens, rain was falling. Rebecca Watson, 38, thought of those who had filed through the streets of London over the weekend to witness the Queen's lying-in-state and resolved to stay where she was. ""If people have been in a queue for 14 hours I think we can cope with this,"" she said. As she watched in a park in Hastings, Jo Musson, 62, who had set off on holiday from her home in Worcestershire in her campervan before the Queen's death, worried that she had not packed any black clothes. Inside Westminster Abbey, the congregation began to sing The Lord Is My Shepherd. More than 300 miles away in Belfast, Simon Freedman, 51, from Coleraine, County Londonderry, thought of his mother, Olive. It had been her favourite hymn, but when she died of Covid in 2020 at the age of 79, the family had been unable to hold a service in which they could sing it. ""I knew when that hymn came on I'd shed a tear."" Ahead of the two minutes' silence, everyone in the Royal British Legion, in Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, stood, bowed their heads, and sang along to the national anthem. Afterwards, a lone bagpiper played a lament. For Emma Parsons-Reid, 55, watching at home in Ely, Cardiff, with family and neighbours, it was at this point that the Queen's death struck home. ""For the first time, it felt real,"" she said. On The Mall, many spectators had watched the service on their phones. As the Queen's coffin made its way towards them, spectators stood on tiptoes, with children lifted on to shoulders, as the crowd collectively craned its necks for a final glimpse. Then, as the procession passed, they fell silent. In Windsor, a committal service would be held at St George's Chapel - where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan, were married in 2018 and where the Queen's late husband Prince Philip's funeral was also held. Dianne Turner, 62, didn't intend to go to Windsor's Long Walk to watch the funeral procession. She had wanted to be in the crowds in central London when she had set off from Somerset but there were problems with the trains so she went to Windsor instead. As she watched the committal service on the screens at Windsor, she wept. ""I think I got so emotional because my mum loved the Queen and this would have meant a lot to her."" Dianne had never met the Queen, but - like so many others - felt as though she had. By the time the state hearse slowly passed Dianne, taking Queen Elizabeth II towards her final resting place, businesses had already begun to reopen. Life was returning to normality. But not entirely as before. People had paused and thought about what was gone.

"Train drivers and railway workers are set to stage the largest strike to date as part of a long-running row over pay. Members of the Aslef and RMT unions will walk out on 1 October in order to bring the rail network to an ""effective standstill"", union bosses said. Just 10% of services are likely to run on Saturday, with travel to and from the London Marathon as well as the Tory Party conference potentially affected. Train drivers will then take a second day of industrial action on 5 October. Aslef, which is the union for train drivers, has confirmed that 9,000 drivers at 12 train companies across the country will walk out on both 1 and 5 October. Meanwhile the RMT, which represents rail workers including guards and signalling staff, said it has given notice to Network Rail, which maintains the country's railways, as well as to 14 train companies that its 40,000 members will strike on 1 October. How much are rail workers paid? The Rail Delivery Group, the industry body representing train operators, claimed that ""thousands"" of runners taking part in the London Marathon could have their journeys disrupted. The race is on 2 October which is not a strike day but services could be disrupted following industrial action because trains are not in the correct locations. Many participants may also travel ahead of the event. ""These strikes will once again hugely inconvenience the very passengers the industry needs to support its recovery from the ongoing impact of the pandemic,"" said the Rail Delivery Group. The Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, from 2 October to 5 October, is also expected to be hit by disruption and cancelled services. The latest strike action comes after a series of large-scale walk outs in recent months as unions seek pay increases in line with the rising cost of living. Rail bosses claim they want to give workers pay rises but they and the government insist changes are needed to ""modernise"" the railway, to end some working practices and to save money. The RMT said its decision to hold further strikes was due to ""no further offers from the rail industry to help come to a negotiated settlement"". Mick Lynch, the union's general secretary, said the large-scale action would send a ""clear message to the government and employers that working people will not accept continued attacks on pay and working conditions at a time when big business profits are at an all-time high"". ""We want a settlement to these disputes where our members and their families can get a square deal.  And we will not rest until we get a satisfactory outcome,"" he added Train drivers' union Aslef, gave notice of the latest strike to the train companies on Friday, but did not make a a public announcement at the time now ""as a mark of respect for the monarch"". A strike had been planned for 15 September, but was postponed following the announcement of the Queen's death The union said it had successfully negotiated pay deals with nine train companies this year, but remained in dispute with some firms which it claimed hadn't offered any deal and where drivers hadn't had a pay increase since 2019. ""We would much rather not be in this position. We don't want to go on strike - withdrawing your labour, although a fundamental human right, is always a last resort for this trade union - but the train companies have been determined to force our hand, said Mick Whelan, Aslef's general secretary. The BBC understands members of the TSSA union are also expected to strike on 1 October, but this has not been officially confirmed. In separate disputes, Arriva Rail London members, Hull Trains and bus workers at First Group Southwest will also take strike action on October 1st. It's likely that about 10% of usual Saturday services will be able to run on 1 October. For the first time in the ongoing wave of strike action, both Aslef and the RMT will strike on the same day, meaning the number of trains running could be half of previous RMT strikes. The rail industry will now be putting together their contingency plans, with more detail expected at the end of the week. What gives the RMT strikes such nation-wide impact is the involvement of Network Rail signallers, which means a fraction of usual trains can run even in areas where train companies are not directly involved in strike action. When Aslef's train drivers get involved, few or no trains at all can run on affected train operators' routes. If the strikes go ahead, these will also be the first train strikes since Anne-Marie Trevelyan replaced Grant Shapps as Transport Secretary. She has already invited the general secretaries of Aslef, RMT and TSSA for meetings. This signals a desire to be seen to take a less adversarial approach than her predecessor. However, it doesn't mean the substance of the government's position has changed. How will you be affected by the rail strikes? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played Smiling Adnan Syed is cheered as his conviction is tossed A US judge has quashed a Baltimore man's murder conviction in a case that spawned hit true crime podcast Serial. Adnan Syed was 18 when he was sentenced to life in prison for the death of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, whose body was found buried in the woods in 1999. Prosecutors last week asked the court to throw out his conviction, saying a year-long case review had turned up two alternative suspects. Mr Syed will be released into home detention. The 41-year-old's shackles were taken off in court on Monday after he spent nearly 23 years behind bars. Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn said she was vacating his conviction ""in the interest of fairness and justice"", adding the state had failed to share evidence that could have helped his defence at trial. Adnan Syed and Serial: What you need to know The decision does not mean he is innocent. Judge Phinn has ordered a new trial. A jury found Mr Syed guilty in 2000 of premeditated murder, kidnapping, robbery and false imprisonment. Prosecutors argued he was a scorned lover who had strangled Ms Lee, his classmate at Woodlawn High School, and - with the help of a friend - hid her body in Baltimore's Leakin Park. They relied in part on mobile phone location data that has since been proven unreliable. Every appeal Mr Syed filed over the past two decades was denied, including his most recent attempt in 2019. It was the 2014 podcast Serial that focused worldwide attention on the case and cast doubt on Mr Syed's guilt. Episodes of the show have been downloaded more than 340 million times. The case has also spawned other works, including an HBO docuseries in 2019. The Baltimore State Attorney's Office, which studied the case over the past year alongside Mr Syed's latest defence attorney, said on Wednesday that he deserved a new trial. Prosecutors said they lacked ""confidence in the integrity of the conviction"" and had identified two new potential suspects who were known to police since the 1999 murder. Neither suspect has been named, but officials said both had documented records of violence towards women, including convictions that occurred after Mr Syed's trial. One suspect was cleared from the investigation into Ms Lee's death after failing a lie-detector test, a method no longer admissible in many US courts. ""Our prosecutors have been sworn to not only aggressively advocate on behalf of victims of crime but when the evidence exists to exonerate those that have been falsely accused and convicted,"" lead prosecutor Marilyn Mosby said outside the court. She was interrupted by loud cheers as Mr Syed exited the building through a scrum of cameras and supporters. Before the ruling, the victim's brother told the court through tears that he was ""not against the investigation"", but had been blind-sided by prosecutors. ""Every day when I think it's over... or it's ended, it always comes back. It's killing me,"" said Young Lee. ""This is not a podcast for me. This is real life - a never-ending nightmare for 20-plus years."" Steve Kelly, a victim's rights lawyer for the family, said the Lees had been ""shut out of the legal process"" and were ""deeply disappointed"" with the way they had been treated. ""All they wanted was information,"" said Mr Kelly. ""If the truth is that somebody else killed their daughter, they want to know that more than anyone."" Serial Productions, which produced the podcast, has just released a new episode - the 13th - about the latest in the legal saga. It reports that last year Mr Syed's legal team applied for a review of his sentence under a new Maryland law which applies to those given more than 20 years in prison for crimes committed when they were under 18 (Mr Syed was 17 at the time of the murder). As part of this sentence review, an official in Baltimore city's state attorney's office examined the case files - and found two handwritten notes relating to information phoned in about a potential alternative suspect, the podcast reports. It was these notes that were not shared with the defence team in violation of legal protocol, it says. Serial brought international attention to the murder of Hae Min Lee and was one of the first hit podcasts of the past decade's boom in audio content. It was followed by other shows which raised questions about existing murder convictions or drew attention to cold cases - attracting big audiences and also, possibly, having an impact on the course of justice. They include In the Dark, a US podcast focusing on the case of Curtis Flowers, a black Mississippi man tried six times for the same crime by the same white prosecutor.His conviction was subsequently quashed by the US Supreme Court over racial biasand he was released after 23 years in prison in 2019 The unsolved killing ofAlistair Wilson, a father-of-two who was shot on his doorstep in the seaside town of Nairnin the Scottish Highlands in 2004, was the focus of the BBC's podcast The Doorstep Murder, which came out in 2018. His death remains unsolved but Police Scotland's major investigations team said earlier this year they believe a planning dispute was the likely motive A popular crime podcast about anAustralian man who was found guilty of his wife's murder- 40 years after she went missing. Chris Dawson was charged with the murder of his wife Lynette in 2018 after the podcast, The Teacher's Pet, garnered global attention and prompted a renewed investigation. Mrs Dawson's body has never been found.

"Liz Truss is due to to meet with world leaders including Mr Biden, at the UN General Assembly Liz Truss has said a new trade deal with the United States is unlikely in the ""short to medium term"". The prime minister is in New York for the UN General Assembly, where she will meet US President Joe Biden. The UK government had previously promised a post-Brexit trade deal with the US by 2022. Labour said the lack of a trade deal with the US ""is costing billions in lost potential trade opportunities and holding back growth"". Speaking ahead of her flight to the US, Ms Truss said: ""There aren't currently any negotiations taking place with the US and I don't have an expectation that those are going to start in the short to medium term."" In May, theUK signed a Memorandum of Understandingwith the US state of Indiana. How many trade deals has the UK done? Tax cuts expected in mini-budget Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer? What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK? The US is Britain's biggest individual trading partner and accounts for Â£1 in every Â£6 of UK trade. A deal to make it easier for the two nations to trade with each other had been a much-coveted jewel for the government's post-Brexit crown. But those hopes were dashed in the early months of the Joe Biden's administration. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Trade Secretaries - first Liz Truss, then Anne-Marie Trevelyan - conceded the US had other priorities. President Biden made clear protecting US jobs came first. Resuming free trade discussions has not been on the agenda. Instead, US-UK meetings focused on co-operation around issues such as China and Ukraine. Why did Ms Truss choose to raise this explicitly today? Perhaps to get in first and imply that it is the UK's choice. But also to signal that any threat from the US to refrain from talks unless the UK backed down on an option to dissolve the Northern Ireland Protocol would be empty. For it is Brexit itself - a policy President Barack Obama, when Mr Biden was his deputy, previously said would leave the UK at the back of the queue for a deal - that's likely to have played a key role  in  America's refusal to return to the negotiating table. Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas Symonds said: ""The admission that there is no prospect of a trade deal with the USA is terrible news for the UK economy. ""There is no doubt that the blame for this mess lies at the door of the prime minister, who tarnished the UK's international reputation as foreign and international trade secretary. ""This is an embarrassment for Liz Truss."" Ms Truss said she will use her speech at the UN to try and rally support for Ukraine and ending international energy dependence on Russia. Ms Truss pledged that her government will match or exceed the Â£2.3bn support given to Ukraine's ""inspirational"" troops over the last seven months Since Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February, only the United States has sent more military aid to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In her speech, Ms Truss will point to the recent success of Ukraine's counter-offensives as examples of what the country can achieve with Western backing. ""Ukraine's victories in recent weeks have been inspirational,"" Ms Truss said. ""Time and time again these brave people have defied the doubters and showed what they can do when given the military, economic and political support they need."" Ms Truss's visit to the US is her first foreign trip as prime minister. Political activity and government business have been paused until after the Queen's funeral, which Ms Truss attended alongside other politicians, foreign dignitaries and members of the Royal Family. She is due to meet with world leaders, including Mr Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron. Ahead of her meeting with Mr Macron, Ms Truss said she wanted to have a constructive relationship with France and there were a number of issues they need to work together on. She had previously declined to say whether Mr Macronwas a ""friend or foe""during the Conservative leadership contest. Prepare for the roaring return of politics. Families, businesses, the country face grave threats: soaring prices, crippling fuel costs, the prospect of recession. But, with the funeral now over, the arguments resume - and the demands for action will be loud. The prime minister is already on her first foreign trip in the job. It will mean the returning political conversation will have a diplomatic air - in its opening few hours at least - rather than an immediately intense domestic scrappiness. But that will be back before you know it. Read more from our political editor Supporting Ukraine was a key policy plank of the previous UK government led by Ms Truss's predecessor, Boris Johnson. On a visit to Ukraine last month,Mr Johnson said the West must endure rising energy billsto help the country drive out Russia. MPs will return to Parliament onWednesday, when they can swear a new oath of alliance to King Charles III, if they wish. Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg is expected to set out government's energy support package for businesses, but this is yet to be confirmed. The package was part ofa plan to limit energy bill rises for businesses and all householdsfor two years, unveiled hours before the Queen's death was announced. This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years OnThursday, Health Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey is due to make an announcement about her plan for the NHS this winter. A mini-budget, described as a ""fiscal event"" to outline the government's economic plans, will then take place onFriday. In it, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is expected to deliver tax cuts promised by Ms Truss during her campaign to be Conservative Party leader. Ms Truss has promised to use the mini Budget to undo a rise in National Insurance and cancel a planned hike in corporation tax. She has also said she would temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills to bring down prices for consumers.

"This video can not be played Liz Truss: ""I will always work to make sure we are helping those who are struggling."" Prime Minister Liz Truss has said she is prepared to take ""difficult decisions"" such as removing a cap on bankers' bonuses to boost the economy. In an interview with the BBC, Ms Truss said that spurring economic growth may mean doing unpopular things. Her government is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Speaking in New York ahead of a meeting with President Joe Biden, the PM said she was about ""delivering for people"". BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asked Ms Truss whether she was happy to see bankers getting bigger bonuses and for the rich to get richer. ""What I want to see is a growing economy,"" Ms Truss said. ""If that means taking difficult decisions which are going to help Britain become more competitive, help Britain become more attractive, help more investment flow into our country, yes, I'm absolutely prepared to make those decisions."" Tax cuts expected in mini-budget Treasury refuses to publish UK economic forecast Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Funeral honours Queen's 'lifelong sense of duty' Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said there was nothing difficult about lifting the cap on bankers' bonuses. ""This is a bizarre move that will do nothing to support growth, and comes straight from the tired Tory playbook on trickle-down economics which haven't worked for them over the last decade,"" the Labour MP said. President Biden tweeted earlier that he was ""sick and tired"" of the theory that cutting taxes for business and the wealthy would see the benefits ""trickle down"" into the pockets of poorer workers. Although apparently not intended as a swipe at Ms Truss, the comment underlines the political differences between the two leaders ahead of their meeting. The prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""ludicrous"" to suggest President Biden was referring to Ms Truss in the tweet. He said the world's democracies were ""not prescriptive"" in how they achieve economic growth. Ms Truss hasadmitted a new trade deal with the United Statesis unlikely in the ""short-to-medium term"" and that no discussions are currently underway. The UK government had previously promised a post-Brexit trade deal with the US by 2022. There has been lots of talk of a new era in the last few weeks, for obvious reasons. Now, with political argument returning, it is language the prime minister is embracing, about her premiership and the challenges she - we - face. 'We are entering a new era. It is a more insecure era,' she told me. Insecure abroad, insecure at home. The core of her political strategy is turbo-charging economic growth â and, for now at least, being willing to embrace the unpopular. ""Difficult decisions"" as she put it - such as allowing bankers to get bigger bonuses. There are two big questions for her: will it work, and will people like it? She doesn't have long to find out the answers, with a general election two-ish years away. In her Chris Mason interview, Ms Truss said she wanted to forge closer ties with the UK's allies. ""It is a more insecure era. We face an increasingly aggressive Russia, an assertive China. We need to work more closely with our allies, and we also need to get the British economy growing so that we have that security for all of our citizens."" In a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in New York, Ms Truss agreed to enhance UK-France co-operation on energy to cut costs for households. In Downing Street's account of the meeting, there was no mention of contentious issues that have strained Anglo-French relations since the UK left the European Union. Neither the unauthorised migrant crossings of the English Channel, nor the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland were discussed, in a meeting described as ""constructive"" by Downing Street. Mr Macron and Ms Truss were meeting face-to-face for the first time, weeks after the she questioned whether the French President was a friend or foe. ""I now believe in proof, in results,"" Mr Macron said. ""There is a will to re-engage, to move on and to show that we are allies and friends in a complex world."" Speaking earlier, Ms Truss said ""we are facing incredibly tough economic times"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic ""pushed up energy prices"". She said higher energy bills were ""a price worth paying"" for the UK's long-term security. Typical household energy bills will rise to Â£2,500 a year from 1 October, in part due toreductions in Russian gas exportsduring the war in Ukraine. Under Ms Truss's plans, energy bills will be frozen at that level for the next two years. The scheme is likely to be paid for by increased government borrowing, but the full details will be announced on Friday as part of a mini-Budget. On Wednesday, Ms Truss will use her speech to the United Nations General Assembly to rally support for Ukraine and highlight the threat from authoritarian states such as Russia and China. The PM will argue that democratic nations should prioritise economic growth and security to win the new era of strategic competition. Ms Truss will also reiterate her commitment to protecting the UK and its allies, including by increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030. ""Just as we are building a plan for growth at home, we are also developing a new blueprint for our engagement with the world,"" the PM is expected to say. ""We will build resilience and collective security - because they are vital for freedom and democracy.""

"File photo of a mourner placing a flower bouquet outside the British Consulate General A Hong Kong man who went to the British consulate on Monday night to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, among scores of mourners, has been detained. Local reports say the man, 43, played several songs on his harmonica, including one linked to 2019 protests, as well as the British national anthem. He was detained under the colonial-era sedition law, police told BBC Chinese. This law had until recently been rarely used by prosecutors. But the past few months have seen an increasing number of people charged under this law, including five speech therapists who were found guilty earlier this month of publishing ""seditious"" children's books. Footage shared widely on social media shows the man standing outside the consulate playing ""Glory to Hong Kong"", the unofficial anthem of protesters during 2019 pro-democracy protests, on his harmonica. A large crowd, which had gathered to watch an online live broadcast of the later Queen's state funeral in the UK, is seen singing along to the tune. The song's lyrics make reference to the ""tears on our land"", and also mention ""democracy and liberty"". Police told the BBC the man had been detained on suspicion of carrying out an ""act with seditious intent"". Hong Kongers have over the past week been lining up for hours to pay their respects to the Queen, in what has been perhaps the biggest display of affection for the late monarch seen outside the UK. Hong Kong's grief for the Queen sends message to Beijing Hong Kong's handover explained The city, formerly a British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Under the terms of the handover, China agreed to govern Hong Kong under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", where the city would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for the next 50 years. But a crackdown on protests, Beijing's imposition of its national security law and only allowing ""patriots"" to govern are seen by many as reneging on that promise.

"A tourism levy is part of a co-operation agreement between Plaid Cymru and the Welsh government Visitors booking stays in Wales could face a tourism tax, including those who already live in Wales, the Welsh government has said. A public consultation will consider if overnight visitors should pay a levy on top of their holiday costs. The document reveals, if introduced, the tax would be applied to campers as well as people from Wales holidaying within the nation. The Welsh government said the tax would support ""sustainable tourism"". Some in the tourism industry fear it would put off visitors already cutting back due to higher bills and a charge could hit businesses struggling with rising bills. Welsh Conservatives said the plan could put livelihoods at risk. The proposal - which will take years to become law - comes after some beauty spots saw large increases in visitors after coronavirus travel restrictions were lifted,with concerns some areas could be overwhelmed. Under the consultation, published on Tuesday, councils would choose whether to introduce the charge ""according to the needs of their communities"", but it does not say how much the charge could be. But one council leader has already said her authority was ""not minded"" to adopt such a tax ""at the moment"". And a campsite boss has said business could be lost if some authorities imposed a tax, while others did not. What is a tourist tax and how will it affect me? Island considers green visitor charge Human faeces on popular paths a 'danger to health' The consultation document, published by the Welsh government, reveals the tax would apply to any visitor, regardless of whether they live in Wales or have travelled from outside, and it would apply to any sort of accommodation, including caravans, motorhomes, holiday lets, and hotels. Officials say all overnight stays in Wales would be liable to the charge, including business visits, but it is anticipated some groups of people may be exempt. Potential exemptions being proposed include Roma and Gypsy Traveller primary residence sites, and for those needing emergency accommodation, such as homeless people and domestic abuse victims. This video can not be played A group maintaining the mountain warns of the pressures large numbers of visitors bring. BBC Wales has been told the legislation, part of an agreement between Labour ministers and Plaid Cymru, may not be introduced until 2024, but it could be later than that. Finance and Local Government Minister Rebecca Evans said the intention was to ""bring about a sense of shared responsibility between residents and visitors, to protect, and invest in, our local areas"". ""By asking visitors - whether they have travelled from within Wales or from further afield - to make a small contribution towards maintaining and enhancing the place they are visiting, we will encourage a more sustainable approach for tourism,"" she said. Plaid's Cefin Campbell said: ""While Wales may be the first place in the UK to introduce such a levy, we do not believe it will be the last - as we have seen recently, a visitor levy may soon be introduced in Edinburgh so Wales is not alone."" But Richard Workman, a director at Shell Island in Gwynedd, said there were ""a lot of questions that need to be answered"" as soon as possible. ""According to what we've read, each individual council will be able to implement their specific rate,"" he said. ""You could have Gwynedd council implementing it at one rate and a council down in south Wales saying 'we don't need to do it'. ""If we've got to charge extra on top, and another council isn't implementing it, we could lose our customers to a different area altogether."" Richard Workman, a director of Shell Island, fears customers could be lost to a different area Mr Workman said introducing the tax on top of the cost of living and high fuel prices for people travelling for trips meant it was ""the wrong time to do it"" and he feared people would avoid holidaying in Wales. ""Getting people across the border into north Wales is the hardest thing,"" he added. ""If there's another tax on top, they'll go to the east coast of England,"" he said. Vale of Glamorgan Council leader Lis Burnett, said her authority had ""no plans to introduce a tourism levy"". ""We understand that the proposal is to give discretion to councils as to whether they do and we are not minded to at the moment,"" she told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Shell Island campers (from left) Chloe Riley, Matthew Goff and David Langsdale BBC Wales spoke to three campers visiting Shell Island from Derbyshire. It is one of the UK's largest campsites, with 800 pitches. Chloe Riley said: ""In order to come back to Shell Island in Wales I would still pay the taxâ¦ but it would depend on how much that was going to be."" Ditch Wales' sheep and rugby brand - tourism boss Love Island star to stick with holiday homes plan Her partner, Matthew Goff, agreed he would be willing to pay a tax to return to ""magical"" Shell Island, but added: ""We're a nation of taxpayers. We pay tax on everything. So, why introduce a new tax, in order just to go on holiday? ""People save hard, and is it really the right time to introduce more taxes when everything else has just shot through the roof?"" he asked. Another, David Langsdale, said he had been camping in Wales for years, but the introduction of a tax ""might make me think about going somewhere else if I had toâ¦ I'm a firm believer that I pay taxes in Derby, and when I come on holiday I shouldn't have to pay tax for anywhere else."" ""It might make me think twice about coming to Wales generally,"" he added. Chris Frost of North Wales Tourism says the sector is still recovering from the pandemic Chris Frost, chairman of North Wales Tourism, said businesses understood why the Welsh government was looking at introducing the charge after the influx of visitors, but he said businesses were still struggling to recover post-pandemic. Mr Frost, who owns Manorhaus restaurant with rooms in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said many businesses were still paying back support after being closed or restricted during the pandemic, adding he was going to be paying over Â£900 a month for the next four years. ""With the surges in the supply chains and utilities and food costs, employment costs rising, the cost of doing business at the moment is just absolutely a massive challenge for the industry,"" he said. ""Now is not the time for a consultation on a proposed tourism levy."" Wander Woman travel podcast host Phoebe Smith told BBC Radio Wales introducing a tax for people using accommodation was a ""less than an ideal solution"". ""The people who tend to make the most damage are those who come in and don't give so much back: people on coach trips, people on day trips and people who come on camper vans who don't even use a camp site, they drive in and bring their own food in,"" she said. Paul Williams, manager of Llandudno Pier, says a tourism levy at this time would be 'ludicrous' Paul Williams, general manager of Llandudno Pier, said a potential tax was a ""very bad idea, especially for us being one of the major tourist attractions in north Wales"". ""We've just come out of Covid last year, the last thing we need is a tax on tourism,"" he said. ""It's one of the biggest sectors in north Wales. ""To put a tax on top of it just seems ludicrous, especially at this time."" Currently the Welsh tourism tax - which the Welsh government calls a visitor levy - has lots of unknowns attached to it. We do not know how many councils might be interested in the funding, nor what the economic situation will be like when the policy is implemented, because we don't know when it will become law. We are told it is years away before the Senedd passes the legislation, which means it is likely plans for a levy in Scotland will come to fruition first. There are questions too about how the money will be used. As things stand, councils would get the cash to spend how they see fit, although ministers would like it spent on things that improve the experience for visitors and contribute to the costs related to tourism. If councils are allowed to spend the money with no strings attached, that might be tricky to ensure. We have been told the Welsh government is open to restricting its use in some way, although we were also told that it's difficult to do. This video can not be played What do you think about a tourist tax? The Welsh government said there were more than 90m visits to Wales in 2019, resulting in a combined spend of more than Â£5.9bn. Of those, 10m were overnight stays, bringing in more than Â£2bn. The proposal is part of the Welsh government's cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru where local authorities would be able to introduce the levy and use the money raised to invest in their local area. Ministers agreed it was a ""hot topic,"" but claim levies are common in tourism destinations around the world. Rebecca Evans has previously said any levy would allow councils to ""manage and invest"" in local services, ranging from cleaning beaches to maintaining toilets and footpaths. Welsh Conservative shadow tourism minister Tom Giffard said: ""This policy will put livelihoods at risk as one in seven jobs - 200,000 rely on the tourism industry. What's more, there has been no guarantee that this tax would see any improvement to tourism offers in local communities, and the proceeds are instead likely to get sucked up into council coffers. ""The decision to press ahead with this policy is nothing short of arrogance from the Labour Party, a symptom of their perpetual rule here in Wales.""

"Justin Trudeau's office has defended the Canadian PM, after he was filmed singing by a piano in a London hotel, two days before the Queen's funeral. In a video shared on social media, the prime minister can be seen singing Bohemian Rhapsody by the British rock band, Queen. The Queen was Canada's head of state, and Mr Trudeau designated 19 September a national day of mourning in Canada. Critics accused the PM of a lack of respect - but others defended him. The video has been shared on social media, but while a spokesperson for the prime minister confirmed it was genuine, it is not clear who filmed it. It was taken at the Corinthia, where the Canadian delegation was staying, on the evening of Saturday 17 September. Mr Trudeau can be seen in a T-shirt, leaning on a piano as Gregory Charles, a musician from Quebec and recipient of the Order of Canada, plays Bohemian Rhapsody. Allow Twitter content?

"Mike Ashley is to step down from the board of Frasers Group, owner of the Sports Direct chain that the retail billionaire founded 40 years ago. Mr Ashley had already handed over the running of the group to his son-in-law Michael Murray earlier this year. Frasers said Mr Ashley would not be standing for re-election as a director, and would leave the board next month. The company also announced that Mr Ashley will provide the company with Â£100m worth of funding. In a statement, the firm also said Mr Ashley would continue to be available to the board and management for advice ""when called upon"". Mr Murray, Frasers' chief executive, said Mr Ashley had ""built an incredible business over the past 40 years"". Mr Ashley has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business. He first entered the fitness industry as a squash coach before opening his first High Street sports shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in 1982. The Sports Direct business grew as Mr Ashley bought up well-known names such as Dunlop, Slazenger and hat-maker Kangol. It is now the UK's largest sportswear retailer, with more than 400 stores. In 2007, Mr Ashley floated the business as a public company on the London Stock Exchange in a move which valued it at Â£2.5bn. Later that year, his public profile increased when he bought majority control of Newcastle United. However, his tenure was criticised by fans over his ownership style and perceived lack of investment, and he sold his stake in the club in October last year. As well as buying brands, the Sports Direct group also bought chains such as lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and luxury fashion chain Flannels. Mike Ashley may be stepping down from the board of Frasers Group but he is by no means out of the picture though. He is still the group's controlling shareholder with a stake of nearly 70% and has agreed to lend the business Â£100m. Starting out as a single sportswear shop, his retail empire now includes the likes of Game, Jack Wills, and Evans Cycles. The move does, however, mark a significant change of the guard and one which may bring major change to the business, of which Mr Ashley built the foundations for 40 years ago. Read more here In 2018, Mr Ashley bought the House of Fraser department store chain for Â£90m and the following year he changed his company's name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group. As his retail empire grew, Mr Ashley frequently courted controversy. His dealings with the City started badly when shares in Sports Direct halved shortly after the company's flotation. Many investors were unhappy at the way the company was run, but in a Sunday Times interview Mr Ashley called them ""cry babies"", telling the paper: ""Sports Direct should come with a government health warning - this stock is not for the fainthearted."" In 2017, London's High Court heard that the businessman once hosted a management meeting in a pubwhere he drank 12 pints and vomited into a fireplace. The company was also accused of building its success by exploiting workers.  In 2016, in a hearing before MPs, Mr Ashleyadmitted workers at its Derbyshire warehouse had been paid below the minimum wageand that its policy of fining staff for being late was unacceptable. Mr Ashley stepped away from running Frasers Group when he handed over the role of chief executive to Mr Murray in May this year. Michael Murray, Mike Ashley's son-in-law, took over as chief executive of Frasers Group Shortly after taking over the role, Mr Murray became Mr Ashley's son-in-law after marrying his daughter, Anna, in a lavish ceremony at Blenheim Palace. In an interview with the BBC in May, Mr Murray said that Mr Ashley was ""not pulling the strings"". ""We have vocal debates. We agree, we disagree. But ultimately the decision lies with me on the outcome of where we take the company."" Mr Murray is in line for a Â£100m pay-out if he can double Frasers' share price to Â£15 within the next three years. In order to get the payment, the company's share price needs to reach Â£15 for 30 trading days in a row before October 2025. The shares are currently trading at about Â£7.70.

"This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds of people filling streets A man sentenced for carrying a knife at a protest in Leicester at the weekend said he was influenced by social media. Adam Yusuf, 21, received a suspended jail sentence after admitting possessing a knife at a march on Sunday. The protest followed unrest on Saturday in which 25 officers and a police dog were injured. It came amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Leicestershire Police's temporary chief constable, Rob Nixon, told the BBC that social media had played a ""huge role"" in fanning the flames. ""There are significant things on there which are false,"" he said, citing assaults of people and attacks on religious establishments as examples. ""My plea is that please, if people are seeing information on social media, if they can't validate it, please don't circulate it. ""Because what we know people are doing is they are receiving fake news via social media and then they are forwarding it on, so it's amplifying the problem, and it's raising fear."" Rob Nixon said police had been outnumbered by groups of hundreds of people Yusuf, of Bruin Street in Leicester, is one of two people who have already been sentenced in relation to the disorder. Leicester Magistrates' Court heard Yusuf told the probation service he had been ""influenced by social media"" in relation to events taking place near where he lived and was ""upset"". He was sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for 18 months. Sentencing Yusuf, the magistrate told him: ""This behaviour will not be tolerated and brings shame on our city and community relationships."" Police say 47 people have now been arrested in relation to disorder in the city since 28 August. Of these, two people were arrested on Saturday and 18 were arrested on Sunday. Mr Nixon said arrests will continue ""for several weeks, if not months"". ""We have about a 50-strong investigation team that are wrapping across all of these different elements and I know that we're starting to identify imagery of people,"" he said. There was a further protest in Belgrave Road on Sunday afternoon On Monday, Amos Noronha, 20, of Illingworth Road, Leicester was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty to possession of an offensive weapon following his arrest on Saturday night. A third man, Lukman Patel, 31, of Homeway Road, Leicester, remains in custody after pleading not guilty to possession of an offensive weapon and racially aggravated harassment/alarm/distress. Police said ""proactive patrols"" continued in East Leicester overnight between Monday and Tuesday, and no new incidents had been reported. Mr Nixon saidofficers faced ""significant aggression""over the weekend and 25 were now known to have been injured, although none of the injuries were serious. He said the main disorder on Saturday had been sparked by a protest, and police had not known so many people would become involved. ""At one point we had got a group of probably 200 on one side and we ended up with a group of probably 600 or 700 on the other,"" he said. ""So you've got 800 or 900 people in a really close area, being protected by about 100 or so officers, and I think my officers did an amazing job in really difficult circumstances."" Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday, but police said the area was quiet overnight into Monday. Police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area during the unrest The arrests have included people from outside of the city, including some from Birmingham. ""I think there are people from outside of Leicester that are going onto social media and talking about 'let's get behind this, let's travel to Leicester',"" said Mr Nixon. ""So they are stoking up people from outside of Leicester to try and join a fight, which is probably being fuelled by the social media rhetoric."" Community leaders in the city have joined police in calling for calm. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: ""We often talk about the good community relations in Leicester, but you can never be complacent about it, you can never take it for granted. ""It is always a work in progress and it is quite clear there is work to be done here."" Reading a joint statement from the Hindu and Muslim communities, Pradip Gajjar said: ""The two faiths have lived harmoniously in this wonderful city for over half a century. ""We arrived in this city together, we faced the same challenges together, we fought off racist haters together, and collectively made this city a beacon of diversity and community cohesion. ""We together call upon the immediate cessation of provocation and violence both in thought and behaviour."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"A tourism levy is part of a co-operation agreement between Plaid Cymru and the Welsh government Visitors booking stays in Wales could face a tourism tax, including those who already live in Wales, the Welsh government has said. A public consultation will consider if overnight visitors should pay a levy on top of their holiday costs. The document reveals, if introduced, the tax would be applied to campers as well as people from Wales holidaying within the nation. The Welsh government said the tax would support ""sustainable tourism"". Some in the tourism industry fear it would put off visitors already cutting back due to higher bills and a charge could hit businesses struggling with rising bills. Welsh Conservatives said the plan could put livelihoods at risk. The proposal - which will take years to become law - comes after some beauty spots saw large increases in visitors after coronavirus travel restrictions were lifted,with concerns some areas could be overwhelmed. Under the consultation, published on Tuesday, councils would choose whether to introduce the charge ""according to the needs of their communities"", but it does not say how much the charge could be. But one council leader has already said her authority was ""not minded"" to adopt such a tax ""at the moment"". And a campsite boss has said business could be lost if some authorities imposed a tax, while others did not. What is a tourist tax and how will it affect me? Island considers green visitor charge Human faeces on popular paths a 'danger to health' The consultation document, published by the Welsh government, reveals the tax would apply to any visitor, regardless of whether they live in Wales or have travelled from outside, and it would apply to any sort of accommodation, including caravans, motorhomes, holiday lets, and hotels. Officials say all overnight stays in Wales would be liable to the charge, including business visits, but it is anticipated some groups of people may be exempt. Potential exemptions being proposed include Roma and Gypsy Traveller primary residence sites, and for those needing emergency accommodation, such as homeless people and domestic abuse victims. This video can not be played A group maintaining the mountain warns of the pressures large numbers of visitors bring. BBC Wales has been told the legislation, part of an agreement between Labour ministers and Plaid Cymru, may not be introduced until 2024, but it could be later than that. Finance and Local Government Minister Rebecca Evans said the intention was to ""bring about a sense of shared responsibility between residents and visitors, to protect, and invest in, our local areas"". ""By asking visitors - whether they have travelled from within Wales or from further afield - to make a small contribution towards maintaining and enhancing the place they are visiting, we will encourage a more sustainable approach for tourism,"" she said. Plaid's Cefin Campbell said: ""While Wales may be the first place in the UK to introduce such a levy, we do not believe it will be the last - as we have seen recently, a visitor levy may soon be introduced in Edinburgh so Wales is not alone."" But Richard Workman, a director at Shell Island in Gwynedd, said there were ""a lot of questions that need to be answered"" as soon as possible. ""According to what we've read, each individual council will be able to implement their specific rate,"" he said. ""You could have Gwynedd council implementing it at one rate and a council down in south Wales saying 'we don't need to do it'. ""If we've got to charge extra on top, and another council isn't implementing it, we could lose our customers to a different area altogether."" Richard Workman, a director of Shell Island, fears customers could be lost to a different area Mr Workman said introducing the tax on top of the cost of living and high fuel prices for people travelling for trips meant it was ""the wrong time to do it"" and he feared people would avoid holidaying in Wales. ""Getting people across the border into north Wales is the hardest thing,"" he added. ""If there's another tax on top, they'll go to the east coast of England,"" he said. Vale of Glamorgan Council leader Lis Burnett, said her authority had ""no plans to introduce a tourism levy"". ""We understand that the proposal is to give discretion to councils as to whether they do and we are not minded to at the moment,"" she told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Shell Island campers (from left) Chloe Riley, Matthew Goff and David Langsdale BBC Wales spoke to three campers visiting Shell Island from Derbyshire. It is one of the UK's largest campsites, with 800 pitches. Chloe Riley said: ""In order to come back to Shell Island in Wales I would still pay the taxâ¦ but it would depend on how much that was going to be."" Ditch Wales' sheep and rugby brand - tourism boss Love Island star to stick with holiday homes plan Her partner, Matthew Goff, agreed he would be willing to pay a tax to return to ""magical"" Shell Island, but added: ""We're a nation of taxpayers. We pay tax on everything. So, why introduce a new tax, in order just to go on holiday? ""People save hard, and is it really the right time to introduce more taxes when everything else has just shot through the roof?"" he asked. Another, David Langsdale, said he had been camping in Wales for years, but the introduction of a tax ""might make me think about going somewhere else if I had toâ¦ I'm a firm believer that I pay taxes in Derby, and when I come on holiday I shouldn't have to pay tax for anywhere else."" ""It might make me think twice about coming to Wales generally,"" he added. Chris Frost of North Wales Tourism says the sector is still recovering from the pandemic Chris Frost, chairman of North Wales Tourism, said businesses understood why the Welsh government was looking at introducing the charge after the influx of visitors, but he said businesses were still struggling to recover post-pandemic. Mr Frost, who owns Manorhaus restaurant with rooms in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said many businesses were still paying back support after being closed or restricted during the pandemic, adding he was going to be paying over Â£900 a month for the next four years. ""With the surges in the supply chains and utilities and food costs, employment costs rising, the cost of doing business at the moment is just absolutely a massive challenge for the industry,"" he said. ""Now is not the time for a consultation on a proposed tourism levy."" Wander Woman travel podcast host Phoebe Smith told BBC Radio Wales introducing a tax for people using accommodation was a ""less than an ideal solution"". ""The people who tend to make the most damage are those who come in and don't give so much back: people on coach trips, people on day trips and people who come on camper vans who don't even use a camp site, they drive in and bring their own food in,"" she said. Paul Williams, manager of Llandudno Pier, says a tourism levy at this time would be 'ludicrous' Paul Williams, general manager of Llandudno Pier, said a potential tax was a ""very bad idea, especially for us being one of the major tourist attractions in north Wales"". ""We've just come out of Covid last year, the last thing we need is a tax on tourism,"" he said. ""It's one of the biggest sectors in north Wales. ""To put a tax on top of it just seems ludicrous, especially at this time."" Currently the Welsh tourism tax - which the Welsh government calls a visitor levy - has lots of unknowns attached to it. We do not know how many councils might be interested in the funding, nor what the economic situation will be like when the policy is implemented, because we don't know when it will become law. We are told it is years away before the Senedd passes the legislation, which means it is likely plans for a levy in Scotland will come to fruition first. There are questions too about how the money will be used. As things stand, councils would get the cash to spend how they see fit, although ministers would like it spent on things that improve the experience for visitors and contribute to the costs related to tourism. If councils are allowed to spend the money with no strings attached, that might be tricky to ensure. We have been told the Welsh government is open to restricting its use in some way, although we were also told that it's difficult to do. This video can not be played What do you think about a tourist tax? The Welsh government said there were more than 90m visits to Wales in 2019, resulting in a combined spend of more than Â£5.9bn. Of those, 10m were overnight stays, bringing in more than Â£2bn. The proposal is part of the Welsh government's cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru where local authorities would be able to introduce the levy and use the money raised to invest in their local area. Ministers agreed it was a ""hot topic,"" but claim levies are common in tourism destinations around the world. Rebecca Evans has previously said any levy would allow councils to ""manage and invest"" in local services, ranging from cleaning beaches to maintaining toilets and footpaths. Welsh Conservative shadow tourism minister Tom Giffard said: ""This policy will put livelihoods at risk as one in seven jobs - 200,000 rely on the tourism industry. What's more, there has been no guarantee that this tax would see any improvement to tourism offers in local communities, and the proceeds are instead likely to get sucked up into council coffers. ""The decision to press ahead with this policy is nothing short of arrogance from the Labour Party, a symptom of their perpetual rule here in Wales.""

"Beyond Meat chief operating officer Douglas Ramsey Vegan food giant Beyond Meat's chief operating officer has been arrested for reportedly biting a man's nose during a row in the US. Douglas Ramsey, 53, faces charges of ""terroristic threatening"" and third-degree battery,court records show,external. He was released after posting a $11,085 (Â£9,711) bond on Sunday. The incident occurred on Saturday night as he left a parking garage in Fayetteville, Arkansas after a football game, a local TV channel said. He became involved in a dispute with another driver and bit the man ""ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose,"" according to KNWA/KFTA, a US television station which cited a preliminary police report. The Fayetteville police did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Could KFCâs vegan burger challenge chicken? The dad who feeds his son burgers almost every day Mr Ramsey previously had a three-decade career at meat processing giant Tyson Foods, where he oversaw the company's poultry and McDonald's business units. He joined Beyond Meat as its chief operating officer in December last year.

Mr Ramsey and Beyond Meat did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment. Beyond Meat - which makes plant-based burgers, sausages and nuggets - made its stock market debut on New York's Nasdaq exchange in May 2019. Its shares surged by more than 160% on their first day of trading, making it one of the most successful initial public offerings in recent years. However, the firm's shares have fallen since then, losing more than 70% of their value this year alone. Last month, Beyond Meat lowered its revenue forecast for the year and said it would cut roughly 4% of its global workforce.

"This video can not be played Footage shows hundreds of people filling streets A man sentenced for carrying a knife at a protest in Leicester at the weekend said he was influenced by social media. Adam Yusuf, 21, received a suspended jail sentence after admitting possessing a knife at a march on Sunday. The protest followed unrest on Saturday in which 25 officers and a police dog were injured. It came amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Leicestershire Police's temporary chief constable, Rob Nixon, told the BBC that social media had played a ""huge role"" in fanning the flames. ""There are significant things on there which are false,"" he said, citing assaults of people and attacks on religious establishments as examples. ""My plea is that please, if people are seeing information on social media, if they can't validate it, please don't circulate it. ""Because what we know people are doing is they are receiving fake news via social media and then they are forwarding it on, so it's amplifying the problem, and it's raising fear."" Rob Nixon said police had been outnumbered by groups of hundreds of people Yusuf, of Bruin Street in Leicester, is one of two people who have already been sentenced in relation to the disorder. Leicester Magistrates' Court heard Yusuf told the probation service he had been ""influenced by social media"" in relation to events taking place near where he lived and was ""upset"". He was sentenced to a year in prison, suspended for 18 months. Sentencing Yusuf, the magistrate told him: ""This behaviour will not be tolerated and brings shame on our city and community relationships."" Police say 47 people have now been arrested in relation to disorder in the city since 28 August. Of these, two people were arrested on Saturday and 18 were arrested on Sunday. Mr Nixon said arrests will continue ""for several weeks, if not months"". ""We have about a 50-strong investigation team that are wrapping across all of these different elements and I know that we're starting to identify imagery of people,"" he said. There was a further protest in Belgrave Road on Sunday afternoon On Monday, Amos Noronha, 20, of Illingworth Road, Leicester was jailed for 10 months after pleading guilty to possession of an offensive weapon following his arrest on Saturday night. A third man, Lukman Patel, 31, of Homeway Road, Leicester, remains in custody after pleading not guilty to possession of an offensive weapon and racially aggravated harassment/alarm/distress. Police said ""proactive patrols"" continued in East Leicester overnight between Monday and Tuesday, and no new incidents had been reported. Mr Nixon saidofficers faced ""significant aggression""over the weekend and 25 were now known to have been injured, although none of the injuries were serious. He said the main disorder on Saturday had been sparked by a protest, and police had not known so many people would become involved. ""At one point we had got a group of probably 200 on one side and we ended up with a group of probably 600 or 700 on the other,"" he said. ""So you've got 800 or 900 people in a really close area, being protected by about 100 or so officers, and I think my officers did an amazing job in really difficult circumstances."" Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday, but police said the area was quiet overnight into Monday. Police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area during the unrest The arrests have included people from outside of the city, including some from Birmingham. ""I think there are people from outside of Leicester that are going onto social media and talking about 'let's get behind this, let's travel to Leicester',"" said Mr Nixon. ""So they are stoking up people from outside of Leicester to try and join a fight, which is probably being fuelled by the social media rhetoric."" Community leaders in the city have joined police in calling for calm. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: ""We often talk about the good community relations in Leicester, but you can never be complacent about it, you can never take it for granted. ""It is always a work in progress and it is quite clear there is work to be done here."" Reading a joint statement from the Hindu and Muslim communities, Pradip Gajjar said: ""The two faiths have lived harmoniously in this wonderful city for over half a century. ""We arrived in this city together, we faced the same challenges together, we fought off racist haters together, and collectively made this city a beacon of diversity and community cohesion. ""We together call upon the immediate cessation of provocation and violence both in thought and behaviour."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"Mike Ashley is to step down from the board of Frasers Group, owner of the Sports Direct chain that the retail billionaire founded 40 years ago. Mr Ashley had already handed over the running of the group to his son-in-law Michael Murray earlier this year. Frasers said Mr Ashley would not be standing for re-election as a director, and would leave the board next month. The company also announced that Mr Ashley will provide the company with Â£100m worth of funding. In a statement, the firm also said Mr Ashley would continue to be available to the board and management for advice ""when called upon"". Mr Murray, Frasers' chief executive, said Mr Ashley had ""built an incredible business over the past 40 years"". Mr Ashley has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business. He first entered the fitness industry as a squash coach before opening his first High Street sports shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in 1982. The Sports Direct business grew as Mr Ashley bought up well-known names such as Dunlop, Slazenger and hat-maker Kangol. It is now the UK's largest sportswear retailer, with more than 400 stores. In 2007, Mr Ashley floated the business as a public company on the London Stock Exchange in a move which valued it at Â£2.5bn. Later that year, his public profile increased when he bought majority control of Newcastle United. However, his tenure was criticised by fans over his ownership style and perceived lack of investment, and he sold his stake in the club in October last year. As well as buying brands, the Sports Direct group also bought chains such as lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and luxury fashion chain Flannels. Mike Ashley may be stepping down from the board of Frasers Group but he is by no means out of the picture though. He is still the group's controlling shareholder with a stake of nearly 70% and has agreed to lend the business Â£100m. Starting out as a single sportswear shop, his retail empire now includes the likes of Game, Jack Wills, and Evans Cycles. The move does, however, mark a significant change of the guard and one which may bring major change to the business, of which Mr Ashley built the foundations for 40 years ago. Read more here In 2018, Mr Ashley bought the House of Fraser department store chain for Â£90m and the following year he changed his company's name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group. As his retail empire grew, Mr Ashley frequently courted controversy. His dealings with the City started badly when shares in Sports Direct halved shortly after the company's flotation. Many investors were unhappy at the way the company was run, but in a Sunday Times interview Mr Ashley called them ""cry babies"", telling the paper: ""Sports Direct should come with a government health warning - this stock is not for the fainthearted."" In 2017, London's High Court heard that the businessman once hosted a management meeting in a pubwhere he drank 12 pints and vomited into a fireplace. The company was also accused of building its success by exploiting workers.  In 2016, in a hearing before MPs, Mr Ashleyadmitted workers at its Derbyshire warehouse had been paid below the minimum wageand that its policy of fining staff for being late was unacceptable. Mr Ashley stepped away from running Frasers Group when he handed over the role of chief executive to Mr Murray in May this year. Michael Murray, Mike Ashley's son-in-law, took over as chief executive of Frasers Group Shortly after taking over the role, Mr Murray became Mr Ashley's son-in-law after marrying his daughter, Anna, in a lavish ceremony at Blenheim Palace. In an interview with the BBC in May, Mr Murray said that Mr Ashley was ""not pulling the strings"". ""We have vocal debates. We agree, we disagree. But ultimately the decision lies with me on the outcome of where we take the company."" Mr Murray is in line for a Â£100m pay-out if he can double Frasers' share price to Â£15 within the next three years. In order to get the payment, the company's share price needs to reach Â£15 for 30 trading days in a row before October 2025. The shares are currently trading at about Â£7.70.

"More than 90 videos and images from the next edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise have been leaked online by a hacker, the game's developers say. The leaked content was posted on Sunday after what is being described as one of gaming's biggest security breaches. Rockstar Games said it remained unclear how the ""network intrusion"" occurred, but confirmed ""early development footage"" from GTA VI had been stolen. The footage was put on the GTAForums site by a user called teapotuberhacker. The hacker claimed to have gained access to the data by breaching Rockstar's internal feed on the Slack messaging app, and invited executives to negotiate to avoid further leaks. Additional revelations could include source code, assets, and testing builds from both GTA 5 and GTA 6, which could be damaging to the company's operations. While the original post has since been removed by moderators, it has been spread widely on social media. Rockstar has reportedly issued takedown orders to remove the footage from YouTube and Twitter. The footage showed animation tests, level layouts and some gameplay demonstrations, and it appeared to confirm a long-running rumour that the game will feature the series' first playable female protagonist. They also revealed the game's setting in a fictionalised version of Miami which was also the setting on 2002's GTA: Vice City. In a statement on Monday, the company said it was ""extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way"". ""Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations,"" it added. Rockstar confirmed it wasdeveloping the game earlier this year,with industry insiders anticipating a 2024 or 2025 release date. Some fans had speculated that the leak could see the game's release delayed, but executives said they did not anticipate ""any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects"". GTA 5 has sold more than 170 million copies since its release in 2013, making it one of the most successful video games of all time. In 2020, its online mode is estimated to have generated more than $900 million (Â£788 million) alone.

"Liz Truss is due to to meet with world leaders including Mr Biden, at the UN General Assembly Liz Truss has said a new trade deal with the United States is unlikely in the ""short to medium term"". The prime minister is in New York for the UN General Assembly, where she will meet US President Joe Biden. The UK government had previously promised a post-Brexit trade deal with the US by 2022. Labour said the lack of a trade deal with the US ""is costing billions in lost potential trade opportunities and holding back growth"". Speaking ahead of her flight to the US, Ms Truss said: ""There aren't currently any negotiations taking place with the US and I don't have an expectation that those are going to start in the short to medium term."" In May, theUK signed a Memorandum of Understandingwith the US state of Indiana. How many trade deals has the UK done? Tax cuts expected in mini-budget Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer? What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK? The US is Britain's biggest individual trading partner and accounts for Â£1 in every Â£6 of UK trade. A deal to make it easier for the two nations to trade with each other had been a much-coveted jewel for the government's post-Brexit crown. But those hopes were dashed in the early months of the Joe Biden's administration. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Trade Secretaries - first Liz Truss, then Anne-Marie Trevelyan - conceded the US had other priorities. President Biden made clear protecting US jobs came first. Resuming free trade discussions has not been on the agenda. Instead, US-UK meetings focused on co-operation around issues such as China and Ukraine. Why did Ms Truss choose to raise this explicitly today? Perhaps to get in first and imply that it is the UK's choice. But also to signal that any threat from the US to refrain from talks unless the UK backed down on an option to dissolve the Northern Ireland Protocol would be empty. For it is Brexit itself - a policy President Barack Obama, when Mr Biden was his deputy, previously said would leave the UK at the back of the queue for a deal - that's likely to have played a key role  in  America's refusal to return to the negotiating table. Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas Symonds said: ""The admission that there is no prospect of a trade deal with the USA is terrible news for the UK economy. ""There is no doubt that the blame for this mess lies at the door of the prime minister, who tarnished the UK's international reputation as foreign and international trade secretary. ""This is an embarrassment for Liz Truss."" Ms Truss said she will use her speech at the UN to try and rally support for Ukraine and ending international energy dependence on Russia. Ms Truss pledged that her government will match or exceed the Â£2.3bn support given to Ukraine's ""inspirational"" troops over the last seven months Since Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February, only the United States has sent more military aid to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In her speech, Ms Truss will point to the recent success of Ukraine's counter-offensives as examples of what the country can achieve with Western backing. ""Ukraine's victories in recent weeks have been inspirational,"" Ms Truss said. ""Time and time again these brave people have defied the doubters and showed what they can do when given the military, economic and political support they need."" Ms Truss's visit to the US is her first foreign trip as prime minister. Political activity and government business have been paused until after the Queen's funeral, which Ms Truss attended alongside other politicians, foreign dignitaries and members of the Royal Family. She is due to meet with world leaders, including Mr Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron. Ahead of her meeting with Mr Macron, Ms Truss said she wanted to have a constructive relationship with France and there were a number of issues they need to work together on. She had previously declined to say whether Mr Macronwas a ""friend or foe""during the Conservative leadership contest. Prepare for the roaring return of politics. Families, businesses, the country face grave threats: soaring prices, crippling fuel costs, the prospect of recession. But, with the funeral now over, the arguments resume - and the demands for action will be loud. The prime minister is already on her first foreign trip in the job. It will mean the returning political conversation will have a diplomatic air - in its opening few hours at least - rather than an immediately intense domestic scrappiness. But that will be back before you know it. Read more from our political editor Supporting Ukraine was a key policy plank of the previous UK government led by Ms Truss's predecessor, Boris Johnson.

"Wu Zunyou's comments have drawn controversy A top Chinese health official has warned locals against touching foreigners, a day after China recorded its first monkeypox infection. In a post on Weibo, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wu Zunyou advised against ""skin-to-skin contact with foreigners"". The post drew controversy, with some labelling it as racist. Comments on the original post have since been disabled from the platform. ""In order to prevent possible monkeypox infection and as part of our healthy lifestyle, it is recommended that 1) you do not have direct skin-to-skin contact with foreigners,"" Mr Wu wrote on his Weibo page on Saturday. In addition, he called for locals to avoid skin-to-skin contact with recent travellers who had returned from abroad in the past three weeks, and with strangers.

It is not clear if they were a Chinese citizen or a foreigner. The post, which was widely shared on social media over the weekend, drew largely critical comments on Weibo. ""This is very inappropriate [to say]. At the start of the pandemic, some foreigners stood up and [defended us] by saying that Chinese people are not viruses,"" wrote one user. ""How racist is this? What about the ones like me who have been living in China for almost ten years? We haven't seen our families in like 3-4 years due to borders being closed,"" wrote another Weibo user, who appeared to be a foreigner. China has imposed some of the world's toughest Covid measures since the start of the pandemic, which have included snap lockdowns, border closures, mandatory testing and travel restrictions.
