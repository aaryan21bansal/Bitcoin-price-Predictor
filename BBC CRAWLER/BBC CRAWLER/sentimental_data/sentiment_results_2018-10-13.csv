" As millions of people travel back and forth on Britain’s Victorian rail network, the space below them is teeming with trade; from MOT centres to gin distillers. But after Network Rail announced the sale of 5,200 units to investment companies, thousands of small and independent firms fear potential rent increases could put their livelihoods in jeopardy. Here are some of the stories of the businesses that give life to the arches. For nearly 60 years, Ronnie Grant has run a business out of the railway arches in Clapham, south London. As a London cab driver, he and a friend set up a Hackney carriage leasing company in 1960. Now at the age of 93, he runs Clapham North MOT, alongside his son George. Ronnie says that when he leased the arches he asked British Rail - who owned them at the time - what they could do with them. ""They said basically anything as long as we paid the rent. And we’re still here,” the D-Day veteran proudly says. Ronnie Grant “It used to be like a little village. There was a lot of buzz but it feels like now we’re the last people standing.” Ronnie, a former racing driver who competed alongside a teenage Ayrton Senna in the 1980s, says Network Rail tried to increase the rent from £33,000 a year to £147,000 several years ago. But he and his son fought off the increase. George Grant “It’s a big battle,” says George. “My dad’s had quite a few battles in his life, certainly in World War Two. But this feels like one of the toughest ones.” Ronnie remains defiant and insists he has to keep working. What happens is you retire and then you die - that’s why I’m not retiring.” George has become involved in Guardians Of The Arches, a group set up to dispute Network Rail’s sell-off of its archway stock. “The archways are one of the rare opportunities in the UK where you can have small businesses that nurture and encourage new ways of working,” he says. “We would have been a poorer place if people like my dad didn’t set up businesses in the arches. We’re trying to save a whole ecosystem, and we will not waver.” Network Rail says selling the arches means they will have more money to spend on improving rail infrastructure. Katie Cullen and her husband Steven Warren have a business selling craft beers and high-quality meats under one roof. The business partners have been running Block and Bottle in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, since April 2017. “It’s a new idea, we’re the first of our kind,” 30-year-old Katie says. They initially wanted to set up in London but found it was going to be too expensive. The reason why we’ve been able to set up the business the way we have is because of the rent we pay.” Katie says the archway’s proximity to the city centre has helped the pair’s butcher and bottle shop get passing trade and expand after just 20 months. And she believes the arches have helped regenerate the area, attracting businesses that might never have got off the ground otherwise. Two companies, Telereal Trillium and Blackstone Group, have agreed to buy thousands of the arches. They say they will provide a ""supportive environment in which these businesses can flourish on a long-term basis"". But Katie and Steve are still worried about the future of their fledgling business. It’s a concern, they say we’re not going to get kicked out and the leases will transfer over. But for people who aren’t on long leases that's a worry. “I personally think the sale is short-sighted because the arches are providing such a huge income for Network Rail every year. “It’s cutting their nose off to spite their face, it’s fixing a short-term problem but creating a much larger long-term problem.” In 2015 Dave Rigby, Mike Hughes, Louise Rivers-Hull and her husband Greg Hull set up Manchester Three Rivers gin distillery. It’s the first micro-distillery to be located in the city, a stone’s throw away from Victoria Station. Dave, the master distiller, has a very personal connection with the arches. “What’s nice for me is that my grandad used to work on the lines above us as a safety officer 70 years ago, and now I’m making booze under the archway. “Aside from that it really is a suitable, affordable place to work. We couldn’t have done it anywhere else.” The group has two arches, one where the gin is made and the other to bottle the product. Both arches also have so-called ""gin schools"" where people can distil their own gin from raw ingredients. But the four friends and business partners fear the sale of the arches could put their factory floor, and gin experience, in jeopardy. Louise Rivers-Hull “Obviously it’s a worry, it’s disappointing to be put in this situation,” says Louise, who previously ran her own PR firm. “I wound down my own business to work on this, because this is where my passion lies. “Communication from Network Rail has been really poor. It’s a case of if you don’t speak up, then nobody else will for you.” Mike adds: “We’re a small business, we’re the backbone of this country and we should be applauded, not hindered. We spent our lives decking this place out, and we don’t want that hard work to go to waste.” Down the road from Manchester Three Rivers, Popup Bikes stands unassumingly, a table and a set of chairs outside its entrance. “It’s more than a bike repair shop,” says Jack Dobiecki. “It’s a place for the bike courier community to meet.” Minutes away from Victoria Station, the shop provides on-the-spot repairs for up to 100 bikes a day and doubles as a community hub with its coffee shop and reading area. Jack Dobiecki Jack, 25, began working at the shop after being a courier. “I was in and out of here all the time, working 10-hour days on the streets. I seem to have fallen into it but it’s a really nice working environment, everyone’s really friendly.” Jack says there’s a camaraderie between businesses in the arches that gives a real sense of community. “The fact that we’re a small independent business in - what will become - a very built-up area in the next five years, makes it very important that we stay. But that’s not exactly in our hands. “So much work has gone into making this shop what it is, we don’t want to move.” In 2011 Ben MacKinnon baked bread as a hobby. “I intended to work on my own two days a week,” he says. Now seven years later E5 Bakehouse takes up three railway arches in Hackney, east London, and employs 90 people. “The arches have given us the chance to grow in the slow, haphazard way that we have. The arches have given us the opportunity to evolve. “Put simply, there was nowhere else I would have been able to start my business.” Ben MacKinnon Ben, 39, feels wedded to the area. His grandparents ran an apron and linen shop in Church Street, not far from his bakery. Alongside his family connection, he thinks there’s something romantic about the arches. “You don’t think about it often, but you hear the shudders [of the trains] and you then find yourself thinking of the people racing backwards and forwards. “It’s a unique thing, ribbons of railway arches running across the capital, really decent spaces that allow the manufacturing businesses somewhere to operate.” But is the sell-off of the arches a worry for Ben? On the one hand, he says, he's happy to see Network Rail go. But on the other, he says there’s a risk that whoever’s going to be taking it on will be ""hell-bent on maximising profit and even looking at selling on the asset in a few years”.

"England is the only part of the UK which charges for prescriptions Patients claiming free prescriptions in England face checks before medicine is issued in an effort to stamp out fraud. Prescription fraud currently costs the NHS in England an estimated Â£256m a year. A new digitised system to be piloted next year will mean pharmacies can instantly verify who is entitled to free medication. But pharmacists have opposed similar plans in the past, saying they harm patient trust. Sandra Gidley from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""What if the computer says no? That is a real dilemma. ""Sometimes somebody has free prescriptions legitimately, they've got a medical exception - they're something like a diabetic - and they might forget to renew it and the computer says no. ""You're not going to stop a diabetic from getting their insulin, for example. ""So I think this is potentially fraught with problems."" Currently, patients either present an exemption certificate or sign the back of their prescription stating they do not have to pay the Â£8.80 charge. The NHS Business Authority runs random checks, but only after the medication has been dispensed. In 2016-17,the number of Â£100 fines it issued for false claims doubledto more than 900,000. The new approach will require pharmacists to check the digital exemption system before handing over medication. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The message is clear. The NHS is no longer an easy target and if you try to steal from it you will face the consequences."" Should the long-term ill have free prescriptions? Free prescriptions 'saving Welsh NHS money' England is the only part of the UK which charges for prescriptions. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the British Medical Association have said many of those fined are not fraudsters, but people who fail to complete paperwork properly or forget to renew their exemption. People with long-term illnesses and those on low incomes were most likely to be affected, they said. Fraud is estimated tocost the NHS Â£1.2bn a year, or about 1% of its total budget. The prescription checks are part of a series of measures intended to prevent Â£300m of fraud by April 2020.

"Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks Nine climbers died when a violent snowstorm destroyed their camp on a Himalayan peak in western Nepal. A five-member South Korean expedition team and four Nepali guides were at the base camp of Mount Gurja when the storm struck, police said on Saturday. The crew of a rescue helicopter began retrieving the victims on Sunday, after attempts the day before were halted by strong winds. The freak accident scattered the bodies as far as 500m (1,640ft) away. ""The recovery mission is in progress,"" police spokesman Sailesh Thapa told the BBC. ""The incident happened due to a snowstorm."" Kim Chang-ho has won awards for his mountaineering efforts Local media report that experienced climber Kim Chang-ho, the first South Korean to reach the summits of the world's 14 highest mountains without using supplemental oxygen, is among the dead. ""The camp was completely destroyed,"" the BBC heard from Myagdi district official Liladhar Adhikari. ""It is not clear what went wrong. ""We assume that the camp may have been set up at a higher altitude than normal, but we will know what exactly happened after a thorough investigation."" Expedition organisers raised the alarm after losing contact with the group, which set off on 7 October, for nearly 24 hours. Sherpa to make record 22nd Everest bid 'Chronicler of the Himalayas' dies at 94 Our perilous trek to school The climbers - led by Kim - had been waiting for a window of good weather so they could reach the summit, when the storm hit Friday. The base camp, which is at least one-day's trek from the nearest village, is at 3,500m (11,483ft), on the 7,193m-high mountain. The rarely-climbed Mount Gurja sits in Nepal's Annapurna region, next to avalanche-prone Dhaulagiri, the world's seventh highest mountain. According to the Himalayan Database, no-one has stood on Gurja's summit since 1996. Only 30 people have successfully climbed to its peak compared with more the than 8,000 people who have reached the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest.

"Protesters demonstrating in support of Riace mayor Domenico Lucano Italy's interior ministry says all migrants in the southern town of Riace, famous for welcoming them, must be transferred away.

He has been put under house arrest amid a national debate about integration. His arrest follows months of tougher migration enforcement from Italy's populist government. Mayor who championed migrants arrested Riace: The Italian village revived by migrants The mayor, known as Mimmo, made headlines around the world for his unusual programme that welcomed migrants to the sparsely-populated town in Calabria, giving them abandoned homes and on-the-job training, in the hope that the new arrivals would rejuvenate the economy.

"Mrs Foster made the comments in an opinion piece in Saturday's Belfast Telegraph The DUP leader has warned the prime minister not to accept a ""dodgy"" Brexit deal she will later regret. Arlene Foster has drawn an explicit parallel with the1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,external. The agreement, signed by Margaret Thatcher, gave the Irish government a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster said Mrs Thatcher ""later deeply regretted the choice she had made."" May cannot recommend Brexit deal says DUP Negotiators working 'day and night' Reality Check: Red lines on Irish border Theresa May relies on DUP support in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons The Anglo-Irish Agreement is seen by many historians as a development which helped lead to the peace process.

Writing in the Belfast Telegraph,externalthe DUP leader says: ""We do not want or need the regrets of another prime minister. ""We want her to stand by her principles and instincts rather than accepting a dodgy deal foisted on her by others."" The article essentially restates the DUP opposition to any Brexit backstop arrangement which would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's single market while the rest of the UK leaves. That would necessitate product standard checks on some goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK. Mrs Foster says: ""Such a barrier cuts right to the heart of what is at stake here. ""The UK is one nation. There should not be international-style borders within it."" Mrs Foster's comments come at a critical stage in the Brexit negotiations. Mrs Foster met the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday Mrs Foster previously said that the prime minister could not ""in good conscience"" recommend a Brexit deal that places a trade barrier on businesses moving goods from one part of the UK to another. Theresa May relies on DUP support in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. The DUP has said it could vote down the government's Budget later this month. The former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has expressed his support for the DUP's position, saying that the party's concerns about last December's backstop have been ""amply justified"". Inan opinion article for the Belfast News Letter,external, Mr Johnson wrote: ""The DUP, and some of us from within government, said at the time it would limit our choices and tie our negotiating hand. ""It is now clear we were right. Its implications for the unity of the United Kingdom are severe."" Mr Johnson also repeated his opposition to Mrs May's Chequers plan, arguing that effectively keeping the whole UK in the customs union and single market would be ""the greatest national humiliation since Suez."" ""It is mortifying enough to see our country set on the way to dismemberment: it is worse still to actively acquiesce in it"", he wrote.

"Walsh and Jones danced the Charleston It was ""all about the dancing"" as Seann Walsh and Katya Jones returned to Strictly Come Dancing for their first time since they were pictured kissing.

Walsh and Jones danced the Charleston to Bills by LunchMoney Lewis. Craig Revel Horwood awarded the pair six points, Dame Darcey Bussell and Bruno Tonioli each gave them seven, while head judge Shirley Ballas awarded them an eight.

"The wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank was watched by an average of three million people, giving ITV its best ratings for the time slot since William and Kate's 2011 marriage. The extended episode of This Morning, from 09:25 BST to 12:30, had some two million extra viewers and a 46% share of the audience, up from its usual 19%. At its peak, 3.9 million viewers tuned in to watch the wedding, held at St George's Chapel in Windsor on Friday. The figures do not include catch-up TV. BBC One did not air the wedding on Friday, although part of it was covered on BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme. How the day unfolded: In full Hold on to your hats: Best wedding moments Royal wedding in pictures Royal wedding guests sell goody bags online 'I wanted my wedding dress to show my scar' ITV said the average ratings for Friday's coverage - presented by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford - were more than three times the typical ratings for that time. On average in 2018, 856,000 viewers tuned in to The Jeremy Kyle Show and This Morning in the same weekday slot. The overnight viewing figures include those watching live and also ITV+1, but consolidated figures -which include those who recorded the broadcast or watched on catch-up services - will not be released for seven days. ITV said the three-hour wedding special helped it win the time slot for the first time since November, and it was the channel's biggest audience at that time since the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. But when the consolidated figures are in, they are unlikely to reach the heights of the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May, which was watched by a combined 11.5 million people. That was comprised of 8.9 million people on BBC One and 2.6 million on ITV.

"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death President Donald Trump has said the US will inflict ""severe punishment"" on Saudi Arabia if the kingdom is found to be responsible for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He said he would be ""very upset and angry if that were the case"", but ruled out halting big military contracts. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia dismissed allegations that it ordered his killing as ""lies"". The interior minister said on Friday that the kingdom was keen to uncover ""the whole truth"", stressing reports ""about orders to kill"" are ""baseless"". What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials had audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi, who writes for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the consulate. The country's Foreign Minister, Mevut Cavusoglu, said Saudi Arabia was not yet co-operating with the investigation. He urged it to do so and allow Turkish officials to enter the consulate. In an interview with CBS News,Mr Trump said that, if true, the fact that a journalist was murdered was ""terrible and disgusting"".,external ""We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment,"" he said. ""As of this moment, they deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes,"" he added. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. However, he said that there were ""other ways of punishing"" than cancelling military contracts, which powers like Russia and China were interested in. ""I don't want to hurt jobs, I don't want to lose an order like that,"" Mr Trump said. Speaking to journalists later, Mr Trump said his first hope had been that Mr Khashoggi was not killed, but ""maybe that is not looking good"". He would probably call Saudi King Salman ""tonight or tomorrow"", he added. On Friday UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC that ""this kind of incident is multiplying"" and urged the international community to respond. He said that, once it was clear what had happened to Mr Khashoggi, governments should decide ""in the appropriate way"" whether to attend an investment conference to be held in the Saudi capital Riyadh this month. This video can not be played Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC's Kamal Ahmed ""we need to know exactly what has happened"" Jim Kim, the head of the World Bank, has already withdrawn from the event. Sir Richard Branson, the head of Virgin, has said he is suspending his role as director of two tourism projects. He has also halted discussions about a $1bn (Â£750m) investmentby the Saudi sovereign wealth fund into Virgin's space ventures. The latest reports suggest an assault and a struggle took place in the consulate. A Turkish security source has confirmed to BBC Arabic the existence of an audio and a video recording.

The recording was recovered from his iPhone, which he gave to his Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz when he entered the consulate, and his iCloud account, the paper added. However, it was not clear how the data could have been uploaded from the watch to iCloud. One source is quoted by the Washington Post as saying men can be heard beating Mr Khashoggi; it adds that the recordings show he was killed and dismembered. ""You can hear his voice and the voices of the men speaking Arabic,"" a separate source told the Post, which employed Mr Khashoggi as a contributing columnist.

"Friends of Jamal Khashoggi and human rights activists staged a protest outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul The disappearance and alleged murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has sparked outrage around the world. It has also sent a chill through writers and activists, in Saudi Arabia and more broadly across the Middle East. They ask: If this could happen to someone as well known and well connected as Mr Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post writer, what else could happen to the less well known? Mr Khashoggi did not position himself as a dissident. A former adviser to two Saudi princes, he criticised some aspects of Saudi policy, like the war in Yemen and the lack of free speech, while praising others, like the social reforms of new Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. He argued for reform rather than regime change - which is a very widespread stance among Saudis. There are many people there who seek a greater voice in how to improve their society without being enemies of the state. Others who have put their head above the parapet are tracking the reaction of Western countries with deep personal concern. They worry about the implications of US President Donald Trump's comments that Mr Khashoggi was not a US citizen, and that arms sales to Saudi Arabia are too important to give up. This case has alarmed not only Saudis, but critics from around the Arab world who worry their governments could adopt the tactics of extraterritorial killings associated with Russia or the previous Iraqi and Libyan governments. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Missing Saudi writer gets blank column Conversely, for some, it also rankles that the wave of revulsion is focused on the fate of a high-profile journalist known personally by many in Washington, more than on the routine ill-treatment of journalists, critics or activists in Saudi Arabia - and elsewhere. Mr Khashoggi's case is an unusually prominent incident, but it is a symptom of deeper trends - of resurgent authoritarianism and intolerance of free expression. Clearly, some states see the media's legitimate scrutiny and criticisms as a hard security threat to which they should respond with physical force. This trend is exacerbated by the escalating use of information warfare. ""Fake news"" alarms everyone, but governments are also using the accusation of ""spreading false news"" to target freedom of speech. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In Saudi Arabia alone, according to Reporters Without Borders (RWB), 15 journalists have been arrested in the past year. The NGO says that one Saudi reporter, Fayez bin Damakh, disappeared from Kuwait in 2017 just before he was due to launch a television channel. There has been no update on his whereabouts. In another indication that the media can be seen as a serious political threat, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE demanded last year that Qatar shut down the state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera. They said this was one of the reasons they imposed a trade embargo on Qatar. But the issue is much wider. As the Jordanian journalist Rami Khouri has written, Khashoggi's case is just the tip of the iceberg of tens of thousands of Arabs imprisoned or killed for speaking their mind. Turkish officials say they have evidence Mr Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate In Syria, which vies with Iraq as the world's most dangerous country for journalists, more than 200 have been killed since the start of the conflict. Just this year an award-winning Palestinian-Syrian photographer was confirmed as having died in custody. The Syrian regime has admitted more than 800 such deaths, out of an estimated 82,000 people who were forcibly disappeared. Meanwhile the family ofMarie Colvin, a Sunday Times journalist killed in a shell attack in Syria in 2012, have brought evidence to a US court this year suggesting the Syrian military tracked journalists' mobile phones in order to target and kill them. Non-state armed groups have also killed journalists and taken them as hostages, with the Islamic State group even forcing them to make propaganda films. Turkey, which has led the outcry against Mr Khashoggi's disappearance from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, is itself the biggest jailer of journalists in the world. Iran, where media have been reporting the Khashoggi case extensively, has its own record of repressing and harassing journalists. American-Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian, who was imprisoned in Iran, subsequently became a close colleague of Mr Khashoggi at the Washington Post. Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman faces a backlash over the disappearance There is a clear global trend of growing threats to journalists. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a record 262 journalists were jailed worldwide in 2017, and 18 were killed. This year alone, 27 have been murdered. Viktoria Marinova, a Bulgarian journalist who highlighted corruption was raped and murdered the same week that Mr Khashoggi disappeared. States have played a part in this alarming trend, and it may reflect a broader sense among authoritarian governments that 70 years on from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the leaders of the world's biggest economies and military powers have a diminished interest in protecting human rights or free speech. Even in the US, where free speech is constitutionally protected, President Trump has said his critics in the media are ""enemies of the people"". With Turkey now setting up a joint investigation into Mr Khashoggi's death with Saudi Arabia, despite having said it has evidence of Saudi responsibility, the case may well become a geopolitical bargaining chip. So far, the outrage over the disappearance has been unmatched by calls for systemic and structural changes when it comes to intolerance and free speech, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. But if the case is seen as a symptom of these deeper trends, this is what is needed.

"Tory MP Heidi Allen says the system ""isn't right"" Chancellor Philip Hammond is facing increasing pressure from Conservative MPs to find extra funding for Universal Credit in his upcoming budget. Tory MP Heidi Allen told the BBC some 30 colleagues had expressed concerns about the flagship welfare system. Reports say 3.2 million households could lose Â£48 a week under the system, which merges six working-age benefits. The work and pensions secretary has admittedit could leave some worse off but defended the system. Esther McVey said the most vulnerable would be protected, and people could take on more work to increase their income. The government has set aside Â£3.1bn to help people affected by the transition to Universal Credit. However, there are still fears families will face hardship. And the architect of the system, former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, has said it needs a further Â£2bn cash injection to enable it to work properly. Read more:What is universal credit? Universal Credit 'not value for money' Watch: Universal Credit is introduced Currently being phased in across the UK, Universal Credit is aimed at making the benefits system simpler and more flexible - so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. It has been criticised for running over budget and causing delays to people's payments, but the plan is to move all existing benefit claimants on to it next year. by Matthew Cole, BBC political correspondent With two weeks until the Budget, calls for the chancellor to address concerns about Universal Credit are growing. Which raises two questions: Will he stump up some cash? And if so, where will he find it? Philip Hammond has hinted he could raise taxes... and possibly cut relief on pension contributions. But whilst that might appease those worried about Universal Credit, he could end up angering ""low-tax Tories"" elsewhere in the Parliamentary party. Clearly, he has a tough balance to keep all sides of his party happy. But if the chancellor decides against including cash in his Budget for the flagship welfare reform, the government might face trouble in the Commons next month. Votes are scheduled on measures connected to the migration of claimants onto Universal Credit - which could be an opportunity for unhappy MPs to rebel. Maria Amos, from Liverpool,told BBC Radio 4's PM programmeshe had had to wait five weeks to get her payment, which had led to feelings of hopelessness. ""I was so frightened,"" she said. ""I didn't know how I was going to cope. ""I [asked], 'can you explain this to me', but they didn't. They [just said] it is the way the system works. ""[In that time] I got behind with my rent by over Â£400 [and] I wasted away."" Ms Allen, a member of the work and pensions select committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Significant numbers of colleagues on my side of the House are saying this isn't right and are coming together to say the chancellor needs to look at this again."" Mr Hammond, who will announce his budget at the end of the month, has hinted he could target tax relief on pension contributions to find extra funds, calling the measure ""eye-wateringly expensive"". Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation - which has carried out numerous studies on the benefit - said the purpose of Universal Credit was a good one, aiming to simplify welfare and make sure people were not losing money by returning to work. But he told Today: ""The problem is that a benefit that was meant to do that... has then had cuts added to it [by former chancellor George Osborne in 2015], and it now means there will be more losers than winners."" Ms Allen said she wanted her party to have the ""political nerve"" to remove the triple-lock protection for pensions, which she said cost the government Â£3bn a year. The triple-lock sees the state pension rise in line with wages, inflation or by 2.5% - whichever is highest. The warning from Tories comes after a number of senior political figures attacked Universal Credit this week, including former Conservative Prime MinisterSir John Majorand former Labour premierGordon Brown. A government spokesman said ministers were listening to concerns but defended Universal Credit, stressing it was based on ""the sound principles that work should always pay and those who need support receive it"".

"Aspire Achieve Advance (3aaa) announced it had ceased trading on Thursday, wishing employers, apprentices and staff ""all the best"" A training provider has been referred to police after it announced it had ceased trading, with 500 jobs at risk. More than 3,000 Aspire Achieve Advance (3aaa) apprentices also face an unclear future after the firm's Department for Education (DfE) contract was axed. The department said it had referred its findings to police, through Action Fraud. 3aaa announced it had ceased trading on Thursday, wishing employers, apprentices and staff ""all the best"". Peter Marples, one of the founders of the Derby-based firm which offered courses in 34 academies across the country, stood aside from 3aaa last month, saying he wanted to spend more time on his health and his family. He has now also stepped down as director and chairman of the Spencer Academies Trust, which runs 18 schools in the East Midlands. Liam McClelland, 18, from Telford, was 13 months into an IT Level 4 apprenticeship with 3aaa. He was shocked when he learned via an email on Friday that the firm had gone under. ""It was all so sudden. I was in the academy last week and everything seemed fine,"" he said. ""I was only two months away from finishing my qualification. ""It's very frustrating, and I fear that the last year has been a waste of time and that all the work I have done is useless. ""The qualification would have given me an equivalent to a first year degree and allowed me to progress in the IT sector. ""There's been no support currently and I've heard nothing from the DfE. ""My main hope is that I can transfer the work I have done so far to another provider."" 3aaa said concerned apprentices, parents or employers could get in touch by email Announcing it had ceased trading on its website, 3aaa apologised ""for any inconvenience"" and said concerned apprentices, parents or employers could email them. A Department for Education spokeswoman confirmed it had terminated its contracts with 3aaa and said its priority was ""finding new training providers as quickly as possible for the affected learners"". She added: ""We have put a specialist team in place to identify new providers and help learners with as little disruption as possible. Following our investigation we have referred our findings to the police, through Action Fraud."" Derbyshire Constabulary said it had received a referral from Action Fraud in relation to 3aaa and ""inquiries were ongoing"". The BBC contacted 3aaa for comment, but has had no response. However, the directorstold the Derby Telegraph in a statement,externalthat the Education Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) told them they would no longer provide progress payments for learners, and added: ""This immediately removes the ability for the company to continue to operate."" They said in the ""extreme circumstances"" they had no option but to close the business. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"Thomas Selinger with the ball that travelled 250 miles across the North Sea and ended up on a Frisian beach A football belonging to a British church team has been found across the North Sea on the beach of a small island off the coast of Germany. Josh Holebon, manager of Stalham Baptist Church FC, in Norfolk, said it was a mystery how it got there. He received an unexpected email last month from Thomas Selinger, who lives in Freiburg and found the ball when visiting Baltrum Island. The ball was marked ""Stalham Baptist"" and he made contact online. Baltrum is off the coast of East Frisia, close to the border with The Netherlands, while Stalham is on the edge of The Broads ""On a sunny day, as we walked along the dunes, I found a football with the inscription Stalham Baptist,"" Mr Selinger said. ""The football was wet and heavy. I asked myself where this ball was coming from, and later I researched and found the team on the internet."" Mr Holebon, whose team has won the Norfolk Christian Football League fair play trophy three times this decade, said: ""It's a complete mystery how it found its way 250 miles (400km) across the North Sea. Thomas Selinger was visiting Baltrum Island when he found the ball ""Our best guess is someone took the ball to the beach in Norfolk and it went in to the sea and found its own way across."" David Child, one of the church's leaders, said: ""Who needs a message in a bottle when you can use the world's favourite game?"" After he had taken the photo, Mr Selinger gave the ball to some children playing on the beach in Baltrum.

"I admit it, I was wrong. When I saida couple of weeks agothat for the past century artists have failed to outwit and outdo Marcel Duchamp (the French conceptual artist who placed a urinal in a gallery in 1917), I hadn't realised that there was an artwork hanging on the walls of a London auction house which was about to do just that. Banksy's Girl With Balloon, 2006, estimated at Â£200,000 - Â£300,000 That ""moment"" at Sotheby's the other day when Banksy's Girl with Balloon sold for Â£860,000 (just over Â£1m with add-ons) and promptly self-destructed in front of a gobsmacked auction room was a match for any of Duchamp's mischievously ironic artworks. This video can not be played The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post Before our very eyes, the familiar Banksy image of the girl with a balloon, for which an unnamed lady paid an unfathomably large sum, was transformed into an entirely new piece, retrospectively titled by the artist, Love is in the Bin. ""At first I was shocked,"" said the winning bidder and proud owner having decided to keep the work, ""but I realised I would end up with my own piece of art history."" And so she has. The idea of destroying one artwork to make another has turned into something of a genre post-Duchamp, who was the past master of the art stunt. In 1953, for example, Robert Rauschenberg famously rubbed out a drawing given to him by the revered Dutch artist Willem de Kooning. The American then spent two months obliterating the original image before mounting the now blank sheet of paper in a gilded frame, onto which his friend Jasper Johns inscribed with the words, Erased de Kooning Drawing. Robert Rauschenberg. Erased de Kooning Drawing by Robert Rauschenberg, is a famous example of destroying one artwork to make another In light of which, and for the sake of clarity, the subject of this review is not a 2006 Banksy canvas in a mock Victorian frame, but the new artwork made by the artist via a remote control device live in the auction room on 5th October 2018. The one with shredded canvas hanging from the bottom of the frame, which is on display at Sotheby's, London throughout the weekend. Love is in the Bin will come to be seen as one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century This is what I think about Love is in the Bin. It will come to be seen as one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century. It is not a great painting that can be compared to a late Rembrandt, or a sculpture to sit alongside Michelangelo's David, but in terms of conceptual art emanating from Duchamp's Dadaist sensibility, it is exceptional. Love is in the Bin isn't a sculpture that sits alongside Michelangelo's David It was brilliant in both conception and execution. Take its initial creation, which was a stunning piece of site-specific, mechanically-aided, performance art; an attention-grabbing spectacle taking place within an attention-grabbing spectacle, which highlighted through dark satire how art has become an investment commodity to be auctioned off to ultra-wealthy trophy-hunters. As an action, it was reminiscent of the K Foundation's spectacle of burning a million pounds on the Isle of Jura in 1994. The difference here was the one million pound object Banksy destroyed could quite possibly be worth more, which, when you think about it, tells you all you need to know about a cynical art world and its values. Imagine you'd saved up all your money to buy a painting you truly loved and then at the very moment you were about to take it home someone came along and shredded it. Would you want your money back? Would you be angry? Sure you would, you loved that piece. But contemporary art is not valued for its inherent aesthetic qualities (although that is how it is presented to us), it is valued pretty much solely on the basis of an artist's reputation. All that matters is the brand, that it is a Banksy, or a Koons, or a Kusama. For a lot of collectors art has become an asset class. Hence the talk after the event wasn't about art but the asset. Will the shredded work be worth more, or less? Surreptitious calls were made suggesting potential buyers were already lining up to purchase it, should it come back on the market. Speculation mounted. Maybe the whole thing was an elaborate prank by Banksy. He could have put the piece up for auction through an associate and then bought it for the staggering sum of Â£1m knowing full well the sale wouldn't go through because the work was about to be destroyed. You wouldn't put that past him, would you? Banksy making a shredder to fit in a frame for Girl With Balloon And what about the shredder? How did that work? Were Sotheby's in on it? If not, just how bad is its security not to spot an inbuilt metal contraption with (I assume) a remote control device installed? Why didn't Sotheby's security detect a metal contraption in the artwork? Duchamp would have loved it all. The provocation, the mystery (he signed his urinal R Mutt to hide his identity), the creation through destruction (he drew a goatee onto a postcard of the Mona Lisa to create an original artwork), the challenging question about the nature of art. What is Love is in the Bin? Is it a painting? Or, is it now a piece of conceptual art? Or should it be classified as a sculpture? Or is it rubbish? Who decides? Who knows? Duchamp would say it is up to you to decide. My view? It is art. Made by an artist who many don't rate but I do. Why? Because he has something to say. You might not agree with him, but at least he is making art that penetrates the public consciousness; art that is in the world, not detached from it; art that raises questions that need an airing. Banksy makes art that, as Hamlet said, holds""â¦the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure."" And what artwork better captures the spirit of our times than Love is in the Bin? I can't think of one.

"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered. In the months that followed, conflicting narratives emerged over how he died, what happened to his remains, and who was responsible. Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. As a prominent Saudi journalist, he covered major stories, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, for various Saudi news organisations. For decades, the 59-year-old was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. In his first column for the Post in September 2017, Khashoggi said he had feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Read excerpts from some of his columns This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz. But he was told he would have to return to pick up the document and arranged to come back on 2 October. ""He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,"" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post. Ms Cengiz accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate on 2 October. He was last seen on CCTV footage entering the building at 13:14 local time. The journalist's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, waited for him outside the consulate for hours Despite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out. She ultimately waited for more than 10 hours outside the consulate and returned the following morning when Khashoggi had still not reappeared. For more than two weeks, Saudi Arabia consistently denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate. Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that the journalist had left the consulate ""after a few minutes or one hour"". ""We have nothing to hide,"" he added. Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? But in a change of tune on 20 October, the Saudi government said a preliminary investigation by prosecutors had concluded that the journalist died during a ""fight"" after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. Later, a Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. The Saudi consulate initially said Khashoggi had left after completing paperwork On 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". Investigators concluded that Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, Mr Shalaan said. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate for disposal, he added. Five individuals had confessed to the murder, Mr Shalaan asserted, adding: ""[The crown prince] did not have any knowledge about it."" The Saudi public prosecution said in late September 2018 that a total of 31 individuals were investigated over the killing and that 21 of them were arrested. Five senior government officials were also sacked, including Deputy Intelligence Chief Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior aide to Prince Mohammed. In January 2019, 11 individuals - who have not been named - were put on trial at the Riyadh Criminal Court in connection with Khashoggi's murder, and the public prosecutor sought the death penalty for five of them. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Human Rights Watch said the trial, which took place behind closed doors, did not meet international standards and that authorities ""obstructed meaningful accountability"". In December 2019, the court sentenced five individuals to death for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for ""covering up this crime and violating the law"", while the remaining three were found not guilty. The public prosecution said Mr Asiri was tried but acquitted ""due to insufficient evidence"", while Mr Qahtani was investigated over the killing but not charged. At a news conference following the verdict, Shalaan al-Shalaan said the public prosecution's investigation had shown that ""the killing was not premeditated"". Ms Callamard dismissed that assertion as ""utterly ridiculous"" and said the trial represented ""the antithesis of justice"", from which the ""masterminds"" walked free. Khashoggi's son Salah met Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince weeks after the murder But Khashoggi's son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, tweeted: ""We affirm our confidence in the Saudi judiciary at all levels, that it has been fair to us and that justice has been achieved."" In May 2020, Salah Khashoggi announced that he and his brothers were ""pardoning those who killed our father, seeking reward from God almighty"", accepting the public prosecution's contention that the murder was not premeditated. Four months later, the Riyadh Criminal Court commuted the death sentences handed to five of the defendants to 20 years in prison. The three others were given sentences of between seven and 10 years. The prosecution said the verdicts were final and that the criminal trial was now closed. Ms Cengiz said the ruling made ""a complete mockery of justice"". ""The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder,"" she added. ""Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body? These are the most basic and important questions that remain totally unanswered."" Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival. Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said on 31 October 2018 that the journalist was suffocated almost as soon as entered the consulate, and that his body was dismembered and destroyed. Writing in the Washington Post on 2 November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared it had been established that Khashoggi ""was killed in cold blood by a death squad"" and ""that his murder was premeditated"". ""Yet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act"" he added. ""Where is Khashoggi's body? Who is the 'local collaborator' to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi's remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions."" Mr Erdogan said he knew the order to kill Khashoggi ""came from the highest levels of the Saudi government"", but that he did ""not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit"". In March 2020, the Istanbul chief prosecutor formally charged Saad al-Qahtani, Ahmad Asiri and 18 other Saudi nationals with murder. Prince Mohammed's two former aides were accused of ""instigating a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instinct"". The others were charged with carrying out ""a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instincts"". Saudi Arabia rejected Turkey's extradition request, so all 20 men were put on trial in absentia in Istanbul in July 2020. Court-appointed Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said their clients denied the charges. In November, the court accepted a second indictment adding another six Saudis to the case. A vice-consul and an attachÃ© were accused of ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"". The four others were charged with destroying, concealing or tampering with evidence. A report released in June 2019 by Agnes Callamard, the special rapporteur, concluded that Khashoggi's death ""constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible"". She also found there was ""credible evidence"" to warrant an investigation into Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials, and said the prince should be subject to the targeted sanctions already imposed by some UN member states against other named individuals allegedly involved in the killing. Ms Callamard said both the investigations into Khashoggi's death by Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""failed to meet international standards"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" She called for the trial in Saudi Arabia of the 11 suspects to be suspended, saying it would ""not deliver credible accountability"". ""The trial is held behind closed doors; the identity of those charged has not been released nor is the identity of those facing the death penalty. At the time of writing, at least one of those identified as responsible for the planning and organising of the execution of Mr Khashoggi has not been charged,"" she noted. The Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, rejected the report, tweeting that it was ""nothing new"" and contained ""clear contradictions and baseless allegations which challenge its credibility"". ""The Saudi judiciary is the sole party qualified to deal with the Khashoggi case and works with full independence,"" he added. Saudi prince 'may be liable for Khashoggi death' In mid-November 2018, Turkey's government said it had shared audio recordings of the killing with Saudi Arabia, the US, the UK, Germany and France. While not officially made public, details of the recordings were included in Ms Callamard's report. The UN special rapporteur noted that she was not able to obtain copies of the recordings from Turkish intelligence or authenticate them. This video can not be played The Jamal Khashoggi secret tapes explained But in one recording, her report says, two Saudi officials are apparently heard discussing how to cut up and transport Khashoggi's body just minutes before the journalist entered the consulate. One is quoted as saying: ""The body is heavy. First time I cut on the ground. If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished."" At the end of the conversation, the other asks whether ""the sacrificial animal"" has arrived. A later conversation recorded inside the consul general's office purportedly features Khashoggi being told by officials: ""We will have to take you back. There is an order from Interpol. Interpol requested you to be sent back. We are coming to get you."" The reports quotes Khashoggi as replying that ""there isn't a case against me. I notified some people outside; they are waiting for me; a driver is waiting for me."" At 13:33 local time, he is heard saying: ""There is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?"" Someone responds: ""We will anaesthetise you."" The report says the conversation was followed by sounds of a struggle, during which people are heard saying, ""Did he sleep?"", ""He raises his head,"" and ""Keep pushing."" Later, there are sounds of movement, heavy panting, and plastic sheets. Turkish intelligence identified the sound of a saw at 13:39, but Ms Callamard said she and her delegation could not make out the sources of the sounds they heard. Investigators searched Belgrad forest for Khashoggi's body Assessments of the recordings by intelligence officers in Turkey and other countries suggest Khashoggi could have been injected with a sedative and then suffocated using a plastic bag, according to the special rapporteur. Turkish officials were not granted access to the Saudi consulate for DNA testing until more than two weeks after the incident. The special rapporteur said there was credible evidence that crime scenes had been ""thoroughly, even forensically, cleaned"" before investigators arrived. Among the areas searched for Khashoggi's remains are the Belgrad forest, which a consular attachÃ© visited on 1 October 2018, and the coastal town of Yalova, the location of a farmhouse allegedly owned by a Saudi national. None of those put on trial have been identified by Saudi prosecutors, but the report by the UN special rapporteur named them, citing information from ""various governments' sources"". According to the report, the five facing the death penalty were Fahad Shabib Albalawi; Turki Muserref Alshehri; Waleed Abdullah Alshehri; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, an intelligence officer who the US says worked for the crowd prince's aide Saud al-Qahtani; and Dr Salah Mohammed Tubaigy, a forensic doctor with the interior ministry. The other six defendants were Mansour Othman Abahussain; Mohammed Saad Alzahrani; Mustafa Mohammed Almadani; Saif Saad Alqahtani; Muflih Shaya Almuslih, reportedly a member of the consulate staff; and Ahmad Asiri, the former deputy intelligence chief. According to interviews conducted by the special rapporteur, the defendants' lawyers argued during a court hearing in January that they were ""state employees and could not object to the orders of their superiors"". Turkish officials identified these men as Saudis suspected of involvement in Khashoggi's murder Three defendants allegedly said that Khashoggi ""started screaming, so they covered his mouth to prevent him from making noise, which accidentally killed him"", according to the report. Ms Callamard noted that she had heard no screaming in the audio recordings from the consulate. Mr Asiri was cited as telling the court that he had ""never ordered the use of force"" to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. Nine of the defendants named by Ms Callamard were previously identified by Turkish officials as members of the 15-strong team of agents sent to Istanbul. Most of the agents arrived at and departed from the city's airport by private or commercial jet the same day as Khashoggi's killing. CCTV footage appears to show vehicles driving them to the consulate, and two hours after Khashoggi's arrival, some of them heading to the consul's residence. The special rapporteur said three men were filmed entering the residence with what seemed like plastic trash bags, and at least one rolling suitcase. Khashoggi's killing was internationally condemned and caused a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and some of its closest allies, including the US. After the murder was confirmed by the Saudis, then US President Donald Trump described it as the ""worst cover-up in history"". However, he defended US ties to the kingdom, a key trading partner. Analysing Trump's Saudi statement line by line Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West This response was widely derided by senators in Congress, who pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed. According to US media reports, the CIA - whose director heard the consulate audio recordings - concluded with ""medium to high confidence"" that Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's killing. Mr Trump denied that and his administration defied a legal requirement to release an unclassified report identifying anyone implicated in ""the directing, ordering or tampering of evidence"" in the case. His successor, Joe Biden, has said he will declassify the report. The US, Canada, France and the UK all levied sanctions against 18 Saudis allegedly linked to the killing. The Saudi crown prince was not among them. Germany, Finland and Denmark were among the European nations to cancel arms deals with Saudi Arabia after the killing.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. CCTV on 2 October at 13:14 shows a man in a black jacket and grey trousers approaching the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul. A brief nod to another man in a blue jacket standing outside and he enters. It is the last image of Jamal Khashoggi alive. What happened in the hours that followed is the subject of a mystery that has not only engulfed both countries, but threatens the reputation of the new Saudi Crown Prince, Mohamed bin Salman, and his country's relationships across the world. The trail began at Istanbul airport in the early hours of that morning. A private jet landed, registered to Sky Prime Aviation Services, a Saudi company. CCTV captured the jet and its nine Saudi passengers. Six others arrived shortly after. They checked into two hotels - the Movenpick and Wyndham Grand - both near the Saudi consulate. Turkey alleges they were a Saudi hit squad sent to murder the high-profile journalist, who had been living in self-imposed exile in the US as his criticism of the Saudi government mounted. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Missing Saudi writer gets blank column A Turkish newspaper published photos and the names of the 15, a government source confirming to me that they were legitimate. I've been told that one of the men, Maher Mutreb, was a colonel in the Saudi intelligence agency based at the kingdom's embassy in London. Another, Muhammad Almadani, is thought to be a forensics specialist. All are reported to be Saudi government employees. Their hotel reservations were for a few days but they stayed only for a few hours, their planes returning to Riyadh that night - one via Cairo and the other via Dubai. The Saudi consulate in Istanbul has provided no CCTV footage to back its assertion that Jamal Khashoggi left the building The allegation from Turkey is that they lay in wait in the Saudi consulate for Jamal Khashoggi's appointment, during which he would receive papers for his forthcoming marriage to Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. She waited outside the consulate and was told to alert the Turkish authorities if he didn't emerge. At 16:30 she sounded the alarm. Just after 15:00, CCTV shows black vehicles moving between the consulate and the consul general's residence, about 200m (650ft) away. Could they have contained Jamal Khashoggi's body? Saudi authorities have flatly denied all allegations and insist that Mr Khashoggi left the consulate the same day. They have provided no footage to back that up. These protesters in Washington blame Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman for Mr Khashoggi's disappearance Individual details of the investigation have been gradually drip-fed to the Turkish media over the past week: the identities of the alleged hit squad a rumour that they took CCTV footage from inside the consulate back with them to Saudi Arabia reports that the Turkish staff at the consulate were suddenly given the day off on 2 October Turkish investigators have begun to search the consulate and have requested access to the residence. Reports are emerging that the Saudis limited the Turkish team, who requested access to the garden and sewerage system. Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been much more cautious. He hasn't directly echoed the accusations of murder but has reiterated his concern and demands for the Saudis to provide CCTV footage. A government source tells me that if he were to pile in too hard at this stage, Turkey would already have been forced to expel the Saudi ambassador and consul general. Ankara is giving Riyadh a little breathing room to co-operate and put forward their version of events, while turning the screw with ever more incriminating leaks through the media. Abdulrahman Elshayyal described Jamal Khashoggi as ""the kindest person"" For Jamal Khashoggi's friends and loved ones, hope is fading fast. ""He was the kindest person I knew,"" says Abdulrahman Elshayyal, a journalist and friend who spoke to Mr Khashoggi two days before he disappeared. ""What's killing me is that there's one part in all of this who's keeping quiet. Until they say something, you can only think the worst has happened."" Given Mr Khashoggi's criticism of Riyadh and the crown prince's record of clamping down hard on dissent, why, I ask, did he make the dangerous move of entering the Saudi consulate here? ""He believed in his countrymen,"" says Mr Elshayyal. ""He was making a stand, as if to say: 'If something happens, people will know that I put my faith in my people - and they won't harm me.'"" The question is, if this is all confirmed, how much will Western policy towards Saudi Arabia change? Critics of Riyadh say the West has long turned a blind eye to Saudi abuses. US President Donald Trump has finally voiced concern over the ""serious situation"" and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says Britain expects ""urgent answers"" from Riyadh - London could hardly keep quiet after the alleged attempted poisoning of the Skripals by the Russian government in Salisbury. Turkey doesn't want to see its vital relationship with Saudi Arabia blown apart at this stage - but if Riyadh and, more specifically, the crown prince himself are proven to have ordered a state-sponsored assassination of this high-profile dissident on foreign soil, it could be a turning point. Perhaps the bitter irony will be that Jamal Khashoggi's impact on the perception of Saudi Arabia and Western relations with it might be more in death than in life.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The head of the United Nations has demanded ""the truth"" over the disappearance of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC he feared such disappearances would happen more regularly and become a ""new normal"". Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, vanished on 2 October after visiting its consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia says accusations it ordered his killing there are ""lies"". Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz, in quotes reported by the official Saudi Press Agency in Friday, said the kingdom was also keen to uncover ""the whole truth"", but added that allegations it had issued orders to kill Mr Khashoggi were ""baseless"". What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists A Turkish security source has told the BBC that officials had audio and video evidence proving Mr Khashoggi, who writes for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the consulate. US President Donald Trump, who has sought to build good relations with Saudi Arabia, pledged to uncover the truth. He told CBS News that there would be ""severe punishment"" if Saudi Arabia is found to have been responsible.,external But he ruled out halting big US military contracts with the kingdom on the grounds that jobs would be lost. Mr Trump on Friday told reporters he would call King Salman of Saudi Arabia to discuss ""the terrible situation in Turkey"". He told me at the International Monetary Fund meeting in Bali: ""We need to have a strong request for the truth to be clear. ""We need to know exactly what has happened and we need to know exactly who is responsible and, of course, when we see the multiplication of this kind of situation I think we need to find ways in which accountability is also demanded."" This video can not be played Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC's Kamal Ahmed ""we need to know exactly what has happened"" He said he believed the legal system should be able to guarantee accountability, but added: ""I must say I am feeling worried [at] this apparent new normal. ""Because this kind of incident is multiplying and it's absolutely essential to make sure that the international community says clearly that this is not something that can happen."" Saudi Arabia is hosting a key investment conference in Riyadh this month. Mr Guterres said that once there was a ""clear answer"" about what had happened, governments should respond ""in the appropriate way"" about whether to attend. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Washington was ""looking for information"" and wanted to understand the ""realities"" of what had happened. ""We express concerns for Mr Khashoggi and his family,"" Mr Mnuchin said. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death But he said he was still planning to attend  the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", starting on 23 October. Jim Kim, the head of the World Bank, has already withdrawn from the event, while Sir Richard Branson, the head of Virgin, has said he is suspending his role as director of two tourism projects. He has also halted discussions about a $1bn (Â£750m) investmentby the Saudi sovereign wealth fund into Virgin's space ventures. On Saturday, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said she was ""horrified"" by reports coming out of Turkey but would still attend the Saudi conference. ""I have to conduct the business of the IMF in all corners in the world. At this point of time my intention is to not change my plans and to be very attentive to the information that is coming out in the next few days,"" she said. The latest reports suggest an assault and a struggle took place in the consulate. A Turkish security source has confirmed to BBC Arabic the existence of an audio and a video recording. What is not clear is if anyone other than Turkish officials has seen or heard them. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi One source is cited by the Washington Post as saying men can be heard beating Mr Khashoggi; it adds that the recordings show he was killed and dismembered. ""You can hear his voice and the voices of the men speaking Arabic,"" a separate source told the Post, which employed Mr Khashoggi as a contributing columnist. ""You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered."" Turkish media reports say officials are investigating sound recordings made by Mr Khashoggi's smart-watch. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this claim. Turkish TV has already broadcast CCTV footage of the moment Mr Khashoggi walked into the consulate for an appointment at which he was due to receive papers for his forthcoming marriage to Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. Separately, a video has emerged of men described as Saudi intelligence officers entering and leaving Turkey. Turkish media say sources have identified a 15-strong team involved in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance.

A Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday ahead of talks expected to take place at the weekend However, the government has agreed to a joint investigation with the Saudis, and a Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday to take part in talks expected over the weekend.

"They're the Beatles for the 21st Century, a global pop sensation that generates mania and devotion in equal measure, and they've sold out London's O2 Arena. BTS, the South Korean seven-member boyband and pin-up stars of the K-pop genre, are performing in the UK for two nights only. And their fans, who call themselves the Army, are over the Moon. We headed for the queues to find out what makes the perfect K-pop fan. Don't know the chants? Then, jog on. Before the boys put a boxfresh trainer-clad foot on to the stage, the Army will be in full swing with their chants. Queue buddies Bianca, 16, from Poland, and Ella, 17, from Ipswich, shyly give us a demonstration, and it's oddly mesmerising. It's a synchronised list of the boys' names, surnames included. Fans talk about how regularly listening to BTS, who mostly sing in Korean, has meant they are inadvertently learning Korean. ""You quite quickly become engrossed in Korean culture,"" says 24-year-old Najma Akther, from Scunthorpe. ""It's like going down a rabbit-hole. I watch K-dramas (Korean TV shows) because of the great visuals and great acting - it's helping me learn Korean. I've only been watching them for a year so I'm not fluent yet."" -- Tricky. The band famously spend days learning the routines. They're tightly choreographed and high intensity, and not ones that fans are willing to demonstrate to us in public. Most practise in their bedrooms, but the talented will post videos of their moves online. Almost a non-negotiable that'll cost you Â£45. It's a BTS-branded, Bluetooth-connected orb which will change colour in sync with the on-stage light show. No old ones or your own version allowed.  They are part of the K-pop world and, to one young fan, ""they bring us all together"". Another is less enthused - ""they're extortionate"". BTS made history by becoming the first Korean musicians to perform in a US stadium BTS, also known as Beyond the Scene and the Bangtan Boys, were founded by Big Hit Entertainment and made their debut in 2013 They are Jin, SUGA, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook, and are all in their early 20s Their performances mix pop, R&B, hip hop and feature tightly choreographed dance routines Hits include DNA - performed at the 2017 American Music Awards, poignant youth anthem Blood Sweat & Tears, and Spring Day, which many fans view as a tribute to the 2014Sewol ferry disasterin South Korea They are record breakers: They beat Harry Styles with the most Twitter engagements in one day and got more YouTube views of their single, Idol, than Taylor Swift's record (they got 45 million views in 24 hours) And, when they topped the US Billboard 200 album chart with new album Love Yourself, South Korea's president congratulated the boys on Twitter: Allow Twitter content?

The lights may be bright, the screams piercing, the heat rising and your senses overloaded but that's still no reason to fling your teddy bear, programme or pictures of yourself at the band. Fan Megan Spence, 21, from Dublin, knows people get overexcited and don't mean to cause harm but worries it's giving the fans a bad name. The problem is bad enough that the O2 makes a point of telling concert-goers not to throw stuff. If you forget, the band members will be there on stage to remind you - be kind, be respectful, love yourself and one another. Cecilia Skram and her mum, Vivian Nielsen, love the band's positive message to accept yourself for who you are It's not enough to just watch and listen, you've got to get involved. And their fans do - in droves. There are fan sites, spaces for translations (the band have had top 10 hits in about 70 countries) and philanthropy projects to raise money for BTS's chosen charities. Even their mums are getting in on the act. Vivian Nielsen, 43, from Oslo, has set up an online community for Army mums. Her 18-year-old daughter, Cecilia Skram, introduced her to the band. ""They focus on loving yourself and accepting yourself for who you are - and they talk about social issues,"" says Cecilia. It's a powerful message among their young fans, and one that appeals to Cecilia's mum too. ""There's not a lot of controversial things involved,"" she says. ""They behave. Onstage there's a bit of thrusting, some moves are questionable but the lyrics are safe."" Chisa, a 28-year-old office worker from Osaka, has seen BTS once, in Japan. ""They were fantastic. 100 out of 10,"" she says. Desperate to see them again, she tried to buy an O2 ticket but missed out. So, she spent nearly Â£900 on a flight to the UK just so she could ""feel the atmosphere"" in the build-up to the concert. Now that's devotion. If you also missed out on a ticket, catch BTS perform on BBC One's The Graham Norton Show on Friday at 10:35 BST. How did BTS become so successful?

"For her wedding, Princess Eugenie made a point of wearing a dress that showed off - rather than hid - a scar left over from a childhood operation. Herdeclaration that ""you can change the way beauty is""has proven an inspiration to many. Readers told us how they, too, are proud of their scars: Christine told us: ""I'm really happy the word is getting out there and that there are people in those positions to be advocates for this."" Like the princess, she had major surgery on her back to treat scoliosis, a condition that causes the spine to bend to one side. ""Celebrities are showing off the fact that they're not bothered by their scoliosis, it helps those younger people who might be struggling with it,"" says Christine, who preferred not to give her surname. The Queen's granddaughter, who had her surgery to treat a curvature of the spine at the age of 12, said she was wearing this particular dress as a way of ""standing up for young people who also go through this."" Christine also showed off her scar at her recent wedding. But she remembers how it felt as a teenager. Having been diagnosed with scoliosis at 14, she underwent surgery five times between the ages of 15 and 17. ""It was quite frightening as I didn't even know what it was, or anyone else who had the condition. I was going through puberty and a lot of changes. ""Your friends are going through expected milestones and you have to play catch up later. It felt like the end of the world... but it's worked out perfectly fine."" Christine missed Year 11 at school and had to retake some GCSEs in college. But she was grateful for the support of her friends. ""At one point I was wearing a full-body plaster cast, from my chin to my hip. School friends all came to sign it."" She still suffers back pain but says yoga and pilates help. Princess Eugenie: 'I wanted my wedding dress to show my scar' Princess Eugenie's dress in detail The best moments from a windswept wedding The view from the royal wedding crowds For Simon Howson-Baggott, 35, his scars are a reminder of a turning point in his life. He doesn't look back at schooldays with fondness, having been given a plastic brace to wear after being diagnosed with kyphosis when he was 12. ""It was a big plastic ugly thing right around the body,"" he says. ""I came up with all sorts of excuses to try not to wear it."" Where scoliosis causes the spine to bend to one side, Simon describes kyphosis as a ""traditional hunchback"". He had to wait until he stopped growing, aged 18, for surgery. But two weeks in hospital and six months' recuperation disrupted his schooling and he left college with no A-Levels. Now he has a good job looking after corporate clients for a social media company, but he says: ""It's been a real struggle."" Surgery left Simon, from Fareham, Hampshire, with a 38cm (15in) scar down his back and another measuring 15cm (6in) along his hip. ""It was horrendous at first but wasn't as painful after about three weeks. Afterwards you feel brilliant. ""I love the scars. I used to tell girls it was a shark bite."" He's even priced up getting a giant zip tattoo - Â£550 ""because it's so big"". But if it's painful on the wallet at least his deadened nerve endings mean he won't suffer under the needle, he jokes. ""I have seen some really cool ones on the internet,"" he says. ""But it's different for blokes. ""It was really cool that Eugenie made a point of highlighting hers. For young kids like I was, you need something to say it's not a big deal. ""Maybe a bit of advice like that would have helped me."" Journalism student Lauren Davidson used to be angry about her scar. At the age of 18, after feeling ""deep pain"" in her stomach and researching her symptoms, she became worried she had an ovarian cyst. However, a doctor told her she was fine. After six months' feeling unwell, she suffered a five-day bout of what she thought was food poisoning. ""I was in pain all over my body. It was horrendous,"" she says. Her doctor took a blood test and after discovering she was anaemic, put her in an ambulance. ""They had to cut me open and see what was wrong,"" says Lauren, 24, from Grimsby. ""I had two blood transfusions."" Eventually, they confirmed the presence of a cyst. ""If the cyst had been found earlier I could have had key hole surgery. It took me a while to get used to this scar."" Since then, the scar has become part of her identity. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I don't cover it. It shows I've overcome something. ""I'd rather walk around with a 6in scar than not be here. I thought it was great to see Eugenie walk around with her scar."" Mel Pollard, 35, welled up with tears when she saw Princess Eugenie proudly displaying her scarred back. Mel's daughter, Connie, was left with a scar on her lower back after undergoing surgery to treat a spinal cord defect when she was just 14 months old. The operation should stop her daughter from suffering problems with walking, her bladder or bowel. And while Connie, now five, has no issue with the scar, Mel still worries. ""When she's older she may feel self conscious about it,"" she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

So Mel, from Warrington, was delighted when she saw Princess Eugenie. ""I had a teary moment,"" she says. ""I showed my daughter when she got back from school that a real-life princess had a scar too. She thought it was brilliant."" ""When she's older I can refer to this and remind her she can wear her scar like a badge of honour, that there's nothing to be embarrassed about, it's not a bad thing."" Scoliosis is a condition thatcauses the spine to bend to one side,,externalmaking the back appear rounded and shoulder blades stick out. It most often starts in children aged 10 to 15 but there is often no known cause. Sometimes it is caused by the bones not forming properly in the womb or other medical conditions, including cerebral palsy. Three to four children in 1,000 need treatment from a specialist. The Scoliosis Association UK says about five out of six people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are female - but it is not known why.

"Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks Nine climbers died when a violent snowstorm destroyed their camp on a Himalayan peak in western Nepal. A five-member South Korean expedition team and four Nepali guides were at the base camp of Mount Gurja when the storm struck, police said on Saturday. The crew of a rescue helicopter began retrieving the victims on Sunday, after attempts the day before were halted by strong winds. The freak accident scattered the bodies as far as 500m (1,640ft) away. ""The recovery mission is in progress,"" police spokesman Sailesh Thapa told the BBC. ""The incident happened due to a snowstorm."" Kim Chang-ho has won awards for his mountaineering efforts Local media report that experienced climber Kim Chang-ho, the first South Korean to reach the summits of the world's 14 highest mountains without using supplemental oxygen, is among the dead. ""The camp was completely destroyed,"" the BBC heard from Myagdi district official Liladhar Adhikari. ""It is not clear what went wrong. ""We assume that the camp may have been set up at a higher altitude than normal, but we will know what exactly happened after a thorough investigation."" Expedition organisers raised the alarm after losing contact with the group, which set off on 7 October, for nearly 24 hours. Sherpa to make record 22nd Everest bid 'Chronicler of the Himalayas' dies at 94 Our perilous trek to school The climbers - led by Kim - had been waiting for a window of good weather so they could reach the summit, when the storm hit Friday. The base camp, which is at least one-day's trek from the nearest village, is at 3,500m (11,483ft), on the 7,193m-high mountain. The rarely-climbed Mount Gurja sits in Nepal's Annapurna region, next to avalanche-prone Dhaulagiri, the world's seventh highest mountain. According to the Himalayan Database, no-one has stood on Gurja's summit since 1996. Only 30 people have successfully climbed to its peak compared with more the than 8,000 people who have reached the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest.

"Facebook first shared details of the attack last week, fearing as many as 50m people had been affected Facebook has said it will not provide identity fraud protection for the victims of its latest data breach. On Friday it revealed 14 million users had highly personal information stolen by hackers. It included search history, location data and information about relationships, religion and more. However, unlike other major hacks involving big companies, Facebook said it had no plans to provide protection services for concerned users. One analyst told the BBC the decision was ""unconscionable"". ""This kind of information could help thieves create social engineering-based theft programmes, preying on the Facebook hack victims,"" said Patrick Moorhead, from Moor Insights and Strategy. Users canvisit this link,externalto find out if they have been directly affected. For the most severely impacted users - a group of around 14 million, Facebook said - the stolen data included  ""username, gender, locale/language, relationship status, religion, hometown, self-reported current city, birthdate, device types used to access Facebook, education, work, the last 10 places they checked into or were tagged in, website, people or pages they follow, and the 15 most recent searches"". Typically, companies affected by large data breaches - such as Target, in 2013 - provide access to credit protection agencies and other methods to lower the risk of identity theft. Other hacked companies, such as on the Playstation Network, and credit monitoring agency Equifax, offered similar solutions. A Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC it would not be taking this step ""at this time"". Users would instead be directed to the website's help section. ""The resources we are pointing people toward are based on the actual types of data accessed - including the steps they can take to help protect themselves from suspicious emails, text messages, or calls,"" the spokeswoman said. She would not say if the help pages in question had been updated since the company discovered the recent breach. News of the hack emerged on 5 October when Facebook said it feared 50m users had been affected. On Friday, the company revised downwards its estimate to ""about 30m"". ""We have not ruled out the possibility of smaller-scale attacks, which we're continuing to investigate,"" Facebook's head of product management, Guy Rosen,wrote in a blog post,external. The stolen data could be highly valuable for hackers, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""What I'm worried about is about being able to break into other accounts,"" he said. ""If you look at the list of data, it's not financial data. But there is stuff in there that's useful for 'knowledge-based authentication', which is definitely important for setting up accounts."" He said Facebook should perhaps offer free premium access to password managers and other similar software. In Europe, the hack means Facebook faces a potential fine of up to $1.63bn (Â£1.25bn), approximately 4% of its annual global revenue. The breach is being seen as the first major test of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force in May. ""Today's update from Facebook is significant now that it is confirmed that the data of millions of users was taken by the perpetrators of the attack,"" the Irish Data Protection Commission wrote on Twitter. ""[The] investigation into the breach and Facebook's compliance with its obligations under GDPR continues.""

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has called accusations it ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul consulate ""lies and baseless allegations"". Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz's denial comes 11 days after Mr Khashoggi was last seen entering the consulate. Turkish sources allege he was then killed by a team of Saudi agents. A Turkish security source told the BBC that officials have audio and video evidence proving the killing. Saudi Arabia has maintained the journalist, a critic of the government, left the building shortly after arriving on 2 October. The interior minister said on Friday the kingdom was keen to uncover ""the whole truth"", according to the official Saudi Press Agency, stressing reports ""about orders to kill"" are ""baseless"". What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Khashoggi case alarms Saudi activists UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed he was ""worried"" by Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, especially as incidents like this were becoming the ""apparent new normal"". ""It's absolutely essential to make sure that the international community says clearly that this is not something that can happen,"" he said. Mr Guterres added it was important to establish ""exactly what has happened"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death US President Donald Trump, who has sought to build good relations with Saudi Arabia, pledged to uncover the truth. Mr Trump told reporters on Friday that he would call Saudi Arabia's King Salman to discuss ""the terrible situation in Turkey"",external, news agency AP reports. However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he is still planning to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", despite a number of other top business leaders pulling out, including Jim Kim, the head of the World Bank. Mr Mnuchin's trip is against the recommendations of the House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee, which wrote to Mr Trump urging him to reconsider the visit. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said she was ""horrified"" by reports coming out of Turkey but would still attend the Saudi conference. ""I have to conduct the business of the IMF in all corners in the world. At this point of time my intention is to not change my plans and to be very attentive to the information that is coming out in the next few days,"" she said. UKtycoon Sir Richard Branson has halted talks over $1bn Saudi investmentin Virgin space firms. The latest reports suggest an assault and a struggle took place in the consulate. A Turkish security source has confirmed to BBC Arabic the existence of an audio and a video recording. What is not clear is if anyone other than Turkish officials has seen or heard them. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi One source is cited by the Washington Post as saying men can be heard beating Mr Khashoggi; it adds that the recordings show he was killed and dismembered. ""You can hear his voice and the voices of the men speaking Arabic,"" a separate source told the Post, which employed Mr Khashoggi as a contributing columnist. ""You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered."" Turkish media reports say officials are investigating sound recordings made by Mr Khashoggi's smart-watch. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this claim. Turkish TV has already broadcast CCTV footage of the moment Mr Khashoggi walked into the consulate for an appointment at which he was due to receive papers for his forthcoming marriage to Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. Separately, a video has emerged of men described as Saudi intelligence officers entering and leaving Turkey. A 15-strong team has been identified by Turkish media who are described as involved in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The BBC has been told that one was Maher Mutreb, an intelligence colonel based in London, and another was thought to be a forensics specialist. Turkey's official line is that Mr Khashoggi is missing but that it knows ""for sure"" he has been killed. A Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday ahead of talks expected to take place at the weekend However, the government has agreed to a joint investigation with the Saudis, and a Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday to take part in talks expected over the weekend. Their arrival came a day after a senior Saudi royal figure, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, was said to have briefly visited Turkey amid signs that the Saudi monarchy was seeking an urgent solution to the diplomatic crisis between the two countries. Mr Khashoggi's disappearance threatens the reputation of the new Saudi Crown Prince, Mohamed bin Salman, and his country's relationships across the world, the BBC's Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen reports.
