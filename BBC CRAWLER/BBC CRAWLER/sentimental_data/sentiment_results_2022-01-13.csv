"Waqass Goraya left Pakistan for the Netherlands where he became a prominent critic of the Pakistani military A man has gone on trial in London, accused of plotting to kill a Pakistani blogger living in the Netherlands. A court heard that 31-year-old Muhammad Gohir Khan was hired as a ""hitman"" by figures said to be based in Pakistan. He was arrested last June and pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to murder. Lawyers said the intended victim, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, had set up a blog on Facebook making fun of the Pakistani military and detailing alleged human rights violations. Kingston Crown Court heard that Mr Goraya, who was living in Rotterdam at the time, ""was known for speaking out against the activities of the Pakistani government and appears to have been targeted for that reason"". The jury was told that Mr Khan, a supermarket worker from East London, was heavily in debt - with the prosecution alleging he reacted ""enthusiastically"" to a proposal by a man named only as ""MudZ"" to kill the Pakistani political activist in exchange for Â£100,000. Leading the prosecution, Alison Morgan QC, said in December 2018 Mr Goraya had received information from the FBI that he was on a ""kill list"" and that he had received threats online and in person, some of which he believed ""were being orchestrated by ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)"", Pakistan's intelligence agency. The court was shown alleged Whatsapp messages between the defendant Mr Khan and a middle-man named as ""MudZ"" appearing to discuss the murder allegedly using a code referencing fishing, with the target on one occasion described as ""a little fish"" as opposed to a ""shark"" and that a ""little knifeâ¦ hook"" would suffice for the job. Another figure mentioned in the messages in relation to the alleged plot was referred to as ""Big Boss"". The prosecution said the defendant had been sent Mr Goraya's home address and photograph, and had travelled to Rotterdam where he purchased a knife, but that he had been unable to locate Mr Goraya and so returned to the UK where he was arrested. Prosecuting lawyer, Ms Morgan QC, told the court Mr Khan accepts sending and receiving all the messages in question and travelling to Rotterdam, but maintains he intended to keep the money and not carry out the murder. The prosecution alleges he did intend on killing Mr Goraya. The trial is set to last around two weeks.

"Dutch monarchs, including King Willem-Alexander, have traditionally travelled in the carriage to the state opening of parliament The Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander has announced that Dutch royals will cease using a historic golden carriage amid a debate over slavery links. Critics say that one side of the horse-drawn carriage, called De Gouden Koets, is decorated with an image that glorifies the country's colonial past. Out of use since 2015, the carriage has traditionally been used to carry Dutch monarchs to the opening of parliament. The move comes amid an ongoing debate in the country over its history. The controversial image featured on the vehicle is called Tribute from the Colonies, and depicts black and Asian people - one of whom is kneeling - offering goods including cocoa and sugarcane to a seated young white woman who symbolises the Netherlands. Seated next to her is a man offering a book to a young boy, which the work's painter, Nicolaas van der Waay, said in 1896 was intended to portray the Netherlands' gift of ""civilisation"" to its colonies. In an official video announcing the move, King Willem-Alexander accepted that the carriage was offensive to a large number of people and called on the country to face the legacy of its colonial history together. ""There is no point in condemning and disqualifying what has happened through the lens of our time,"" he said. ""Simply banning historical objects and symbols is certainly not a solution either. Instead, a concerted effort is needed that goes deeper and takes longer. An effort that unites us instead of divides us. ""As long as there are people living in the Netherlands who feel the pain of discrimination on a daily basis, the past will still cast its shadow over our time,"" he added. The carriage has been out of use for several years and has resided at the Amsterdam Museum since a lengthy restoration project concluded last year. Anti-racism campaigners in the Netherlands have welcomed the move, but have called on the king to take further action to face up to the legacy of colonialism. ""He says the past should not be looked at from the perspective and values of the present,"" said Mitchell Esajas, co-founder of The Black Archives in Amsterdam. ""I think that's a fallacy because also in the historical context slavery can be seen as a crime against humanity and a violent system."" In recent years, many Dutch people have been urging the country to have a reckoning with its colonial past. During the 17th Century the Netherlands conquered large swathes of territory in regions now known as Indonesia, South Africa, CuraÃ§ao and West Papua, and became a key player in the transatlantic slave trade. Last year, the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema,formally apologised for the city's role in the slave trade. The move put her at odds with Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who has rejected calls for a formal state apology.

"Ovo Energy's Perth office is set to close after the energy provider told UK staff it planned to cut a quarter of its workforce. Staff have been told that 1,700 employees across the UK will lose their jobs through voluntary redundancy. It is understood that about 700 people work in the Perth office. Two bases in Edinburgh, one in Cumbernauld and another in Dunfermline will also close as it reduces its UK offices from 10 to three. Only offices in Glasgow, Bristol and London will remain, while more employees will be supported to work from home. Ovo Energy tells staff it will cut 1,700 jobs Energy firm sorry over pet-cuddling warmth advice Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who is also the local MSP, said he was seeking urgent talks with Ovo Energy to understand their decision. Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said he would also be ""seeking answers"" over the scale of job losses at the site. He added: ""This is bad news after all the commitments that were given to the workforce when they took over from SSE."" Mid Scotland and Fife MSP Murdo Fraser said the closure would be a ""substantial blow to the Perthshire economy."" Elaine Dougall, of the Unite union, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, they had not been told how many jobs were at risk in Scotland. She said the union was in discussions with Ovo Energy but employees were ""in a state of shock"". ""The way in which it was delivered via social media and the news was not the best way to learn that your job was potentially at threat."" The job cuts are understood to be linked to the company's acquisition of SSE's household energy business three years ago and the integration of the firm into Ovo. In a letter to staff, Adrian Letts, the boss of Ovo's retail business, said: ""Whilst it is regrettable to be reducing roles across the business and we understand this will be an uncertain time for many, we will fully support all our employees as this process develops over the coming months. ""We are engaging with our recognised trade unions to ensure all receive the right information and support."" The firm also said it would also create a new ""Ovo Academy"" in Glasgow which would create ""new opportunities in the city that hosted COP26 for those who want to be at the forefront of the UK's green revolution."" About 1,000 call centre staff will be trained to become zero-carbon living advisers, with specialist knowledge of green home products and technologies from tariffs, to making homes more energy efficient. It said it would also increase its basic wage to Â£12 an hour, a 15% rise on its previous pay rate. In 2020 the company announced plans toclose its operations in Glasgow's Waterloo Street and Selkirk. The company had to apologise earlier this week after an email sent to customers advised them to keep their heating bills low by ""having a cuddle with your pets"" or eating bowls of porridge.

"The self-isolation period for people who test positive for Covid-19 is being cut to five full days in England, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. From Monday, people will be able to leave isolation after negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Ministers had touted the move as a way to reduce staffing pressures in some sectors, including the NHS. The self-isolation period was cut from 10 to seven days with negative tests on days six and seven back in December. On Thursday, 109,133 positive Covid cases were reported across the UK, the lowest daily figure since 27 December. A further 335 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Look familiar? How rapid tests changed the pandemic Mr Javid said that the country was the ""freest in Europe"" and was ""leading the world in how to live with Covid"". He said the self-isolation period was aimed at maximising activity in the economy while ""minimising the risk of people leaving isolation"". UK Health Security Agency data showed that two-thirds of positive cases were no longer infectious by day five, he said. With a second negative test people will be able to leave isolation ""at the start of day six"", he added. ""These two tests are critical to these balanced and proportionate plans, and I'd urge everyone to take advantage of the capacity we have built up in tests so we can restore the freedoms to this country while we're keeping everyone safe,"" he said. The health secretary told the House of Commons the virus was ""still with us and there are still likely to be difficult weeks ahead"", but added there were encouraging signs in the data that infections were falling in London and the east of England - although they were rising in other parts of the country. Mr Javid also reiterated the government's commitment to compulsory vaccinations for healthcare workers, saying that uptake had been ""very promising"" since the announcement of vaccine mandates. As always with Covid, this move is about balancing harms caused by the virus with those from our response to the virus. Data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests two-thirds of people are no longer infectious after five days of isolation. That is a huge number of people who are isolating for no reason, disrupting education, the economy and people's personal freedoms. Rapid tests ahead of release should capture most of those who are infectious, but not all. The currently policy of release at seven days with two negative tests means about two in five infectious cases are missed, according to the data. What we don't know is just how infectious they are - for most people infectiousness will be declining at this stage. That clearly means there is the potential for more spread of the virus. But as the risks from Covid are reducing so does the need to reassess the trade-offs. Each UK nation sets its own isolation rules and Welsh ministers have saidthey have no plans to cut the self-isolation periodfor people who test positive for Covid-19. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan indicated support for introducing the policy but said it was a decision for Health Minister Robin Swann to make. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting welcomed the reduction in Covid isolation to five days but said testing needed to be ""sorted out"", saying that keyworkers were unable to access tests over Christmas as deliveries had stopped. With the rising prevalence of the Omicron variant, Covid-related absences have been felt across different sectors, with health, transport and education among those impacted. Around 5% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off due to Covid each day during the week ending 9 January - that is 45,736 staff each day on average and up by 28% on the previous week. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, described the change to isolation as a ""pragmatic move"" which health leaders would welcome, ""providing it does not significantly add to the risk of the virus spreading"". Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses which were struggling with high levels of staff absence would welcome the news but said ""too many"" staff were finding it difficult to get hold of the lateral flow tests they needed to prove they could return to work. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry group UK Hospitality, said the work from home guidance was ""causing an economic burden for the hospitality industry"" and said she saw the reduction of the isolation period as a ""a step along the road"" to that being lifted later this month In December, the UShalved its self-isolation requirementfor people who tested positive but did not have symptoms, which led to some suggestions the same could be done in the UK. However, the UK system is different as it requires people to self-isolate from when they develop symptoms if that comes before a positive test. Self-isolation means staying at home and not going out. Adults shouldn't go into work and children shouldn't go to school, you should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies. No-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care. If you have symptoms or test positive, you should: Keep your distance from other members of your household Leave windows open to improve ventilation If possible, sleep and eat in a different room, and use a separate bathroom If you share a bathroom, use it after everyone else and clean it thoroughly If you do not follow the rules on self-isolation, you can be fined. In England, penalties start at Â£1,000 and rise to Â£10,000. What will a reduction in isolation time mean for you, or your family or business?

"Ocado and Next have cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff who must self-isolate because of Covid exposure, the BBC has learned. Both retailers will continue to pay full sick pay to unvaccinated workers if they test positive for the virus. Furniture giant Ikea is also among employers making similar moves, as staff absences rise. Next said it was an ""emotive topic"" but that it had to balance staff and shareholder needs. It is unclear when Next made the change but it is believed to have been recent. Online grocer Ocado confirmed on Thursday that it had adopted the same policy as Next this week. Next currently pays store sales consultants and stock assistants between Â£6.55 and Â£9.21 an hour and warehouse operatives between Â£9.30 and Â£11.26 an hour. But unvaccinated workers who are required to isolate could now receive as little as Â£96.35 a week - the Statutory Sick Pay minimum - unless there are mitigating circumstances. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Ikea cuts sick pay for some unvaccinated staff Covid staff shortages will continue into New Year How can I get my booster jab? Last month,official self-isolation guidance was relaxed,externalfor people who have been jabbed, meaning they do not need to isolate if they have been exposed to a positive case. But there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated close contacts, who must still self-isolate for 10 full days after their date of exposure. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is the minimum amount employers must pay, but some employers offer more than SSP - this is normally known as company or contractual sick pay. Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm C M Murray, said claims of direct discrimination due to this kind of sick pay policy were unlikely to succeed as being opposed to vaccination was  ""unlikely to be a protected belief for the purposes of the Equality Act."" ""While the policy may have a disproportionate impact on those from certain ethnic or religious groups (which could give rise to a claim for indirect discrimination), an employer may well be able to justify the policy on the basis of their legitimate business needs,"" she added. She said where employers are struggling with significant staff absences because of the large case numbers, it ""seemed reasonable"" that they may want to take steps to encourage vaccination amongst their workforce in this way. But she added that employers need to be ""careful that policies are communicated carefully and sensitively"" to avoid employee relations issues. Many companies, including Next, faced labour shortages in 2021 and some are now are seeing mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron Covid strain. This week it emerged that Ikea, which employs about 10,000 people in the UK, had changed its policy on unvaccinated staff who have been exposed to coronavirus. Sick pay cuts will also be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US several major companies have started penalising un-jabbed workers. However, the major UK supermarkets and Amazon told the BBC their policies had not changed. Next's move comes days after it said it was putting up its prices to offset higher wage and manufacturing costs. The retailer said prices for its spring and summer clothing and homeware ranges would climb by 3.7% from a year earlier, while it expects a 6% rise for autumn and winter goods. The company forecasts full-year sales to rise by 7% overall, but it warned it could face a tougher trading environment in 2022 given the financial pressures facing households, such as higher energy bills. In October last year, Next boss Lord Wolfson said the retailer had struggled with labour shortages because workers were not available in the places needed and seasonal workers had proved difficult to recruit. The executive, who supported Brexit, said the problem could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a ""visa tax"".

"This video can not be played Covid: How will Wales' restrictions change in the coming weeks? Most restrictions in Wales will be scrapped over the next two weeks if Covid cases continue to fall, the first minister has confirmed. Measures, brought in to tackle the Omicron variant, will be liftedas Wales moves to alert level zero. Opposition parties had called for an exit plan, with Conservative Andrew RT Daviessaying ""Labour got it wrong"",external. Mark Drakeford said Omicron cases had fallen ""rapidly"" and the rules could now be relaxed ""gradually"". What are the rules in Wales now? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Self isolation period in Wales cut by three days The Welsh government also pointed to the success of the booster campaign in enabling it to lift restrictions, with 1.8 million people having received an extra vaccine dose. There will be a four stage process to lifting the current alert level two restrictions in Wales, depending on cases remaining low: Saturday: Numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event will rise from 50 to 500 Friday 21 January: Crowds allowed to return to sporting events, paving the way for rugby Six Nations full houses in Cardiff, and no limits on those attending outdoor events Friday 28 January: Nightclubs can reopen and hospitality allowed to operate normally, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres. Working from home no longer a legal requirement Thursday 10 February: Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero ""The actions we have taken together have helped us to weather the Omicron storm. The latest data suggests some positive signs that the peak may have passed,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""We can now look more confidently to the future and plan to start gradually removing the alert level two restrictions, starting with the outdoors measures. ""But the pandemic is not over. We will closely monitor the public health situation - this is a fast-moving and volatile variant, which could change suddenly. I urge everyone to continue to follow the rules and have your vaccines to keep Wales safe."" Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Irelandall brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. England was the only UK nation thatdid not announce further rules. In Wales, it meant that from 26 December, sports fixtures were forced behind closed doors without spectators, andvolunteer Parkrun events were cancelled. Nightclubs were closed, and events were limited to a maximum of 50 people outdoors and 30 people indoors. Pubs and restaurants were also restricted to table service, with the rule of six in place, while workplaces and shops were required to impose social distancing measures. Both the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru had called for a roadmap out of restrictions, while the Welsh Rugby Union had been considering moving home fixtures for the Six Nations out of Wales. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford denied the move to relax restrictions was a ""U-turn"", adding: ""Not at all. It's really the opposite of that. ""What we do in Wales is we follow the science, we follow the data. We make difficult decisions when that is necessary."" He added: ""What we are seeing is a very rapid decline of the number of cases in Wales. Last Friday in Wales it was 2,300 cases per 100,000 of the Welsh population, today, only a week later, it is only 1,200."" Mark Drakeford has rejected any suggestions of a U-turn in his approach to these restrictions - he insists the scientific advice he received suggested four weeks of tougher restrictions and he says today's announcement is in line with that time period. He also points out that the Covid numbers have dropped rapidly in the last week. The report from the Welsh government's Technical Advisory Cell before Christmas did talk about four weeks of restrictions, and numbers have plummeted, but it's also the case that we've seen an abrupt change in approach from Welsh ministers over the last couple of days. On Tuesday in the Senedd, in response to Welsh Tory demands for a plan out of alert level two, the first minister quoted modelling saying that ""the peak of the Omicron coronavirus wave has yet to be reached in Wales"", he talked about the number of people suffering from Omicron ""going up not coming down"" and he raised only a heavily caveated possibility of beginning to lift restrictions at the end of next week. At this time, the stats were showing a drop in cases, though Mr Drakeford said the change in the rules over testing meant it was difficult to know whether these were ""genuine falls"" or simply a result of fewer people getting PCR tests. By Thursday, the health minister was striking a much more optimistic note talking about ""very positive signs"" that Wales was ""possibly turning the corner"" on this wave and restrictions will now begin to be lifted this weekend. Today, the cautious tone remains, as you'd expect, but the dogmatism of last Friday's review - where those calling for an easing of restrictions were  described as ""fundamentally wrong"" - has been abandoned as has the pessimism of Tuesday's position. Wales' case rate has fallen to its lowest level since 26 December - 1,274.2 per 100,000 people over seven days. This decline is sooner - and deeper - than a modelled scenario presented only a week ago. Hospital numbers have fallen for two days in a row, although there are still on average a third more patients with confirmed Covid than the week before. It has also emerged that more than half of these patients were in hospital being treated for another primary condition. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care remain stable though and at 21% below the peak seen a year ago. The move to relax restrictions on pubs and restaurants has been welcomed, but there have been warnings that some businesses will struggle to recover after losing trade over the festive period. ""Every day of trading counts because everyone wants to trade their way to recover,"" said chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association Emma McClarkin. She saidon average pubs have lost about Â£16,000 during current restrictionsthat ""they won't recover"". Ms McClarkin said a lot of damage has been done in the period of closure over Christmas The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU)said it was ""delighted"" fans would be allowed for Wales' three Six Nations home gamesin February and March. Parkrun boss, Tom Williams, said he did not think his business should have been impacted in the last round of restrictions. He said: ""We have known since the beginning of the pandemic that physical activity and health are incredibly important when dealing with the Covid infection, and we have known for a while that outdoor environments are incredibly safe."" Meanwhile,Chester FC also fell foul of the restrictions on crowds at sports fixtures, with the four stands of the English club's Deva Stadium actually in Flintshire. Its Vice Chairman Jim Green said he was pleased the club's fans would be able to go to the next home game, but believed this should always have been the case. ""We're still determined to find a long-term solution,"" he said. Parkrun's Tom Williams did not think his business should have been affected in the last round of restrictions Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""I'm pleased they've finally listened to calls from the Welsh Conservatives. ""Despite the detailed scientific evidence from South Africa, Labour ministers clearly overreacted to Omicron, and that has caused significant pain and anguish for families and businesses in Wales. The move comes despite Mr Drakeford saying last Tuesday that Wales was ""in the teeth of the Omicron storm"". Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""If, as it seems, we are indeed at the peak, the right thing to do is see how we can safely respond. ""Raising the limit on outdoor sporting events would be an obvious place to start, moving as swiftly as the continuing improved picture allows in coming days, to lifting other restrictions such as those in hospitality."" Wales has now reached 81% of those eligible for boosters in the Covid vaccination programme, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales.

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 A lawyer for the woman accusing the Duke of York of sexually assaulting her at 17 says a money settlement alone will not be enough for his client. Prince Andrew faces a civil case in the US after Virginia Giuffre sued him, claiming he abused her in 2001. He has consistently denied the claims. A judge has ruledthe case can continueafter Prince Andrew tried to have it dismissed. David Boies, Ms Giuffre's lawyer, told the BBC she wants to be vindicated. Prince Andrew's lawyers had cited a 2009 deal Ms Giuffre signed with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as grounds for the dismissal of the case, arguing she had waived her right to pursue a claim against the royal. But Judge Lewis A Kaplan said the case could continue, adding that this ruling did not determine the ""truth or falsity"" of Ms Giuffre's complaint. The case against Prince Andrew, 61, could now be heard in court later this year. Mr Boies told BBC's Newsnight the ruling was ""an important step"" in moving towards a trial.

In court documents, Ms Giuffre said she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by late billionaire financier Epstein. Part of her abuse involved being lent out to other powerful men, she alleges. Ms Giuffre's lawsuit alleges she suffered ""significant emotional and psychological distress"" Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, said in an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, and her account of them having sex in the US and UK ""didn't happen"". Asked if Ms Giuffre would be open to an out-of-court money settlement, her lawyer said he did not want to ""pre-judge that"", adding there had been ""no suggestion of settlement discussions at this point"". ""A purely financial settlement is not anything I think she is interested in,"" he said. Ms Giuffre filed a civil case in New York in August 2021 under the state's Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed. Now 38, she says the three alleged instances of abuse by Prince Andrew continue to cause her ""significant emotional and psychological distress and harm"". On Thursday, a letter was released signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking  the Queen to strip Prince Andrew of his ranks and titles in the British armed forces.

"Dr Erin Pritchard says using the word midget in packaging is a form of hate speech Marks & Spencer has changed the name of its Midget Gems sweets to avoid offending people with dwarfism after a campaign by a Liverpool academic. Dr Erin Pritchard, a lecturer in disability studies at Liverpool Hope University, argued the word midget was a form of hate speech. M&S has now rebranded the popular treats as Mini Gems. A spokeswoman said the store was ""committed to being an inclusive retailer"". Dr Pritchard, who has achondroplasia, a condition which stunts growth, approached supermarkets and confectionery makers about changing the name of the sweet, raising her concerns that the use of the word ""midget"" had its roots in Victorian freak shows. The supermarket chain has rebranded the popular sweets as Mini Gems She wrote in Big Issue North: ""Often referred to by people with dwarfism as the m-word, it is a term derived from the word midge, meaning gnat or sandfly. ""Its origin automatically dehumanises people like me. It was a term popularised during the Victorian freak show, where many disabled people, including people with dwarfism, were oppressed and exploited."" M&S is the first retailer to react to Dr Pritchard's campaign and has changed the labelling on its packaging. An M&S spokeswoman said: ""Following suggestions from our colleagues and the insights shared by Dr Erin Pritchard, we introduced new Mini Gem packaging last year, which has since been rolled out to all of our stores."" Tesco has also said it will be reviewing the name of its product. A spokesman for the supermarket said: ""We are a diverse and inclusive retailer and we would not want any of our products to cause offence. ""We are grateful to Dr Pritchard for bringing this to our attention."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"The isolation period for people who test positive for Covid has been cut to five full days in England From Monday, people will be able leave isolation from the start of day six after two negative tests While the UK is ""learning to live with Covid"" the NHS will remain under significant pressure, health secretary Sajid Javid says In a fiery exchange, his opposite number Wes Streeting questions why Javid has defended Boris Johnson over parties The PM continues to face calls to resign from Labour and some senior Tories over a drinks party during lockdown He earlier cancelled a visit to Lancashire because a family member tested positive France is relaxing its travel rules for vaccinated Brits, who will no longer need a compelling reason to go there Travel firms say they have seen a sharp rise in bookings to French skiing destinations And England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam is leaving his role Edited by James Clarke That's it from us. We'll be back tomorrow with more live updates on the Covid pandemic throughout the day. Today's live page was brought to you by Becky Morton, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chris Giles, Nathan Williams, Alexandra Fouche and Francesca Gillett, and edited by James Clarke, Emma Owen and Kevin Ponniah. We'll be closing our coverage for the day shortly, but here's a reminder of what's been happening on another eventful one. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played David explains how his daughter was dying, at the time of the Downing Street garden event. Boris Johnson yesterday admitted attending a Downing Street garden drinks event during lockdown - on 20 May 2020, when rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings. At the time Davidâs 25-year-old daughter was dying of a brain tumour. He contactedBBC Radio 5 Liveto explain how the lockdown restrictions at the time affected his family. âWe were told then that her tumour had started to grow, and we should prepare for the worst. Her sister couldnât even come to visit her to say goodbye,"" he says. âWe were trying our best to follow the rules in very difficult circumstances, but the government making these rules were just completely ignoring them.â In London, a man writes a message on the National Covid Memorial Wall. More than 150,000 people have now died with the virus in the UK A healthcare worker administers a dose of the Covid vaccine during a door-to-door vaccination campaign in a slum in Karachi, Pakistan A woman is tested for Covid as she arrives at the annual Gangasagar Fair for Hindu pilgrims in eastern India In Paris a woman holds a placard reading ""unmask my students"" as part of a nationwide day of strikes and protests by French teachers against the government's handling of the crisis. Paul Givan said an inquiry into the Downing Street drinks party must be completed quickly Northern Ireland's first ministersays he doubts the public accepts Boris Johnson's claimhe believed the No 10 party was a work event. Paul Givan also says it was right the prime minister gave an apology, but the PM will be ""tested"" by both the public and his own party. ""Either he takes a decision himself or it will be for the Conservative Party to decide his future,"" he says. Givan wants civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into gatherings to come to a conclusion soon to ""draw a line under this"" and ensure health messaging is ""consistent rather than distracted by what's going on in Downing Street"". Johnson admitted he'd joined colleagues for drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, to thank them for their hard work, but said he ""believed implicitly that this was a work event"". More now on President Bidenâs announcement to deploy military teams to states hit hard by Covid - weâve been examining why the Omicron variant has led to the US having a record number of patients with the virus in its hospitals. In many other countries, public health officials have noted the figure remains significantly lower than during previous pandemic surges. So why is the US different?  Read more on this storyhere. A medical worker about to enter a negative pressure room at a US hospital Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Cases are falling â
down nearly a quarter over the past week compared to the week before. But how much should
we read into this? These, after all, are only the people who come forward for
testing. We know there has
been huge demand on the testing system as cases have hit record levels with
some complaining they have not been able to get tests. With the exception
of Wales, none of the other UK nations count reinfections, which are becoming
increasingly common with the Omicron variant. But despite all
that the scale of the fall in detected cases clearly suggests infection levels
have turned a corner. Data from the
Office for National Statistics, which uses a random survey to estimate the true
infection levels in the population, suggests the rises were slowing up to last
weekend. We will have to
wait until next Wednesday to get figures for this week. But regardless of
that, admissions have already plateaued at just over 2,200 a day on average. The fact this has
happened so quickly â normally it takes 10 days for changes in infections to
filter through to hospital cases â is another illustration of just how
different this Omicron wave is. A man who was fined  Â£100 by police in March 2021 for having three friends in his garden on his birthday during lockdown says Boris Johnson has ""made fools of"" the public. Kieron McArdle tells the BBC the PM should resign over the May 2020 drinks party held in No 10, as it creates a perception of having ""one rule for them, one rule for us"". You can hear more about what happened to him below: This video can not be played Boris Johnson party row: Public 'made fools of' - man fined for gathering A cinema owner who admitted breaching Covid rules has been asked to clarify the grounds of an appeal. Cinema & Co owner Anna Redfern, 45,was given a suspended prison sentence and fined Â£15,000 in Decemberat Swansea Magistrates' Court. She has now lodged an appeal at the city's crown court. In November, Covid passes became a legal requirement in cinemas in Wales,but Redfern refused to enforce them, saying they were ""an infringement on our human rights"". At a hearing today, Judge Paul Thomas QC has said it was ""ambiguous"" whether the appeal is against the conviction or just the sentence. The court's also heard Redfern had called to say she was unable to attend as her mother was ""extremely ill"" and she was ""living off"" about Â£30,000 in savings, with the judge asking about any evidence she was receiving funds from an ""outside source"". Swansea council's prosecutor said Redfern had said she received about Â£55,000 from an online ""crowdfunder"". Read morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be
âcoincidentalâ Covid. Currently 190 people on average a day are dying within 28 days of a
positive test, up from 120 a month ago. But because of the rising numbers of cases weâve seen over
the past month, that figure is catching a growing number of people whose death
may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. About 2,000 people die in the UK each day in winter months
and some of them will, by coincidence, have tested positive recently. You might expect to see, very roughly, about 55 of these
âcoincidentalâ Covid deaths a day, based on the nearly 6% of people in the UK
who have tested positive in the past four weeks (mostly young people at lower
risk of dying). The rise in that figure over the past month would account for more than half of the rise weâve seen in Covid deaths. These coincidental deaths have always been a part of the
figures but become more of a problem for the daily count when thereâs lots of
coronavirus around. We can still get a good picture of the deaths caused by
Covid: doctors registering a death record what caused it. Data from those death registrations take longer to be
published but will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemicâs death
toll. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has on Thursday confirmed that cases of the Omicron variant have
reached a third Chinese city. Official media are reporting that a case of the variant has been
confirmed in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province. Over the last week, cases
have also been confirmed in Tianjin, and Anyang, Henan province. There have been 124 local cases of Covid-19 in China in the last
24 hours. Areas where Omicron has been detected are stepping up precautions in
an attempt to suppress further transmission. The Tianjin government has said it will ban vehicles going into
high-risk areas, even if they are visiting to deliver goods, and thatonly specialised personnel will be involved in this,external. Chinaâs Omicron outbreak comes just weeks beforethe 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is set to begin. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are
also set to travel in the next couple of weeks for the Lunar New Year. China has consistently credited its zero-Covid strategy - which
involves swift lockdowns and large-scale testing drives - for being able to
quash localised outbreaks. This video can not be played Prime minister's apology was 'heartfelt', says cabinet colleague The international trade secretary has backed Boris Johnson, saying he shouldn't resign. Anne-Marie Trevelyan says she was pleased the PM gave a ""heartfelt apology""for attending a party in Downing Street during lockdown. She tells Rajini Vaidyanathan his comments would be a ""reassurance"" for her constituents. Johnson has been driving an ""incredibly effective set of decisions through some incredibly hard times of the pandemic"", she says. But would she have attended the Downing Street party? Travel firms are delighted France has relaxed its travel rules for UK travellers - and they say bookings have jumped. Airline Jet2 says it's seen a ""sharp and immediate"" spike in bookings and searches for flights to French skiing destinations. And tour operator Tui says ski bookings doubled yesterday following reports the rules would change - and it was not alone. ""Bookings to France doubled yesterday even before the announcement and we would expect to see another very positive uptick now it's official,"" says Chris Logan, managing director of Crystal Ski Holidays. Brittany Ferries has also welcomed the change in rules, and Eurostar says it will ramp up the frequency of services in the coming weeks. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will send additional military medical teams to six states buckling under the current Covid-19 surge. Teams of doctors and nurses - a total of more than 120 military personnel - will arrive at medical facilities in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island, Biden has said in the past hour. ""Theyâre heroes, and Iâm grateful for what they do,"" he says. Acknowledging widespread frustration amid yet another Covid-19 wave, the US president again urges Americans to get vaccinated and boosted, calling it the first line of defence. Biden also announces his administration will buy another 500 million at-home Covid-19 tests, in addition to the 500 million already being procured. The White House will also be making high-quality masks available for free, he says, with further details coming next week. More now on the government's announcement it's cutting the minimum self-isolation period for those who test positive for Covid in England to five full days. People will be able to leave their home if they have negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Here's how the new system will work from Monday 17 January. The change is being made because UK Health Security Agency data shows two-thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by day five. Many people have been struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared with 120 million in November. The UK governmenthas published its official daily figures,,externalwhich show another 109.133 people have tested positive with Covid. A further 335 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. There are 19,721 people currently in hospital with Covid, the figures show. These three figures are all down on the previous day. The saga over Novak Djokovic's Australian visa has made headlines around the world since the tennis star was detained in Melbourne last week. The unvaccinated player claims he had been given a medical exemption to enter the country based on a positive Covid test in mid-December. A judge ruled he could stay and take part in the Australian Open, but the government is considering cancelling his visa again. Here we attempt to answer some of the main questions that remain surrounding the case, including whether he actually tested positive. You can see those questions and answers here. This video can not be played Prof Van-Tam uses football analogy to explain Covid timeline Jonathan Van-Tam's colourful analogies have turned the government medical adviser into something of a household name - and earned him praise for how he explains scientific concepts in layman's terms. A Boston United fan, he has often compared stages of the pandemic to a football match. Back in December 2020, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the UK, he said the country had scored an equaliser in the 70th minute, after getting ""an absolute battering"" in the first half. Almost a year later, when Omicron emerged, he said the new variant was like ""picking up a couple of yellow cards"" and everyone needed to ""up their game"" and get their booster. He's also compared the progress on the vaccine to landing a plane and waiting for a train. And explaining the complexities of the rollout, he once said the Pfizer vaccine was like a yoghurt - it can't be taken in and out of the fridge. You can read more of his memorable metaphors here. Poorer nations last month
rejected more than 100 million doses of Covid vaccines
distributed by the global programme Covax, mainly due to their
rapid expiry date, a Unicef official quoted by Reuters says. ""More than 100 million have been rejected just in December
alone,"" Etleva Kadilli, director of the supply division at the UN agency, tells the European Parliament. The main reason for rejection is the delivery of doses with
a short shelf life, she says. Poorer nations have also been forced to delay supplies
because they have insufficient storage facilities, including a lack of fridges for vaccines, she adds. Read more here about vaccinations and the Covax scheme. Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser says he is ""hopeful"" a corner has been turned with Omicron case numbers. Prof Ian Young adds he is now more concerned about hospital pressures during the current wave of Covid. He explains health service staff shortages remain significant with about 6 to 8% of hospital staff off with Covid - on top of absences for other health reasons or leave. There were 58 ""red flag"" cancer procedures cancelled during the first week of January, the latest figures show. Red flag cases can describe urgent and often live-saving procedures. Prof Young adds he hopes to see falling hospital numbers in the ""near future"", as the the NI executive has been meeting today to discuss the Covid situation. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The self-isolation period for people who test positive for Covid-19 is being cut to five full days in England, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. From Monday, people will be able to leave isolation after negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Ministers had touted the move as a way to reduce staffing pressures in some sectors, including the NHS. The self-isolation period was cut from 10 to seven days with negative tests on days six and seven back in December. On Thursday, 109,133 positive Covid cases were reported across the UK, the lowest daily figure since 27 December. A further 335 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Look familiar? How rapid tests changed the pandemic Mr Javid said that the country was the ""freest in Europe"" and was ""leading the world in how to live with Covid"". He said the self-isolation period was aimed at maximising activity in the economy while ""minimising the risk of people leaving isolation"". UK Health Security Agency data showed that two-thirds of positive cases were no longer infectious by day five, he said. With a second negative test people will be able to leave isolation ""at the start of day six"", he added. ""These two tests are critical to these balanced and proportionate plans, and I'd urge everyone to take advantage of the capacity we have built up in tests so we can restore the freedoms to this country while we're keeping everyone safe,"" he said. The health secretary told the House of Commons the virus was ""still with us and there are still likely to be difficult weeks ahead"", but added there were encouraging signs in the data that infections were falling in London and the east of England - although they were rising in other parts of the country. Mr Javid also reiterated the government's commitment to compulsory vaccinations for healthcare workers, saying that uptake had been ""very promising"" since the announcement of vaccine mandates. As always with Covid, this move is about balancing harms caused by the virus with those from our response to the virus. Data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests two-thirds of people are no longer infectious after five days of isolation. That is a huge number of people who are isolating for no reason, disrupting education, the economy and people's personal freedoms. Rapid tests ahead of release should capture most of those who are infectious, but not all. The currently policy of release at seven days with two negative tests means about two in five infectious cases are missed, according to the data. What we don't know is just how infectious they are - for most people infectiousness will be declining at this stage. That clearly means there is the potential for more spread of the virus. But as the risks from Covid are reducing so does the need to reassess the trade-offs. Each UK nation sets its own isolation rules and Welsh ministers have saidthey have no plans to cut the self-isolation periodfor people who test positive for Covid-19. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan indicated support for introducing the policy but said it was a decision for Health Minister Robin Swann to make. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting welcomed the reduction in Covid isolation to five days but said testing needed to be ""sorted out"", saying that keyworkers were unable to access tests over Christmas as deliveries had stopped. With the rising prevalence of the Omicron variant, Covid-related absences have been felt across different sectors, with health, transport and education among those impacted. Around 5% of staff at acute NHS trusts in England were off due to Covid each day during the week ending 9 January - that is 45,736 staff each day on average and up by 28% on the previous week. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, described the change to isolation as a ""pragmatic move"" which health leaders would welcome, ""providing it does not significantly add to the risk of the virus spreading"". Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses which were struggling with high levels of staff absence would welcome the news but said ""too many"" staff were finding it difficult to get hold of the lateral flow tests they needed to prove they could return to work. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry group UK Hospitality, said the work from home guidance was ""causing an economic burden for the hospitality industry"" and said she saw the reduction of the isolation period as a ""a step along the road"" to that being lifted later this month In December, the UShalved its self-isolation requirementfor people who tested positive but did not have symptoms, which led to some suggestions the same could be done in the UK. However, the UK system is different as it requires people to self-isolate from when they develop symptoms if that comes before a positive test. Self-isolation means staying at home and not going out. Adults shouldn't go into work and children shouldn't go to school, you should order online groceries, or ask friends or family to deliver supplies. No-one from outside your household should come inside, unless to deliver essential care. If you have symptoms or test positive, you should: Keep your distance from other members of your household Leave windows open to improve ventilation If possible, sleep and eat in a different room, and use a separate bathroom If you share a bathroom, use it after everyone else and clean it thoroughly If you do not follow the rules on self-isolation, you can be fined. In England, penalties start at Â£1,000 and rise to Â£10,000. What will a reduction in isolation time mean for you, or your family or business?

"Ocado and Next have cut sick pay for unvaccinated staff who must self-isolate because of Covid exposure, the BBC has learned. Both retailers will continue to pay full sick pay to unvaccinated workers if they test positive for the virus. Furniture giant Ikea is also among employers making similar moves, as staff absences rise. Next said it was an ""emotive topic"" but that it had to balance staff and shareholder needs. It is unclear when Next made the change but it is believed to have been recent. Online grocer Ocado confirmed on Thursday that it had adopted the same policy as Next this week. Next currently pays store sales consultants and stock assistants between Â£6.55 and Â£9.21 an hour and warehouse operatives between Â£9.30 and Â£11.26 an hour. But unvaccinated workers who are required to isolate could now receive as little as Â£96.35 a week - the Statutory Sick Pay minimum - unless there are mitigating circumstances. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Ikea cuts sick pay for some unvaccinated staff Covid staff shortages will continue into New Year How can I get my booster jab? Last month,official self-isolation guidance was relaxed,externalfor people who have been jabbed, meaning they do not need to isolate if they have been exposed to a positive case. But there was no change to the guidance for unvaccinated close contacts, who must still self-isolate for 10 full days after their date of exposure. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is the minimum amount employers must pay, but some employers offer more than SSP - this is normally known as company or contractual sick pay. Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm C M Murray, said claims of direct discrimination due to this kind of sick pay policy were unlikely to succeed as being opposed to vaccination was  ""unlikely to be a protected belief for the purposes of the Equality Act."" ""While the policy may have a disproportionate impact on those from certain ethnic or religious groups (which could give rise to a claim for indirect discrimination), an employer may well be able to justify the policy on the basis of their legitimate business needs,"" she added. She said where employers are struggling with significant staff absences because of the large case numbers, it ""seemed reasonable"" that they may want to take steps to encourage vaccination amongst their workforce in this way. But she added that employers need to be ""careful that policies are communicated carefully and sensitively"" to avoid employee relations issues. Many companies, including Next, faced labour shortages in 2021 and some are now are seeing mass absences due to the more infectious Omicron Covid strain. This week it emerged that Ikea, which employs about 10,000 people in the UK, had changed its policy on unvaccinated staff who have been exposed to coronavirus. Sick pay cuts will also be implemented at Wessex Water and in the US several major companies have started penalising un-jabbed workers. However, the major UK supermarkets and Amazon told the BBC their policies had not changed. Next's move comes days after it said it was putting up its prices to offset higher wage and manufacturing costs. The retailer said prices for its spring and summer clothing and homeware ranges would climb by 3.7% from a year earlier, while it expects a 6% rise for autumn and winter goods. The company forecasts full-year sales to rise by 7% overall, but it warned it could face a tougher trading environment in 2022 given the financial pressures facing households, such as higher energy bills. In October last year, Next boss Lord Wolfson said the retailer had struggled with labour shortages because workers were not available in the places needed and seasonal workers had proved difficult to recruit. The executive, who supported Brexit, said the problem could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a ""visa tax"".

"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"".

You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature.

"This video can not be played ""I offer my heartfelt apologies"" - watch Boris Johnson admit to attending the No 10 party in May 2020 Boris Johnson offered a ""heartfelt"" apology for attending drinks in the Downing Street gardens during lockdown in 2020 - something he said he thought was a work event. But will that apology and explanation wash with Conservative MPs? Many of his cabinet colleagues rallied in support of the PM in the hours following the statement. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Health Secretary Sajid Javid praised him on Twitter for offering an apology, while Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove faced the 1922 committee of backbench MPs to remind them of Mr Johnson's plus points. But earlier in the day, some others in the party who chose to speak publicly offered conditional support for their leader in his hour of need. Johnson faces calls to quit after party apology What rules did the Downing Street party break? In full: PM's apology over lockdown drinks party Minister Rachel Maclean said the PM's statement showed he ""recognised the anger and sense of injustice"" of the public, which were feelings she shared. ""I also feel the same, as anybody would,"" she told BBC Two's Politics Live programme. ""I was following the rules. I couldn't see my own children. My own mother was in a nursing home [and] I couldn't see her."" But Ms Maclean said the PM shouldn't resign, and that any conclusions - or punishments - needed to be decided by the inquiry into Westminster lockdown parties, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray. ANALYSIS:What was really going on in No 10 during lockdown? LAURA KUENSSBERG:What next for Johnson after party apology? REALITY CHECK:What rules did Downing Street party break? PROFILE:Party investigator Sue Gray TIMELINE:Alleged government lockdown gatherings Senior Tory Christopher Chope told the same programme he had ""never heard such an abject apology"" during his long years in Parliament, and he believed it was ""genuinely sincere"". He said: ""I think the prime minister showed contrition and had realised he had done the wrong thing in not intervening at the time. ""So, I think when someone makes an apology like that, then reasonable people accept the apology."" Sir Christopher also added the ""caveat"" implied by Ms Maclean, saying the party could revisit the issue of the prime minister's future depending on the outcome of Ms Gray's inquiry. But, he said, ""in the short-term"", the statement was ""a monumental relief... because we didn't think he'd be able to carry on if he didn't answer the basic question of if he was there"". That caveat seemed to be a running theme for those Tories speaking after Mr Johnson's Commons appearance. Stephen Hammond told BBC Radio 4's World at One that he was pleased to hear ""an apology and some transparency"" from the prime minister, saying it was ""important he cleared up some of the speculation about his attendance"". He said he would ""take his word"" that the PM thought the gathering was a work event. But he said others would find it ""surprising"", adding: ""Many of my constituents quite rightly will be sitting here today feeling they've had a bit of an apology, but still feeling very let down. ""And like a number of people, I am still very very concerned that people in Downing Street thought it was acceptable to break the rules. ""But I think the prime minister has at least earned the right for us to wait and see what Sue Gray says."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Others in the Tory ranks were less kind about the PM's performance. In fact, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross went as far ascalling for his resignation- actually phoning Mr Johnson to tell him his position was untenable. The chair of the Public Affairs and Constitutional Affairs Committee, William Wragg, echoed his call, telling BBC Radio 4's PM that Tory MPs were ""frankly worn out of defending what is invariably indefensible"", and that ""for their sakes"" he should resign. And Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi - a long standing critic of Mr Johnson - said any minister, MP or member of staff at any Downing Street party must resign, ""no ifs no buts"". She added: ""The rule of law is a fundamental value - the glue that hold us together as a nation. Once that is trashed by those in power the very essence of our democracy is at stake."" While welcoming the apology, Tory MP Dan Poulter - who also works as a doctor - said it was ""not much consolation to those of us who cared for patients on the frontline of the NHS and saw them die of Covid"". He said if the PM was ""found to have actively misled Parliament, or if he faces criminal sanction (or both), then his position would be untenable"". Sir Roger Gale, who has already written a letter to the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers - the method for MPs to call for a leadership challenge - said that, politically speaking, ""the prime minister is a dead man walking"". He told World at One that Mr Johnson had ""misled the House"" in December when claiming allegations of Covid rule-breaking parties were unfounded - breaking the ministerial code - and that he had left his MPs in ""an impossible situation"". And there were MPs happy to make their critical views known to the BBC privately, with a senior Tory source saying the PM ""had lost what made him so successful with his party"". Others said his performance at PMQs was ""weak"" and ""terrible"", while another said: ""It's growing and growing. He'll have to go."" One Conservative MP told Nick Watt, the political editor at Newsnight, that: ""The PM's statement isn't enough. It won't do the trick. ""He can usually find a small piece of Teflon to help him slip away from trouble. But I think he has finally run out of Teflon."" Actions also sometimes speak louder then words too. During the PM's stint at the dispatch box, the Conservative MPs sat behind his were subdued, avoiding the traditional cheers of support. And they stuck firmly to questions about local projects, like bus routes, and even washing machines. But remember, between the calls for Mr Johnson to quit and others offering tentative support, the majority of the 360 Tory MPs in Parliament are keeping quiet and could fall into either camp. The response to Mr Johnson from the opposition was perhaps unsurprising, with no fewer than eight MPs using PMQs to call for his resignation. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the prime minister ""a pathetic spectacle of a man who has run out of road"", the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said he had ""betrayed the nation's trust"", and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called it a ""shameful attempt"" at an apology. Other MPs joined the vocal outcry, with Green MP Caroline Lucas accusing Mr Johnson of only saying sorry to ""save his skin"", while Labour's Jess Philips said: ""He's not sorry, he's sorry he got caught."" But it is the Conservative Party that will decide Mr Johnson's future, and the conclusions of those MPs which will seal his fate.

BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played David explains how his daughter was dying, at the time of the Downing Street garden event. Boris Johnson yesterday admitted attending a Downing Street garden drinks event during lockdown - on 20 May 2020, when rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings. At the time Davidâs 25-year-old daughter was dying of a brain tumour. He contactedBBC Radio 5 Liveto explain how the lockdown restrictions at the time affected his family. âWe were told then that her tumour had started to grow, and we should prepare for the worst. Her sister couldnât even come to visit her to say goodbye,"" he says. âWe were trying our best to follow the rules in very difficult circumstances, but the government making these rules were just completely ignoring them.â In London, a man writes a message on the National Covid Memorial Wall.

Paul Givan also says it was right the prime minister gave an apology, but the PM will be ""tested"" by both the public and his own party. ""Either he takes a decision himself or it will be for the Conservative Party to decide his future,"" he says. Givan wants civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into gatherings to come to a conclusion soon to ""draw a line under this"" and ensure health messaging is ""consistent rather than distracted by what's going on in Downing Street"". Johnson admitted he'd joined colleagues for drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, to thank them for their hard work, but said he ""believed implicitly that this was a work event"". More now on President Bidenâs announcement to deploy military teams to states hit hard by Covid - weâve been examining why the Omicron variant has led to the US having a record number of patients with the virus in its hospitals. In many other countries, public health officials have noted the figure remains significantly lower than during previous pandemic surges. So why is the US different?  Read more on this storyhere. A medical worker about to enter a negative pressure room at a US hospital Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Cases are falling â
down nearly a quarter over the past week compared to the week before. But how much should
we read into this? These, after all, are only the people who come forward for
testing. We know there has
been huge demand on the testing system as cases have hit record levels with
some complaining they have not been able to get tests. With the exception
of Wales, none of the other UK nations count reinfections, which are becoming
increasingly common with the Omicron variant. But despite all
that the scale of the fall in detected cases clearly suggests infection levels
have turned a corner. Data from the
Office for National Statistics, which uses a random survey to estimate the true
infection levels in the population, suggests the rises were slowing up to last
weekend. We will have to
wait until next Wednesday to get figures for this week. But regardless of
that, admissions have already plateaued at just over 2,200 a day on average. The fact this has
happened so quickly â normally it takes 10 days for changes in infections to
filter through to hospital cases â is another illustration of just how
different this Omicron wave is. A man who was fined  Â£100 by police in March 2021 for having three friends in his garden on his birthday during lockdown says Boris Johnson has ""made fools of"" the public. Kieron McArdle tells the BBC the PM should resign over the May 2020 drinks party held in No 10, as it creates a perception of having ""one rule for them, one rule for us"".

Cinema & Co owner Anna Redfern, 45,was given a suspended prison sentence and fined Â£15,000 in Decemberat Swansea Magistrates' Court. She has now lodged an appeal at the city's crown court. In November, Covid passes became a legal requirement in cinemas in Wales,but Redfern refused to enforce them, saying they were ""an infringement on our human rights"". At a hearing today, Judge Paul Thomas QC has said it was ""ambiguous"" whether the appeal is against the conviction or just the sentence. The court's also heard Redfern had called to say she was unable to attend as her mother was ""extremely ill"" and she was ""living off"" about Â£30,000 in savings, with the judge asking about any evidence she was receiving funds from an ""outside source"". Swansea council's prosecutor said Redfern had said she received about Â£55,000 from an online ""crowdfunder"". Read morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be
âcoincidentalâ Covid. Currently 190 people on average a day are dying within 28 days of a
positive test, up from 120 a month ago. But because of the rising numbers of cases weâve seen over
the past month, that figure is catching a growing number of people whose death
may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. About 2,000 people die in the UK each day in winter months
and some of them will, by coincidence, have tested positive recently. You might expect to see, very roughly, about 55 of these
âcoincidentalâ Covid deaths a day, based on the nearly 6% of people in the UK
who have tested positive in the past four weeks (mostly young people at lower
risk of dying). The rise in that figure over the past month would account for more than half of the rise weâve seen in Covid deaths. These coincidental deaths have always been a part of the
figures but become more of a problem for the daily count when thereâs lots of
coronavirus around. We can still get a good picture of the deaths caused by
Covid: doctors registering a death record what caused it. Data from those death registrations take longer to be
published but will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemicâs death
toll. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has on Thursday confirmed that cases of the Omicron variant have
reached a third Chinese city. Official media are reporting that a case of the variant has been
confirmed in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province. Over the last week, cases
have also been confirmed in Tianjin, and Anyang, Henan province. There have been 124 local cases of Covid-19 in China in the last
24 hours. Areas where Omicron has been detected are stepping up precautions in
an attempt to suppress further transmission. The Tianjin government has said it will ban vehicles going into
high-risk areas, even if they are visiting to deliver goods, and thatonly specialised personnel will be involved in this,external. Chinaâs Omicron outbreak comes just weeks beforethe 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is set to begin. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are
also set to travel in the next couple of weeks for the Lunar New Year. China has consistently credited its zero-Covid strategy - which
involves swift lockdowns and large-scale testing drives - for being able to
quash localised outbreaks.

US President Joe Biden will send additional military medical teams to six states buckling under the current Covid-19 surge. Teams of doctors and nurses - a total of more than 120 military personnel - will arrive at medical facilities in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island, Biden has said in the past hour. ""Theyâre heroes, and Iâm grateful for what they do,"" he says. Acknowledging widespread frustration amid yet another Covid-19 wave, the US president again urges Americans to get vaccinated and boosted, calling it the first line of defence. Biden also announces his administration will buy another 500 million at-home Covid-19 tests, in addition to the 500 million already being procured. The White House will also be making high-quality masks available for free, he says, with further details coming next week. More now on the government's announcement it's cutting the minimum self-isolation period for those who test positive for Covid in England to five full days. People will be able to leave their home if they have negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Here's how the new system will work from Monday 17 January. The change is being made because UK Health Security Agency data shows two-thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by day five. Many people have been struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared with 120 million in November. The UK governmenthas published its official daily figures,,externalwhich show another 109.133 people have tested positive with Covid. A further 335 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. There are 19,721 people currently in hospital with Covid, the figures show. These three figures are all down on the previous day. The saga over Novak Djokovic's Australian visa has made headlines around the world since the tennis star was detained in Melbourne last week. The unvaccinated player claims he had been given a medical exemption to enter the country based on a positive Covid test in mid-December. A judge ruled he could stay and take part in the Australian Open, but the government is considering cancelling his visa again. Here we attempt to answer some of the main questions that remain surrounding the case, including whether he actually tested positive. You can see those questions and answers here. This video can not be played Prof Van-Tam uses football analogy to explain Covid timeline Jonathan Van-Tam's colourful analogies have turned the government medical adviser into something of a household name - and earned him praise for how he explains scientific concepts in layman's terms. A Boston United fan, he has often compared stages of the pandemic to a football match. Back in December 2020, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the UK, he said the country had scored an equaliser in the 70th minute, after getting ""an absolute battering"" in the first half. Almost a year later, when Omicron emerged, he said the new variant was like ""picking up a couple of yellow cards"" and everyone needed to ""up their game"" and get their booster. He's also compared the progress on the vaccine to landing a plane and waiting for a train. And explaining the complexities of the rollout, he once said the Pfizer vaccine was like a yoghurt - it can't be taken in and out of the fridge. You can read more of his memorable metaphors here. Poorer nations last month
rejected more than 100 million doses of Covid vaccines
distributed by the global programme Covax, mainly due to their
rapid expiry date, a Unicef official quoted by Reuters says. ""More than 100 million have been rejected just in December
alone,"" Etleva Kadilli, director of the supply division at the UN agency, tells the European Parliament. The main reason for rejection is the delivery of doses with
a short shelf life, she says. Poorer nations have also been forced to delay supplies
because they have insufficient storage facilities, including a lack of fridges for vaccines, she adds. Read more here about vaccinations and the Covax scheme. Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser says he is ""hopeful"" a corner has been turned with Omicron case numbers. Prof Ian Young adds he is now more concerned about hospital pressures during the current wave of Covid. He explains health service staff shortages remain significant with about 6 to 8% of hospital staff off with Covid - on top of absences for other health reasons or leave. There were 58 ""red flag"" cancer procedures cancelled during the first week of January, the latest figures show. Red flag cases can describe urgent and often live-saving procedures. Prof Young adds he hopes to see falling hospital numbers in the ""near future"", as the the NI executive has been meeting today to discuss the Covid situation. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Novak Djokovic has been drawn to play in the Australian Open despite ongoing uncertainty over whether his visa will be cancelled again by the government. The world number one men's player will defend his title against fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic in the first round. However Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke is still considering using his powers to revoke Djokovic's visa, a spokesman said. Djokovic was temporarily barred entry last week because he is not vaccinated. He said his Covid infection in mid-December met the conditions for foreigners entering Australia, but authorities cancelled his visa on the basis that it was not a valid exemption. Djokovic, 34, was held in immigration detention in Melbourne for five days while he challenged the deportation order. On Monday, a court overturned the government's visa cancellation after finding that immigration officials had not followed proper procedure. Allow Twitter content?

But Mr Hawke said that he was still considering cancelling the Serbian tennis star's visa for other reasons, which could include ""character grounds"" on the basis that he misled the Australian Border Force. Djokovic admitted on Wednesday that he had also broken Covid isolation rules in Serbia after meeting up with people when he knew he was positive with the virus. Why Djokovic is a polarising player What did Djokovic do after testing positive? Is Djokovic saga an unforced error for Australia? He also admitted he had made errors on his travel form into Australia, by ticking a box declaring he had not travelled anywhere 14 days prior to entering the country, when in fact he had been to Spain. Djokovic said this was a ""human error"" made by his agent. However a false declaration on a travel form - accidental or not - is grounds for a visa cancellation. Spanish media have also raised questions, as Serbs are banned from entering Spain unless they are vaccinated or receive special permission to enter.But the Spanish interior ministry denied reports Djokovic was being investigated, Politico reported.,external Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has delegated the decision over Novak Djokovic's visa to his immigration minister, Alex Hawke On Thursday, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison declined to say when a decision might come from his government, quashing press gallery reports that it would be made imminently. ""These are personal ministerial powers able to be exercised by Minister Hawke and I don't propose to make any further comment at this time,"" he said at a press briefing. Government sources told the Sydney Morning Herald,externalthat Mr Hawke was likely to delay delivering his decision until Friday. But in an ominous sign for Djokovic, a figure in the governing Liberal Party warned that the minister was ""strongly leaning towards cancelling"" his visa. Sources close to Djokovic told the newspaper that he would immediately appeal any such order. His legal team are hoping to expedite the appeal process that would see proceedings concluded over the weekend in a bid to allow the Serbian to compete in next week's first round. This video can not be played ""If he plays, I will not watch him"": Watch strong reactions on the Novak Djokovic case in Australia Intense criticism has been aimed at both Djokovic and Australian authorities over the visa row. Australians,and in particular those living in the city of Melbournewhere the Australian Open will take place, have had to endure some of the world's strictest and longest lockdowns during the pandemic. Many have pointed out thatthe rich and famous have been allowed greater freedomsto travel to and from the country than ordinary Australians. The comments under an Australian Open tweet about Djokovic playing Kecmanovic has attracted hundreds of comments showing how divided tennis fans are over the ordeal. ""Please send him home! I'll be boycotting his match if he is scheduled to play for the session I have a ticket for,"" one Twitter user wrote. But a supporter tweeted: ""Now it's time to show everyone who is the best tennis player in the world. Come on Champ, go Novak!"" Djokovic has won 20 Grand Slam titles, a record he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. If he were to add to his tally of nine Australian Open wins, he would become the most successful male player in history. It was a dramatic day here in Melbourne - more for what didn't happen than what did. You could feel the tension and the anticipation in Melbourne Park - especially around the press room - as the time for the Australian Open draw approached - the chatter just before it was ""will he be in it?"". It's quite clear the government has been struggling to deal with this controversy. The closer we get to the tournament - which starts on Monday - without a decision on his visa status, the more indecisive the Australian government looks. Djokovic was training on the court Wednesday and Thursday. On any other occasion that would've sounded normal in the lead up to a Grand Slam, but it's extraordinary that this is happening in Melbourne Park while the immigration ministers mulls over whether to deport him or not.

"Gutierrez-Reed's claim states she remembers loading the gun with rounds labelled as dummy ammunition (stock image) The armourer in charge of weapons used during the filming of Rust has sued the prop supplier, alleging his company distributed ""a mix of dummy and live ammunition"" on set. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins wasfatally shot last yearwhen Alec Baldwin fired a gun during a rehearsal, after being told the firearm was safe. Armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed is seeking unspecified damages from Seth Kenney and PDQ Arm and Prop LLC. Kenney has not yet commented. But in December,he told Good Morning America,external: ""It's not possible that they [the live rounds] came from PDQ or myself personally."" Actor and producer Baldwin hasinsisted he ""didn't pull the trigger""andtold ABC News,externalin December: ""I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them, never."" Alec Baldwin says he did not fire the gun that killed Halyna Hutchins Gutierrez-Reed has filed her legal claim for an unspecified amount in New Mexico state court, the same state where the filming and fatal shooting in October took place. The film's director, Joel Souza, was also injured by the shooting. Court documents state Ms Gutierrez-Reed said police had discovered seven bullets suspected of being live after the shooting, according to AFP. It added that they were distributed among a box of cartridges with other ammunition and cartridge belts intended for the actors to use as accessories. What are prop guns and why are they dangerous? What are the rules for guns on film sets? Kenney and his company ""created a dangerous condition on the movie set, unbeknownst to Hannah Gutierrez Reed"", according to the armourer and her lawyer. Her claim states: ""The ammunition was misrepresented as only dummy ammunition when it contained both dummy and live ammunition. ""Defendants distributed boxes of ammunition purporting to contain dummy rounds but which contained a mix of dummy and live ammunition to the Rust production."" Police investigating the shooting have been attempting to get hold of Baldwin's phone, but despite getting a search warrant several weeks ago, they have been unable to obtain it. Halyna Hutchins was described by colleagues as ""an incredible artist"" The actor hashit back at suggestions that he is not complying, saying specifying exactly what is needed from the phone takes time. Gutierrez-Reed's claim states she remembers loading the gun with rounds labelled as dummy ammunition, and that she shook the box to create the jingling sound that the inert rounds should make. ""To the best of Hannah's knowledge, the gun was now loaded with six dummy rounds,"" the documents said. She said that Covid protocols kept her from entering the church where filming was taking place, so she had to give up control of the gun 15 minutes before the shooting.

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 A lawyer for the woman accusing the Duke of York of sexually assaulting her at 17 says a money settlement alone will not be enough for his client. Prince Andrew faces a civil case in the US after Virginia Giuffre sued him, claiming he abused her in 2001. He has consistently denied the claims. A judge has ruledthe case can continueafter Prince Andrew tried to have it dismissed. David Boies, Ms Giuffre's lawyer, told the BBC she wants to be vindicated. Prince Andrew's lawyers had cited a 2009 deal Ms Giuffre signed with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as grounds for the dismissal of the case, arguing she had waived her right to pursue a claim against the royal. But Judge Lewis A Kaplan said the case could continue, adding that this ruling did not determine the ""truth or falsity"" of Ms Giuffre's complaint. The case against Prince Andrew, 61, could now be heard in court later this year. Mr Boies told BBC's Newsnight the ruling was ""an important step"" in moving towards a trial. What's next for Prince Andrew? What are the accusations against Prince Andrew? Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? Prince's TV interview now critical to case He said: ""I think it's very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims. I don't think she has a firm view as to exactly what a solution should be. ""But I think what's going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she has made."" In court documents, Ms Giuffre said she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by late billionaire financier Epstein. Part of her abuse involved being lent out to other powerful men, she alleges. Ms Giuffre's lawsuit alleges she suffered ""significant emotional and psychological distress"" Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, said in an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, and her account of them having sex in the US and UK ""didn't happen"". Asked if Ms Giuffre would be open to an out-of-court money settlement, her lawyer said he did not want to ""pre-judge that"", adding there had been ""no suggestion of settlement discussions at this point"". ""A purely financial settlement is not anything I think she is interested in,"" he said. Ms Giuffre filed a civil case in New York in August 2021 under the state's Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed. Now 38, she says the three alleged instances of abuse by Prince Andrew continue to cause her ""significant emotional and psychological distress and harm"". On Thursday, a letter was released signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking  the Queen to strip Prince Andrew of his ranks and titles in the British armed forces. In the joint letter, released by anti-monarchy pressure group Republic, they wrote: ""Were this any other senior military officer it is inconceivable that he would still be in post."" Prince Andrew's lawyers could potentially launch an appeal against Judge Kaplan's decision Prince Andrew withdrew from public duties soon after his 2019 appearance on Newsnight. He used the interview to reiterate his denials of Ms Giuffre's claims and explain his one-time friendship with Epstein and the late financier's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. One of Ms Giuffre's allegations is that Prince Andrew abused her at the London home of Maxwell, whoin December was convicted by a juryin New York of procuring teenage girls for Epstein. Prince Andrew's lawyers could potentially launch an appeal against Judge Kaplan's decision - although they would need his permission to do so, and legal commentators say the wording of his decision suggests it would not be granted.

"Raw sewage, microplastics and slurry are coursing through all of England's rivers, putting health and nature at risk, a parliamentary report concludes. Agriculture and water companies are the biggest contributors to this ""chemical cocktail"", the Environmental Audit Committee warns. Car tyre particles, oils and wet wipes are also clogging waterways. The environment minister saidthe report,externalhighlighted areas the government was currently tackling. How clean are the UK's rivers and lakes? River Severn swimmer hospitalised after 'swallowing sewage' People across the country using rivers for activities ranging from sports and swimming to fishing risk falling ill from bacteria in sewage and slurry. The water and riverbanks are also home to rich plant, fish and insect life and are essential to biodiversity. But chemicals, plastics and an excess of nutrients are choking the water. No river in England can be given a clean bill of health, the group of MPs on the committee concluded after months of hearing from experts. Budget cuts are hampering the Environment Agency's ability to stop pollution, says the report. ""Rivers are the arteries of nature and must be protected. Our inquiry has uncovered multiple failures in the monitoring, governance and enforcement on water quality,"" Environmental Audit Committee chairman and MP Philip Dunne said. ""For too long, the government, regulators and the water industry have allowed a Victorian sewerage system to buckle under increasing pressure."" Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: ""We are going further and faster than any other government to protect and enhance the health of our rivers and seas. ""We welcome the Environmental Audit Committee's report which highlights many areas that this government is now tackling."" What a damning finding: every single river in England is contaminated with a cocktail of chemicals, according to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC). No surprise then that the committee's report is so critical of virtually everyone involved in managing the country's rivers. But don't assume that will prompt a sudden flurry of parliamentary or regulatory activity. The EAC has an unusually wide remit for a select committee. It can summon witnesses and request government papers to investigate environmental protection and sustainable development across all government departments. What it can't do is force the government to act on its reports or push its recommendations through Parliament. The committee's main power is to draw attention to any failures or shortcomings.  So the hope will be this report shames the government and its regulatory agencies into raising their game on river pollution. What it can't guarantee is that your local river will actually be cleaned up any time soon. The report makes a series of recommendations to overhaul how the country's rivers are managed. Water companies should be penalised more heavily for sewage discharge and each river should have a designated bathing area by 2025, it suggests. Pollution from intensive farming, in particular from chicken farms, is the most common way rivers are being contaminated, the report says. Excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen leaked into water cause algae to bloom to high levels in water - that's the cause of the thick, bright green layer often seen coating waterways. This can prevent oxygen entering the water, suffocating life beneath the surface. Water pollution causing 'death by a thousand cuts' for rivers Sewage discharged into rivers 400,000 times in 2020 Oils and fats poured down sinks in homes and restaurants is adding to the huge numbers of hygiene items like wet wipes that make their way into waterways. ""Fatbergs"" as big as blue whales have been removed from sewers in cities across England, costing companies and customers around Â£100 million a year, the report noted. 'Fatbergs' made up largely of household products and oils clog sewers at huge cost The committee is calling on the government to ban single use cleaning and hygiene products containing plastics. It also said that poor governance, monitoring and chronic underinvestment in the Environment Agency were a major contributor to the poor state of rivers. The reports singles out Wales and south-west Midlands where the waste from 20 million chickens may be raising the River Wye's phosphorus levels. The committee recommends that new poultry farms should not be permitted in areas where rivers have excess levels of nutrients. Andrew Rumming, a beef farmer at Waterhays farm in Wiltshire, said that it's bad socially, economically and environmentally for agriculture to pollute water courses, calling it ""unacceptable"". He said high demand for cheap chicken was partly to blame. ""It's vital that future farming schemes enable farmers to invest in new technology and infrastructure to tackle potential pollution issues,"" the National Farmers Union (NFU) said. The report says water companies are second only to agriculture in polluting rivers. They regularly discharge raw sewage into rivers and fail to disclose overflows, it says. Algal blooms may be green, blue-green or greenish brown Dumping sewage into rivers is only allowed in exceptional circumstances. Visual evidence of these spills include faeces, tampons and toilet rolls floating on water surfaces or caught in plants. The committee highlighted that community groups often report sewage overflow incidents that are not disclosed by water companies to the Environment Agency - suggesting the problem is much more widespread. The report says that how companies self-monitor must be urgently reviewed. A Water UK spokesperson commented: ""We support the committee's urgent call for action to improve the health of England's rivers. ""Many of the recommendations mirror proposals set out in our recent 21st Century Rivers report, which calls for government, regulators, water companies, agriculture, and other sectors to come together and create a comprehensive national plan to transform our rivers."" How we behave at home and outside also plays a role. Microplastics worn away from car tyres and brakes are being washed from busy roads into rivers - the committee said National Highways and the Environment Agency are not doing enough to prevent this pollution. Environmental issues are devolved but a UK-wide survey of river quality has been recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee because the same problems are likely to be occurring in Scotland and Wales.

"M&S's Percy Pig character fronted its Christmas campaign this year Marks & Spencer and Tesco saw sales soar over Christmas as both retailers forecast strong full-year profits. M&S said its food business reported its highest-ever revenue for Christmas, while Tesco said it was an ""exceptional"" festive period for sales. Tesco now expects annual income to hit the top end of forecasts at Â£2.6bn. Meanwhile, M&S said it was ""now more confident"" of reaching previous expectations of at least Â£500m in profits for the full-year. Tesco's chief executive Ken Murphy said that ""once again, Covid-19 led to a greater focus on celebrating at home"". As a result, Tesco's Christmas sales in the UK rose by 0.3% compared to the previous year and were 9.2% higher than the pre-pandemic festive period in 2019. Earlier this week, Sainsbury's also reported strong Christmas sales with more people choosing to eat at home rather than venture out amid the emergence of the Omicron variant. M&S - whose Christmas campaign was fronted by its Percy Pig confectionary character - said sales within its food division rose to Â£1.9bn in the three months to 1 January - a 10% increase on 2020 and up 12.4% on pre-Covid levels. Tesco and M&S have had a cracking Christmas. Other big retailers have also reported bumper sales. Despite all the supply chain problems, labour shortages and the arrival of the Omicron variant, the all-important festive trading was pretty decent for the industry overall. Supermarkets were up against some tough comparisons after last year's record-breaking performance, when Covid restrictions caused a boom in food sales. But they've been buoyant this time round, too. People wanted to treat themselves and there was more eating and drinking at home. And after all the fears of empty shelves and shortages, there was plenty of food. Consumers were in the mood to spend on non-food as well. They were also prepared to pay full price to make sure they got what they wanted, boosting retailers' profit margins. There may have been a little less choice but the demand, at least, was there. Retailers are now wondering what will happen to consumer spending given the looming squeeze on living standards from rising bills and the increase in national insurance contributions.  They're also having to deal with their own soaring costs and continuing supply chain issues. So having had much to celebrate this Christmas, there are lots of uncertainties ahead. The retailer said that customers were already using M&S for more of their everyday shopping items and it said ""the larger basket sizes we saw in the first half continued through the Christmas period"". M&S said total sales for the three month period rose by 18.6% to Â£2,9bn compared to the previous quarter. They were also 8.9% ahead of 2019. Revenue from its clothing and home division also rose but this was driven by online sales. In-store clothing and home demand fell by 10.8% compared to pre-Covid levels which M&S said reflected a trend already evident before the pandemic that more people were shopping online. It also said shops at retail parks continued to outperform stores in city centres. M&S's chief executive Steve Rowe said: ""The market continues to be impacted by the headwinds and tailwinds that we reported in the first half."" At the time, Mr Rowe said: ""Well-publicised supply chain pressure, combined with pandemic supply interruptions, rising labour costs, EU border challenges and tax increases means the cost incline becomes steeper in the second half and steeper again in the 2022-23 year."" But on Thursday Mr Rowe said: ""I remain encouraged that our transformation plan is now driving improved performance."" At Tesco, Mr Murphy said: ""Despite growing cost pressures and supply chain challenges in the industry, we continued to invest to protect availability."" In terms of staff shortages and a dearth of lorry drivers which has affected all areas of the retail sector, Mr Murphy said there had been improvements since summer. While he said it would be wrong to say there are no issues, ""we're managing"".

"Ovo Energy's chief executive Stephen Fitzpatrick Ovo Energy, the UK gas and electricity provider, has told staff it plans to cut a quarter of its workforce. The firm confirmed in a letter to its employees that it will axe 1,700 roles from a total 6,200 workers. The reorganisation is linked to its acquisition of SSE three years ago and the integration of the firm into Ovo. It is understood the cuts will be made through voluntary redundancy. Ovo has also told staff it will raise minimum pay across the firm to Â£12 an hour. In the letter, Adrian Letts, the boss of Ovo's retail business, told staff: ""Whilst it is regrettable to be reducing roles across the business and we understand this will be an uncertain time for many, we will fully support all our employees as this process develops over the coming months. ""We are engaging with our recognised trade unions to ensure all receive the right information and support."" Unite, the union, said ithad warned back in 2020 about the possible impact Ovo's takeover of SSE's retail business,externaland the possible impact on jobs. On Thursday, Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""We will do everything in our power to defend our members' jobs. ""We will not sit by and watch our members being made to pay the price of the pandemic."" Energy boss blames bad day for âridiculousâ advice Urgent action needed on energy prices - Ovo boss Ovo said that it will reduce the number of its offices from 10 to three in Bristol, Glasgow and London. It also said that ""more employees will also be supported to work flexibly from home should they wish"". The company added that it intends to ""reverse the policy of off-shoring from the previous owner and create more high-skilled jobs here in the UK"". Ovo took over SSE's household energy business in 2019. A spokesperson for Ovo declined to say how many roles the shift away from off-shoring would affect. Mr Letts said the changes ""will enable us to better serve our customers"". But Gary Carter, national officer at the GMB union, said: ""At a time when more than 20 energy companies have gone to the wall and customers are looking to other providers for their energy needs, this looks like the wrong time to cut jobs."" The energy sector has been struggling with higher wholesale gas prices since last September and the UK's price cap for households means firms have been unable to pass on the rising costs to retail customers. It has led to large numbers of smaller energy businesses going bust. Larger energy companies have taken on the customers from firms that have collapsed. It is the second time Ovo has announced major job cuts since the pandemic began. In May 2020, it reduced its headcount by 2,600 workers and closed offices, stating that Covid had led to more people paying their bills online. Most of the cuts came from the SSE business which Ovo bought for Â£500m, which added 3.5 million customers to its existing base of 1.5 million households. Mr Letts said that Ovo is shifting around 120,000 SSE customers a week onto its own operating platform which it said will ""significantly drive down costs and improve the customer experience"". Regardless of the price cap, households are set to see a significant rise in energy costs this year when the regulator Ofgem reviews the ceiling on gas and electricity bills. When a company cuts costs it is usually bad news for staff, but possibly of benefit to its customers. Reducing costs can lead to lower prices. Not this time. Household energy bills will rise, sharply, in April. Anyone on a variable or default tariff - or whose fixed deal is coming to an end - is highly likely to see their annual bill go up by hundreds of pounds owing to sky-high wholesale gas prices. The company has just apologised for suggesting customers do star jumps to keep warm. There certainly won't be any leaping for joy among staff and customers today. Ovo boss Stephen Fitzpatrick has been lobbying the government to help reduce a rise in bills which would come into force in April. He has said that the rise in wholesale gas prices and its impact on people will be ""an enormous crisis for 2022"". On Wednesday, he told the BBC: ""Unless the government comprehends how significant this is in the coming weeks, we're going to face a tragic situation where UK households cannot afford to heat their homes."" However, his company Ovo offered slightly more controversial guidance this week on how to cut bills to SSE Energy customers - suggesting they do ""a few star jumps"" or hug a pet ""to stay cosy"". Cats can double as a heating device, according to Ovo's - now deleted - advice for SSE customers Ovo was forced to apologise and Mr Fitzpatrickblamed a ""bad day"" for ""ridiculous"" adviceto customers on how to stay warm amid soaring energy bills. He said he was ""really embarrassed"" by the ""ridiculous"" advice emailed to customers on ""simple and cost-effective ways to keep warm this winter"". ""We're a large company and somebody had a bad day,"" he said. The guidance has since been removed from the website.

"Around 100 ex-British Council staff are still in Afghanistan despite the Taliban taking over the country Afghans who were employed to spread British values and teach English in Helmand province have told the BBC they are still in hiding from the Taliban and remain ""terrified of reprisals"". Around 100 ex-British Council staff are still in Afghanistan having so far been denied the right to come to the UK. ""We are all sitting inside, like in prison,"" one said, while another said they were now running out of money. The Foreign Office saida new scheme will bring thousands more to the UK. The teachers have been told they can apply for the new Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme. But many have been in hiding since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August. The British Council, a public body that works around the world to promote cultural and educational links, says the risk they now face is ""gravely evident"". ""We know our former colleagues are living in increasingly desperate circumstances, as the situation in the country continues to deteriorate,"" said Scott McDonald, the British Council's chief executive. He described the teachers as ""the face of the UK in Afghanistan"". ""Rahimallah"", a man in his 20s whose real name we are not using, spent two years working for the British Council in ""risky and dangerous"" circumstances in Helmand, where British troops were based until 2014. One of his tasks was to teach ""equality, diversity and inclusion"" to school teachers - often in the face of strong local opposition. Even many well-educated male teachers rejected the idea of gender equality, he said. ""We had to do it,"" he told the BBC. ""We told them that lesbians, gays and bisexuals have to be accepted in our Afghan communities, but they rejected it. They said that I was doing a job which was completely against Islamic values."" He remains in hiding - unable to work or see his family - and is convinced that, if the Taliban found him, he would be killed. ""A relative of mine posted on Facebook against the Taliban, saying that they could not pay teachers' salaries,"" he says. ""The next day, Taliban intelligence men abducted him, tortured him and killed him, and then threw his body in the Helmand River. Just for a Facebook post."" He added: ""I'm sure they will do the same with me.""

Another former teacher told the BBC: ""We are really depressed."" She has a young daughter who, she says, begs to be allowed outside. ""We are hiding and we cannot go out, we have to stay inside our house,"" she says. ""We move from place-to-place when we hear the Taliban are coming for searches."" Another teacher described going out of the house only every few weeks in disguise. Their cause has been taken up by their former boss, Joe Seaton, who says teachers began approaching him, begging for help. He has been critical of the British Council, which he left in 2020, after three-and-a-half years in Afghanistan. He says the organisation prioritised office staff in Kabul at the teachers' expense - a charge the British Council denies. He believes the teachers should have been eligible to come to the UK under a government scheme called ARAP, the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy, which was set up for locally employed staff at risk of reprisals.  But they've now been told to apply under a new scheme. This video can not be played Quentin Sommerville reports on the worsening food crisis in Afghanistan as winter starts to bite ""It was the UK government's foreign policy objective to counter violent extremism in Afghanistan and the programme they worked for was addressing this by mainstreaming equality, diversity and inclusion,"" he said. ""They were the boots on the ground for this."" The Foreign Office, which has been criticised for its handling of evacuations from Afghanistan, said: ""Last week, the government opened the Afghanistan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ARCS) which will give up to 20,000 people at risk a new life in the UK, including those British Council contractors who are most at risk."" The British Council insists it has not been involved in any decision-making.  ""When the ARAP scheme first opened, the UK government only considered applications from British Council employees, "" it said in a statement. ""This category included our office staff but not our contractors (which included our teachers.)"" It says it has been pushing the UK government to consider their applications as soon as possible. But after months in hiding the teachers themselves are running out of hope, as well as resources. ""I'm not sure I can do this for a long time,"" Rahimallah added.

"Gutierrez-Reed's claim states she remembers loading the gun with rounds labelled as dummy ammunition (stock image) The armourer in charge of weapons used during the filming of Rust has sued the prop supplier, alleging his company distributed ""a mix of dummy and live ammunition"" on set. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins wasfatally shot last yearwhen Alec Baldwin fired a gun during a rehearsal, after being told the firearm was safe. Armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed is seeking unspecified damages from Seth Kenney and PDQ Arm and Prop LLC. Kenney has not yet commented. But in December,he told Good Morning America,external: ""It's not possible that they [the live rounds] came from PDQ or myself personally."" Actor and producer Baldwin hasinsisted he ""didn't pull the trigger""andtold ABC News,externalin December: ""I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them, never."" Alec Baldwin says he did not fire the gun that killed Halyna Hutchins Gutierrez-Reed has filed her legal claim for an unspecified amount in New Mexico state court, the same state where the filming and fatal shooting in October took place. The film's director, Joel Souza, was also injured by the shooting. Court documents state Ms Gutierrez-Reed said police had discovered seven bullets suspected of being live after the shooting, according to AFP. It added that they were distributed among a box of cartridges with other ammunition and cartridge belts intended for the actors to use as accessories. What are prop guns and why are they dangerous? What are the rules for guns on film sets? Kenney and his company ""created a dangerous condition on the movie set, unbeknownst to Hannah Gutierrez Reed"", according to the armourer and her lawyer. Her claim states: ""The ammunition was misrepresented as only dummy ammunition when it contained both dummy and live ammunition. ""Defendants distributed boxes of ammunition purporting to contain dummy rounds but which contained a mix of dummy and live ammunition to the Rust production."" Police investigating the shooting have been attempting to get hold of Baldwin's phone, but despite getting a search warrant several weeks ago, they have been unable to obtain it. Halyna Hutchins was described by colleagues as ""an incredible artist"" The actor hashit back at suggestions that he is not complying, saying specifying exactly what is needed from the phone takes time. Gutierrez-Reed's claim states she remembers loading the gun with rounds labelled as dummy ammunition, and that she shook the box to create the jingling sound that the inert rounds should make. ""To the best of Hannah's knowledge, the gun was now loaded with six dummy rounds,"" the documents said. She said that Covid protocols kept her from entering the church where filming was taking place, so she had to give up control of the gun 15 minutes before the shooting. It was not captured on film as Baldwin was practising camera angles for a scene which would be filmed later.

"Flt Lt Stannard released the LauncherOne rocket high over the Pacific Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company launched another rocket to space on Thursday. The booster, carrying seven satellites, was sent skyward from a Jumbo Jet flying out over the Pacific Ocean. Playing a key role in the 747's cockpit was RAF fighter pilot Mathew Stannard, who is on secondment to the British entrepreneur's California firm. The UK Ministry of Defence anticipates using Virgin Orbit to launch military satellites in the future. The Flt Lt is gaining experience for when rocket missions start operating from British soil. This should happen later this year. Branson's rocket team go 'bonkers' with delight Lockheed selects rocket for Shetland launches UK science minister outlines British space strategy RAF pilot Mathew Stannard is on a three-year secondment with Virgin Orbit Thursday's ascent was Virgin Orbit's third straight success following an inaugural demonstration launch in May 2020 that didn't reach orbit. Prior to this mission, 19 satellites had been lofted. The seven on the latest manifest included one manufactured in Glasgow by Spire Global, which tracks weather conditions from orbit, along with ship and plane movements. The flight profile followed the familiar pattern. The jumbo, known as Cosmic Girl, left California's Mojave airport at 13:39 US West Coast time (21:39 GMT). The jet flew out over the Pacific with the rocket tucked neatly under its left wing. Just over an hour after take-off (14:52 PST), at an altitude of roughly 35,000ft (10km), Flt Lt Stannard unhooked the liquid-fuelled booster and let it go into a freefall. Four seconds later, as the 747 banked hard to the right, LauncherOne ignited its first-stage engine to begin the climb to orbit. All seven satellites were safely delivered to an orbit inclined 45 degrees to the equator. Virgin Orbit wants to run a total of six space missions this year, with two of these planned to operate out of Newquay Airport in Cornwall. The British government has made it a plank of its new space strategy to foster a launch industry from the UK. Congratulating Virgin Orbit on another successful mission, UK Space Agency Deputy CEO Ian Annett said: ""The UK is home to some of the world's leading satellite manufacturers, which currently ship their products overseas for launch. ""We are supporting them by fostering a new domestic launch market, with spaceports and launch operators providing services across the UK and catalysing investment from all over the world."" The flight of the LauncherOne vehicle lasted just under the hour The first UK launch by Virgin Orbit could happen as early as June or July, although much will depend on how quickly licensing paperwork goes through the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA's paramount concern is safety and it won't let any launch proceed until it's satisfied all contingencies are covered. The CAA has 35 staff to assess the technical details of applications. A licence to operate a spaceport is expected to take six to 12 months to process; a licence to operate a rocket system will take longer at nine to 18 months. The CAA told the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday that so far it was dealing with four formally submitted licensing applications (others from a range of potential spaceport/rocket operators are at a pre-application stage). However, when asked whether this meant a UK launch was likely this year, the authority's policy director Tim Johnson refused to be drawn. ""We absolutely share the government's enthusiasm, and industry's enthusiasm, and commitment to this task. We're open for business, we're processing applications; the key driver of the timetable will be the quality of the applications (and) the evidence presented,"" he told MPs. ""We will exercise our duties in the most timely way possible.""

"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is acting as lead negotiator for the first time since replacing Lord Frost The UK and EU have resumed talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol. The foreign secretary is acting as the UK's lead negotiatorfor the first time since Lord Frost resigned last month. ""There is a deal to be done but it will require a pragmatic approach from the EU,"" said Liz Truss. The UK is seeking fundamental changes to the operation and oversight of the protocol, while the EU has offered limited changes aimed at reducing the impact on Northern Ireland businesses. Ahead of the talks, which have been billed as a potential ""reset"", Ms Truss said the EU had ""a clear responsibility"" to fix problems. She added that she would put forward ""practical, reasonable solutionsâ¦ with a view to agreeing a plan for intensive negotiations"". The Northern Ireland Protocol creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. It was agreed by the EU and the UK government in October 2019. It also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for businesses. Unionist parties say this 'Irish Sea border' undermines Northern Ireland's position in the UK. The largest unionist party,the DUP, has threatened to withdraw from NI's devolved governmentif the protocol is not reformed. READ MORE:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The government has said the protocol is ""unbalanced"" which makes it practically and politically unsustainable. The major practical impact of the protocol is that all commercial goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain need a customs declaration, while food products are subject to additional controls and checks. TheUK has proposed,externalan arrangement where the assumption would be that most goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would be staying there and would not be at risk of crossing the border into Ireland and the wider EU. A simple self-certification process would mean that most goods wouldn't need to be checked or be subject to additional paperwork. The UK also wants to limit the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in any protocol disputes. Its preferred option is a new governance arrangement in which disputes would ultimately be resolved by an independent arbitrator. However, the government has indicated that it is open to discussing a role for the ECJ, which could draw on other EU agreements. Ms Truss has invited MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, the EU's chief negotiator, to Chevening, a 115-room grace-and-favour country mansion in Kent, for an overnight stay. The grounds boast a walled kitchen garden, lake and maze. Dinner will consist of Scottish smoked salmon, Welsh lamb and Kent apple pie. Previously Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost would shuttle between Brussels and London for relatively quick Friday catch-ups. Then the Covid situation deteriorated and their talks were downgraded to virtual chats. But the UK's new lead negotiator has markedly dumped that old format, for now. The idea to invite the European Commission vice-president to Chevening was, I'm told, absolutely her own. READ MORE:Truss pulling out all the stops in EU talks The EU acknowledges that the protocol is causing practical difficulties in Northern Ireland. It has proposed a package of measures, which it says will mitigate them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They include expanded trusted trader arrangements covering more products and companies. The EU says its new plan for food means that most products destined for Northern Ireland consumerswould not need to be physically checkedwhen arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ is the EU's chief negotiator A grace period, during which the protocol is not being fully implemented, currently means that supermarkets do not face a full range of controls. The EU says its proposals will go beyond this and cover more businesses. It claims the plans would halve customs paperwork and mean physical checks on goods would be about 80% lower than typically required at an EU border. The UK government and some Northern Ireland businesses are sceptical about those numbers. In December the EU also published a proposal which it said would guarantee the long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has been reluctant to engage on the issue of the ECJ, emphasising that it must be the ultimate arbiter of EU law. Article 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard"" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal. Lord Frost frequently threatened to use Article 16, something which the EU's chief negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ described as ""an enormously disruptive element in negotiations"". Liz Truss has reiterated that Article 16 remains an option for the UK. There are no hard legal deadlines but both sides have expressed a desire to make rapid progress in the next few weeks. Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has said the process cannot ""drift on for months"". He has suggested that the aim should be to conclude negotiations by the end of February, well ahead of the Northern Ireland Assembly election in May.

Today's live page was brought to you by Becky Morton, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chris Giles, Nathan Williams, Alexandra Fouche and Francesca Gillett, and edited by James Clarke, Emma Owen and Kevin Ponniah. We'll be closing our coverage for the day shortly, but here's a reminder of what's been happening on another eventful one. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played David explains how his daughter was dying, at the time of the Downing Street garden event. Boris Johnson yesterday admitted attending a Downing Street garden drinks event during lockdown - on 20 May 2020, when rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings. At the time Davidâs 25-year-old daughter was dying of a brain tumour. He contactedBBC Radio 5 Liveto explain how the lockdown restrictions at the time affected his family. âWe were told then that her tumour had started to grow, and we should prepare for the worst. Her sister couldnât even come to visit her to say goodbye,"" he says. âWe were trying our best to follow the rules in very difficult circumstances, but the government making these rules were just completely ignoring them.â In London, a man writes a message on the National Covid Memorial Wall. More than 150,000 people have now died with the virus in the UK A healthcare worker administers a dose of the Covid vaccine during a door-to-door vaccination campaign in a slum in Karachi, Pakistan A woman is tested for Covid as she arrives at the annual Gangasagar Fair for Hindu pilgrims in eastern India In Paris a woman holds a placard reading ""unmask my students"" as part of a nationwide day of strikes and protests by French teachers against the government's handling of the crisis. Paul Givan said an inquiry into the Downing Street drinks party must be completed quickly Northern Ireland's first ministersays he doubts the public accepts Boris Johnson's claimhe believed the No 10 party was a work event. Paul Givan also says it was right the prime minister gave an apology, but the PM will be ""tested"" by both the public and his own party. ""Either he takes a decision himself or it will be for the Conservative Party to decide his future,"" he says. Givan wants civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into gatherings to come to a conclusion soon to ""draw a line under this"" and ensure health messaging is ""consistent rather than distracted by what's going on in Downing Street"". Johnson admitted he'd joined colleagues for drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, to thank them for their hard work, but said he ""believed implicitly that this was a work event"". More now on President Bidenâs announcement to deploy military teams to states hit hard by Covid - weâve been examining why the Omicron variant has led to the US having a record number of patients with the virus in its hospitals. In many other countries, public health officials have noted the figure remains significantly lower than during previous pandemic surges. So why is the US different?  Read more on this storyhere. A medical worker about to enter a negative pressure room at a US hospital Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Cases are falling â
down nearly a quarter over the past week compared to the week before. But how much should
we read into this? These, after all, are only the people who come forward for
testing. We know there has
been huge demand on the testing system as cases have hit record levels with
some complaining they have not been able to get tests. With the exception
of Wales, none of the other UK nations count reinfections, which are becoming
increasingly common with the Omicron variant. But despite all
that the scale of the fall in detected cases clearly suggests infection levels
have turned a corner. Data from the
Office for National Statistics, which uses a random survey to estimate the true
infection levels in the population, suggests the rises were slowing up to last
weekend. We will have to
wait until next Wednesday to get figures for this week. But regardless of
that, admissions have already plateaued at just over 2,200 a day on average. The fact this has
happened so quickly â normally it takes 10 days for changes in infections to
filter through to hospital cases â is another illustration of just how
different this Omicron wave is. A man who was fined  Â£100 by police in March 2021 for having three friends in his garden on his birthday during lockdown says Boris Johnson has ""made fools of"" the public. Kieron McArdle tells the BBC the PM should resign over the May 2020 drinks party held in No 10, as it creates a perception of having ""one rule for them, one rule for us"". You can hear more about what happened to him below: This video can not be played Boris Johnson party row: Public 'made fools of' - man fined for gathering A cinema owner who admitted breaching Covid rules has been asked to clarify the grounds of an appeal. Cinema & Co owner Anna Redfern, 45,was given a suspended prison sentence and fined Â£15,000 in Decemberat Swansea Magistrates' Court. She has now lodged an appeal at the city's crown court. In November, Covid passes became a legal requirement in cinemas in Wales,but Redfern refused to enforce them, saying they were ""an infringement on our human rights"". At a hearing today, Judge Paul Thomas QC has said it was ""ambiguous"" whether the appeal is against the conviction or just the sentence. The court's also heard Redfern had called to say she was unable to attend as her mother was ""extremely ill"" and she was ""living off"" about Â£30,000 in savings, with the judge asking about any evidence she was receiving funds from an ""outside source"". Swansea council's prosecutor said Redfern had said she received about Â£55,000 from an online ""crowdfunder"". Read morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be
âcoincidentalâ Covid. Currently 190 people on average a day are dying within 28 days of a
positive test, up from 120 a month ago. But because of the rising numbers of cases weâve seen over
the past month, that figure is catching a growing number of people whose death
may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. About 2,000 people die in the UK each day in winter months
and some of them will, by coincidence, have tested positive recently. You might expect to see, very roughly, about 55 of these
âcoincidentalâ Covid deaths a day, based on the nearly 6% of people in the UK
who have tested positive in the past four weeks (mostly young people at lower
risk of dying). The rise in that figure over the past month would account for more than half of the rise weâve seen in Covid deaths. These coincidental deaths have always been a part of the
figures but become more of a problem for the daily count when thereâs lots of
coronavirus around. We can still get a good picture of the deaths caused by
Covid: doctors registering a death record what caused it. Data from those death registrations take longer to be
published but will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemicâs death
toll. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has on Thursday confirmed that cases of the Omicron variant have
reached a third Chinese city. Official media are reporting that a case of the variant has been
confirmed in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province. Over the last week, cases
have also been confirmed in Tianjin, and Anyang, Henan province. There have been 124 local cases of Covid-19 in China in the last
24 hours. Areas where Omicron has been detected are stepping up precautions in
an attempt to suppress further transmission. The Tianjin government has said it will ban vehicles going into
high-risk areas, even if they are visiting to deliver goods, and thatonly specialised personnel will be involved in this,external. Chinaâs Omicron outbreak comes just weeks beforethe 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is set to begin. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are
also set to travel in the next couple of weeks for the Lunar New Year. China has consistently credited its zero-Covid strategy - which
involves swift lockdowns and large-scale testing drives - for being able to
quash localised outbreaks. This video can not be played Prime minister's apology was 'heartfelt', says cabinet colleague The international trade secretary has backed Boris Johnson, saying he shouldn't resign. Anne-Marie Trevelyan says she was pleased the PM gave a ""heartfelt apology""for attending a party in Downing Street during lockdown. She tells Rajini Vaidyanathan his comments would be a ""reassurance"" for her constituents. Johnson has been driving an ""incredibly effective set of decisions through some incredibly hard times of the pandemic"", she says. But would she have attended the Downing Street party? Travel firms are delighted France has relaxed its travel rules for UK travellers - and they say bookings have jumped. Airline Jet2 says it's seen a ""sharp and immediate"" spike in bookings and searches for flights to French skiing destinations. And tour operator Tui says ski bookings doubled yesterday following reports the rules would change - and it was not alone. ""Bookings to France doubled yesterday even before the announcement and we would expect to see another very positive uptick now it's official,"" says Chris Logan, managing director of Crystal Ski Holidays. Brittany Ferries has also welcomed the change in rules, and Eurostar says it will ramp up the frequency of services in the coming weeks. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will send additional military medical teams to six states buckling under the current Covid-19 surge. Teams of doctors and nurses - a total of more than 120 military personnel - will arrive at medical facilities in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island, Biden has said in the past hour. ""Theyâre heroes, and Iâm grateful for what they do,"" he says. Acknowledging widespread frustration amid yet another Covid-19 wave, the US president again urges Americans to get vaccinated and boosted, calling it the first line of defence. Biden also announces his administration will buy another 500 million at-home Covid-19 tests, in addition to the 500 million already being procured. The White House will also be making high-quality masks available for free, he says, with further details coming next week. More now on the government's announcement it's cutting the minimum self-isolation period for those who test positive for Covid in England to five full days. People will be able to leave their home if they have negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Here's how the new system will work from Monday 17 January. The change is being made because UK Health Security Agency data shows two-thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by day five. Many people have been struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared with 120 million in November. The UK governmenthas published its official daily figures,,externalwhich show another 109.133 people have tested positive with Covid. A further 335 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. There are 19,721 people currently in hospital with Covid, the figures show. These three figures are all down on the previous day. The saga over Novak Djokovic's Australian visa has made headlines around the world since the tennis star was detained in Melbourne last week. The unvaccinated player claims he had been given a medical exemption to enter the country based on a positive Covid test in mid-December. A judge ruled he could stay and take part in the Australian Open, but the government is considering cancelling his visa again. Here we attempt to answer some of the main questions that remain surrounding the case, including whether he actually tested positive. You can see those questions and answers here. This video can not be played Prof Van-Tam uses football analogy to explain Covid timeline Jonathan Van-Tam's colourful analogies have turned the government medical adviser into something of a household name - and earned him praise for how he explains scientific concepts in layman's terms. A Boston United fan, he has often compared stages of the pandemic to a football match. Back in December 2020, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the UK, he said the country had scored an equaliser in the 70th minute, after getting ""an absolute battering"" in the first half. Almost a year later, when Omicron emerged, he said the new variant was like ""picking up a couple of yellow cards"" and everyone needed to ""up their game"" and get their booster. He's also compared the progress on the vaccine to landing a plane and waiting for a train. And explaining the complexities of the rollout, he once said the Pfizer vaccine was like a yoghurt - it can't be taken in and out of the fridge. You can read more of his memorable metaphors here. Poorer nations last month
rejected more than 100 million doses of Covid vaccines
distributed by the global programme Covax, mainly due to their
rapid expiry date, a Unicef official quoted by Reuters says. ""More than 100 million have been rejected just in December
alone,"" Etleva Kadilli, director of the supply division at the UN agency, tells the European Parliament. The main reason for rejection is the delivery of doses with
a short shelf life, she says. Poorer nations have also been forced to delay supplies
because they have insufficient storage facilities, including a lack of fridges for vaccines, she adds. Read more here about vaccinations and the Covax scheme. Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser says he is ""hopeful"" a corner has been turned with Omicron case numbers. Prof Ian Young adds he is now more concerned about hospital pressures during the current wave of Covid. He explains health service staff shortages remain significant with about 6 to 8% of hospital staff off with Covid - on top of absences for other health reasons or leave. There were 58 ""red flag"" cancer procedures cancelled during the first week of January, the latest figures show. Red flag cases can describe urgent and often live-saving procedures. Prof Young adds he hopes to see falling hospital numbers in the ""near future"", as the the NI executive has been meeting today to discuss the Covid situation. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"It couldn't have been a worse result for Prince Andrew. Just weeks ago, speculation was mounting that his team might have come up with a slam-dunk winner that would stop this case in its tracks. But, using another American sporting metaphor,Wednesday's resultshows it had all been a bit of a Hail Mary: a desperate last-minute attempt to reverse the result that was doomed to fail. In46 pages,,externalJudge Lewis Kaplan not only dismissed the attempts to stop Virginia Giuffre's civil damages claim against the Duke of York, he also underlined that many of the arguments had been worthless. Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre's case should be stopped for the following reasons: Her 2009 settlement with Jeffrey Epstein barred her from suing anyone else Her allegations were basically vague His rights as a defendant were being breached Let's look at those in turn. For months, we've heard from Prince Andrew's side that the previouslyconfidential settlementbetween convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ms Giuffre was a trump card. In that agreement she agreed not to bring any future cases against other ""potential defendants"". And so Prince Andrew's team argued that he could have been a ""potential defendant"". But nobody really knows - because Judge Kaplan said that the law prevents him from speculating what Epstein and Ms Giuffre intended when they signed up to those words. He said that the phrase ""potential defendants"" could literally mean anybody at all. The settlement did not clearly and unambiguously show that both parties wanted Prince Andrew to benefit from it. The prince's lawyers presented the judge with examples from other cases that they said showed he had a right to benefit from the deal as an affected third party. But Judge Kaplan was so unimpressed he declared they had been ""of no assistance"". That's basically judge talk for a waste of his time. Andrew to face civil sex assault case, judge rules Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? What are the accusations against Prince Andrew? Andrew accuserâs 2009 deal with Epstein published The prince's lawyers have argued that the substance ofMs Giuffre's allegationsdo not amount to a violation of New York law. But Judge Kaplan said that all Ms Giuffre has to show at this early stage of the case is that her complaint was plausible. ""The allegation that [Ms Giuffre] was forced to sit on [Prince Andrew's] lap while he touched her is sufficient to state a battery claim under New York law, regardless of which part of her body the defendant ultimately is alleged to have touched,"" ruled Judge Kaplan. ""[Bodily] contact is offensive if it is wrongful under all the circumstances, which certainly is a reasonable inference from Ms Giuffre's allegations. ""Ms Giuffre's complaint is neither unintelligible, nor vague nor ambiguous, It alleges discrete incidents of sexual abuse in particular circumstances at three identifiable locations,"" he said. ""While [Prince Andrew] understandably seeks more detail... he will be able to obtain that detail during pretrial discovery."" That's a reference to the case's next phase, which I explain below. As for a complaint that her allegations duplicated each other, Judge Kaplan said they were sufficiently different - and it would be for a jury to decide how they overlap and what that would mean for any potential damages. Lawyers for the prince had also argued that the New York Child Victims Act - the law Ms Giuffre is using to bring the two-decades-old allegations - is unconstitutional because it allowed her to revive allegations that would otherwise be too late to bring to a court. But Judge Kaplan said that argument had been tried before - and thrown out by every New York and federal court to have heard it. Well, firstly, case number ""1:21-cv-06702"" now appears unstoppable because the judge has set a clear timetable. In the coming days, the court may have to consider sending letters on behalf of Ms Giuffre to the British courts if it needs their assistance in gathering evidence. This is not unusual - it's part and parcel of transatlantic actions. Then, by the middle of May, both sides must declare their witnesses. At the same time, they must get on with providing evidence to each other. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies in 2019 Ms Giuffre wants proof that Prince Andrew could not sweat at the time when she says they met. She wants proof of his now world-famous night out in Woking's Pizza Express. His lawyers will want her evidence on where she actually lives. They may try to argue later that the case must stop because she lives in Australia and has no legal connection to the US. By 14 July, Judge Kaplan wants all evidence exchanged and ""deposition"" to be completed. That means the witnesses' evidence taken by lawyers and recorded for use in court later on. That means both the prince and Ms Giuffre putting their accounts on the record. He will face incredibly personal questions - as will she. And perhaps others will too. He could try to appeal against the ruling - but that's by no means guaranteed. If it were accepted by the higher court, that would naturally delay things. If Prince Andrew does not appeal and fails to co-operate with the timetable and exchange of evidence, Ms Giuffre can apply for an automatic judgement in her favour. So, assuming the appeal route doesn't materialise, he has a simple choice: he either has to take part, prepare to give his side of the story and have it defended one way or another in court - or he has to settle. There is, of course, legal risk for Ms Giuffre too. The burden is on her to prove her case. And the closer a case gets to trial, the bigger the financial risks become for a claimant because it just gets more and more expensive. Her lawyer David Boies says justice would include some form of recognition from the prince of his actions - but he has always denied the allegations. So the question now is this: if the prince's team make her a cash offer, will she accept it?

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 A lawyer for the woman accusing the Duke of York of sexually assaulting her at 17 says a money settlement alone will not be enough for his client. Prince Andrew faces a civil case in the US after Virginia Giuffre sued him, claiming he abused her in 2001. He has consistently denied the claims. A judge has ruledthe case can continueafter Prince Andrew tried to have it dismissed. David Boies, Ms Giuffre's lawyer, told the BBC she wants to be vindicated. Prince Andrew's lawyers had cited a 2009 deal Ms Giuffre signed with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as grounds for the dismissal of the case, arguing she had waived her right to pursue a claim against the royal. But Judge Lewis A Kaplan said the case could continue, adding that this ruling did not determine the ""truth or falsity"" of Ms Giuffre's complaint. The case against Prince Andrew, 61, could now be heard in court later this year. Mr Boies told BBC's Newsnight the ruling was ""an important step"" in moving towards a trial. What's next for Prince Andrew? What are the accusations against Prince Andrew? Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? Prince's TV interview now critical to case He said: ""I think it's very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims. I don't think she has a firm view as to exactly what a solution should be. ""But I think what's going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she has made."" In court documents, Ms Giuffre said she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by late billionaire financier Epstein. Part of her abuse involved being lent out to other powerful men, she alleges. Ms Giuffre's lawsuit alleges she suffered ""significant emotional and psychological distress"" Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, said in an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, and her account of them having sex in the US and UK ""didn't happen"". Asked if Ms Giuffre would be open to an out-of-court money settlement, her lawyer said he did not want to ""pre-judge that"", adding there had been ""no suggestion of settlement discussions at this point"". ""A purely financial settlement is not anything I think she is interested in,"" he said. Ms Giuffre filed a civil case in New York in August 2021 under the state's Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed. Now 38, she says the three alleged instances of abuse by Prince Andrew continue to cause her ""significant emotional and psychological distress and harm"". On Thursday, a letter was released signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking  the Queen to strip Prince Andrew of his ranks and titles in the British armed forces. In the joint letter, released by anti-monarchy pressure group Republic, they wrote: ""Were this any other senior military officer it is inconceivable that he would still be in post."" Prince Andrew's lawyers could potentially launch an appeal against Judge Kaplan's decision Prince Andrew withdrew from public duties soon after his 2019 appearance on Newsnight. He used the interview to reiterate his denials of Ms Giuffre's claims and explain his one-time friendship with Epstein and the late financier's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. One of Ms Giuffre's allegations is that Prince Andrew abused her at the London home of Maxwell, whoin December was convicted by a juryin New York of procuring teenage girls for Epstein. Prince Andrew's lawyers could potentially launch an appeal against Judge Kaplan's decision - although they would need his permission to do so, and legal commentators say the wording of his decision suggests it would not be granted.

Cinema & Co owner Anna Redfern, 45,was given a suspended prison sentence and fined Â£15,000 in Decemberat Swansea Magistrates' Court. She has now lodged an appeal at the city's crown court. In November, Covid passes became a legal requirement in cinemas in Wales,but Redfern refused to enforce them, saying they were ""an infringement on our human rights"". At a hearing today, Judge Paul Thomas QC has said it was ""ambiguous"" whether the appeal is against the conviction or just the sentence. The court's also heard Redfern had called to say she was unable to attend as her mother was ""extremely ill"" and she was ""living off"" about Â£30,000 in savings, with the judge asking about any evidence she was receiving funds from an ""outside source"". Swansea council's prosecutor said Redfern had said she received about Â£55,000 from an online ""crowdfunder"". Read morehere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Most of the recent increase in Covid deaths could be
âcoincidentalâ Covid. Currently 190 people on average a day are dying within 28 days of a
positive test, up from 120 a month ago. But because of the rising numbers of cases weâve seen over
the past month, that figure is catching a growing number of people whose death
may have had nothing to do with coronavirus. About 2,000 people die in the UK each day in winter months
and some of them will, by coincidence, have tested positive recently. You might expect to see, very roughly, about 55 of these
âcoincidentalâ Covid deaths a day, based on the nearly 6% of people in the UK
who have tested positive in the past four weeks (mostly young people at lower
risk of dying). The rise in that figure over the past month would account for more than half of the rise weâve seen in Covid deaths. These coincidental deaths have always been a part of the
figures but become more of a problem for the daily count when thereâs lots of
coronavirus around. We can still get a good picture of the deaths caused by
Covid: doctors registering a death record what caused it. Data from those death registrations take longer to be
published but will increasingly become our best picture of the pandemicâs death
toll. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has on Thursday confirmed that cases of the Omicron variant have
reached a third Chinese city. Official media are reporting that a case of the variant has been
confirmed in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province. Over the last week, cases
have also been confirmed in Tianjin, and Anyang, Henan province. There have been 124 local cases of Covid-19 in China in the last
24 hours. Areas where Omicron has been detected are stepping up precautions in
an attempt to suppress further transmission. The Tianjin government has said it will ban vehicles going into
high-risk areas, even if they are visiting to deliver goods, and thatonly specialised personnel will be involved in this,external. Chinaâs Omicron outbreak comes just weeks beforethe 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is set to begin. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are
also set to travel in the next couple of weeks for the Lunar New Year. China has consistently credited its zero-Covid strategy - which
involves swift lockdowns and large-scale testing drives - for being able to
quash localised outbreaks. This video can not be played Prime minister's apology was 'heartfelt', says cabinet colleague The international trade secretary has backed Boris Johnson, saying he shouldn't resign. Anne-Marie Trevelyan says she was pleased the PM gave a ""heartfelt apology""for attending a party in Downing Street during lockdown. She tells Rajini Vaidyanathan his comments would be a ""reassurance"" for her constituents. Johnson has been driving an ""incredibly effective set of decisions through some incredibly hard times of the pandemic"", she says. But would she have attended the Downing Street party? Travel firms are delighted France has relaxed its travel rules for UK travellers - and they say bookings have jumped. Airline Jet2 says it's seen a ""sharp and immediate"" spike in bookings and searches for flights to French skiing destinations. And tour operator Tui says ski bookings doubled yesterday following reports the rules would change - and it was not alone. ""Bookings to France doubled yesterday even before the announcement and we would expect to see another very positive uptick now it's official,"" says Chris Logan, managing director of Crystal Ski Holidays. Brittany Ferries has also welcomed the change in rules, and Eurostar says it will ramp up the frequency of services in the coming weeks. Read more here. US President Joe Biden will send additional military medical teams to six states buckling under the current Covid-19 surge. Teams of doctors and nurses - a total of more than 120 military personnel - will arrive at medical facilities in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island, Biden has said in the past hour. ""Theyâre heroes, and Iâm grateful for what they do,"" he says. Acknowledging widespread frustration amid yet another Covid-19 wave, the US president again urges Americans to get vaccinated and boosted, calling it the first line of defence. Biden also announces his administration will buy another 500 million at-home Covid-19 tests, in addition to the 500 million already being procured. The White House will also be making high-quality masks available for free, he says, with further details coming next week. More now on the government's announcement it's cutting the minimum self-isolation period for those who test positive for Covid in England to five full days. People will be able to leave their home if they have negative lateral flow tests on days five and six. Here's how the new system will work from Monday 17 January. The change is being made because UK Health Security Agency data shows two-thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by day five. Many people have been struggling to get hold of tests due to high demand. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs supplies had risen sharply from pre-Omicron levels, with 400 million available in January, compared with 120 million in November. The UK governmenthas published its official daily figures,,externalwhich show another 109.133 people have tested positive with Covid. A further 335 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. There are 19,721 people currently in hospital with Covid, the figures show. These three figures are all down on the previous day. The saga over Novak Djokovic's Australian visa has made headlines around the world since the tennis star was detained in Melbourne last week. The unvaccinated player claims he had been given a medical exemption to enter the country based on a positive Covid test in mid-December. A judge ruled he could stay and take part in the Australian Open, but the government is considering cancelling his visa again. Here we attempt to answer some of the main questions that remain surrounding the case, including whether he actually tested positive. You can see those questions and answers here. This video can not be played Prof Van-Tam uses football analogy to explain Covid timeline Jonathan Van-Tam's colourful analogies have turned the government medical adviser into something of a household name - and earned him praise for how he explains scientific concepts in layman's terms. A Boston United fan, he has often compared stages of the pandemic to a football match. Back in December 2020, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the UK, he said the country had scored an equaliser in the 70th minute, after getting ""an absolute battering"" in the first half. Almost a year later, when Omicron emerged, he said the new variant was like ""picking up a couple of yellow cards"" and everyone needed to ""up their game"" and get their booster. He's also compared the progress on the vaccine to landing a plane and waiting for a train. And explaining the complexities of the rollout, he once said the Pfizer vaccine was like a yoghurt - it can't be taken in and out of the fridge. You can read more of his memorable metaphors here. Poorer nations last month
rejected more than 100 million doses of Covid vaccines
distributed by the global programme Covax, mainly due to their
rapid expiry date, a Unicef official quoted by Reuters says. ""More than 100 million have been rejected just in December
alone,"" Etleva Kadilli, director of the supply division at the UN agency, tells the European Parliament. The main reason for rejection is the delivery of doses with
a short shelf life, she says. Poorer nations have also been forced to delay supplies
because they have insufficient storage facilities, including a lack of fridges for vaccines, she adds. Read more here about vaccinations and the Covax scheme. Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser says he is ""hopeful"" a corner has been turned with Omicron case numbers. Prof Ian Young adds he is now more concerned about hospital pressures during the current wave of Covid. He explains health service staff shortages remain significant with about 6 to 8% of hospital staff off with Covid - on top of absences for other health reasons or leave. There were 58 ""red flag"" cancer procedures cancelled during the first week of January, the latest figures show. Red flag cases can describe urgent and often live-saving procedures. Prof Young adds he hopes to see falling hospital numbers in the ""near future"", as the the NI executive has been meeting today to discuss the Covid situation. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Raw sewage, microplastics and slurry are coursing through all of England's rivers, putting health and nature at risk, a parliamentary report concludes. Agriculture and water companies are the biggest contributors to this ""chemical cocktail"", the Environmental Audit Committee warns. Car tyre particles, oils and wet wipes are also clogging waterways. The environment minister saidthe report,externalhighlighted areas the government was currently tackling. How clean are the UK's rivers and lakes? River Severn swimmer hospitalised after 'swallowing sewage' People across the country using rivers for activities ranging from sports and swimming to fishing risk falling ill from bacteria in sewage and slurry. The water and riverbanks are also home to rich plant, fish and insect life and are essential to biodiversity. But chemicals, plastics and an excess of nutrients are choking the water. No river in England can be given a clean bill of health, the group of MPs on the committee concluded after months of hearing from experts. Budget cuts are hampering the Environment Agency's ability to stop pollution, says the report. ""Rivers are the arteries of nature and must be protected. Our inquiry has uncovered multiple failures in the monitoring, governance and enforcement on water quality,"" Environmental Audit Committee chairman and MP Philip Dunne said. ""For too long, the government, regulators and the water industry have allowed a Victorian sewerage system to buckle under increasing pressure."" Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: ""We are going further and faster than any other government to protect and enhance the health of our rivers and seas. ""We welcome the Environmental Audit Committee's report which highlights many areas that this government is now tackling."" What a damning finding: every single river in England is contaminated with a cocktail of chemicals, according to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC). No surprise then that the committee's report is so critical of virtually everyone involved in managing the country's rivers. But don't assume that will prompt a sudden flurry of parliamentary or regulatory activity. The EAC has an unusually wide remit for a select committee. It can summon witnesses and request government papers to investigate environmental protection and sustainable development across all government departments. What it can't do is force the government to act on its reports or push its recommendations through Parliament. The committee's main power is to draw attention to any failures or shortcomings.  So the hope will be this report shames the government and its regulatory agencies into raising their game on river pollution. What it can't guarantee is that your local river will actually be cleaned up any time soon. The report makes a series of recommendations to overhaul how the country's rivers are managed. Water companies should be penalised more heavily for sewage discharge and each river should have a designated bathing area by 2025, it suggests. Pollution from intensive farming, in particular from chicken farms, is the most common way rivers are being contaminated, the report says. Excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen leaked into water cause algae to bloom to high levels in water - that's the cause of the thick, bright green layer often seen coating waterways. This can prevent oxygen entering the water, suffocating life beneath the surface. Water pollution causing 'death by a thousand cuts' for rivers Sewage discharged into rivers 400,000 times in 2020 Oils and fats poured down sinks in homes and restaurants is adding to the huge numbers of hygiene items like wet wipes that make their way into waterways. ""Fatbergs"" as big as blue whales have been removed from sewers in cities across England, costing companies and customers around Â£100 million a year, the report noted. 'Fatbergs' made up largely of household products and oils clog sewers at huge cost The committee is calling on the government to ban single use cleaning and hygiene products containing plastics. It also said that poor governance, monitoring and chronic underinvestment in the Environment Agency were a major contributor to the poor state of rivers. The reports singles out Wales and south-west Midlands where the waste from 20 million chickens may be raising the River Wye's phosphorus levels. The committee recommends that new poultry farms should not be permitted in areas where rivers have excess levels of nutrients. Andrew Rumming, a beef farmer at Waterhays farm in Wiltshire, said that it's bad socially, economically and environmentally for agriculture to pollute water courses, calling it ""unacceptable"". He said high demand for cheap chicken was partly to blame. ""It's vital that future farming schemes enable farmers to invest in new technology and infrastructure to tackle potential pollution issues,"" the National Farmers Union (NFU) said. The report says water companies are second only to agriculture in polluting rivers. They regularly discharge raw sewage into rivers and fail to disclose overflows, it says. Algal blooms may be green, blue-green or greenish brown Dumping sewage into rivers is only allowed in exceptional circumstances. Visual evidence of these spills include faeces, tampons and toilet rolls floating on water surfaces or caught in plants. The committee highlighted that community groups often report sewage overflow incidents that are not disclosed by water companies to the Environment Agency - suggesting the problem is much more widespread. The report says that how companies self-monitor must be urgently reviewed. A Water UK spokesperson commented: ""We support the committee's urgent call for action to improve the health of England's rivers. ""Many of the recommendations mirror proposals set out in our recent 21st Century Rivers report, which calls for government, regulators, water companies, agriculture, and other sectors to come together and create a comprehensive national plan to transform our rivers."" How we behave at home and outside also plays a role. Microplastics worn away from car tyres and brakes are being washed from busy roads into rivers - the committee said National Highways and the Environment Agency are not doing enough to prevent this pollution. Environmental issues are devolved but a UK-wide survey of river quality has been recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee because the same problems are likely to be occurring in Scotland and Wales.

"Kim Kardashian is among three celebrities being sued by investors in the EthereumMax crypto-currency. Other defendants include boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce, and the currency's creators. The legal action alleges,externalthe celebrities collaborated with EthereumMax to ""misleadingly promote and sell"" the crypto-currency. EthereumMax said it disputed the allegations and looked forward to the truth coming out. In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum crypto-currency. The class action claims EthereumMax operated a ""pump and dump"" scheme - where misleading marketing is used to inflate the price of an asset then sold to unwitting investors at a profit. The complaint filed with the Central District Court of California alleges the ""company's executives, collaborating with several celebrity promotors"" made ""false or misleading statements to investors about EthereumMax, through social-media advertisements and other promotional activities"". The defendants ""touted"" the ability of ""investors to make significant returns"", it alleges, resulting in an artificial increase in the price of the crypto-currency, ""causing investors to purchase these losing investments at inflated prices"" and, in turn, enabling the executive staff of EthereumMax named in the legal action to ""sell their EMax tokens to investors for a profit"". ""In plain terms, EthereumMax's entire business model relies on using constant marketing and promotional activities, often from 'trusted' celebrities, to dupe potential investors into trusting the financial opportunities,"" the court filing alleges. It alleges former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Mr Pierce promoted EthereumMax in a ""widely discussed"" post on Twitter, in May 2021, ""praising EthereumMax's ability to make money for him"". At the same time, EthereumMax started to use former world champion Mr Mayweather's boxing match with YouTuber Logan Paul to promote the crypto-currency. Mr Mayweather is said to have also promoted EthereumMax at a crypto-currency conference. Finally, reality-TV personality Kim Kardashian, the complaint alleges, published an Instagram post, saying: ""This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends tell me about the EthereumMax token."" The head of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, Charles Randell,later saidMs Kardashian had ""asked her 250 million followers to speculate on crypto tokens"", suggesting the post - marked as a an advert - may have been the ""financial promotion with the single biggest audience reach in history"". At the time, EthereumMax told BBC News its marketing and public-relations efforts ""are always from an awareness perspective and not encouraging to purchase - as the Kim K post was simply intended to raise awareness of the project and its utility"". ""It is our intention that our marketing and PR efforts encourage people to research our project... before making a decision,"" it said. ""This approach takes a lot of time, energy, and resources and is in stark contrast to the quick pump-and-dump schemes out there."" However, such promotion caused the currency to increase in value to over 1,300% more than its initial price before plummeting to ""an all-time low"" just over a month after Ms Kardashian's post, the court filing alleges, enabling defendants to ""offload"" EthereumMax tokens ""for substantial profits"" while many of those who purchased currency during this period lost out. The claim names as plaintiffs in the case those who invested between 14 May and 27 June 2021 and were ""damaged thereby"". EthereumMax denied the claims. Steve Gentile, identified in the filing as the ""co-founder/creator of EthereumMax"", told BBC News: ""The deceptive narrative associated with the recent allegations is riddled with misinformation about the EthereumMax project. ""We dispute the allegations and look forward to the truth coming out."" BBC News has sought comment from Ms Kardashian, Mr Mayweather and Mr Pierce.
