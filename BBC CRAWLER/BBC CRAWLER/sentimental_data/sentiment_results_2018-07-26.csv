"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces The UK has suspended co-operation with the US over two Islamic State suspects. Ministers had saidthey would share intelligence with the US that could lead to the men's conviction, without opposing a death penalty sentence. However the mother of one of the men has now launched a legal challenge to prevent such information sharing. The Home Office has halted co-operation until a judge has had a chance to consider an application for judicial review. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, both of whom have been stripped of British nationality, are wanted for being part of the IS kidnap gang behind hostage executions. They are accused of being the last two members of an IS group dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents. Lawyers for the mother of El Shafee Elsheikh have now prepared detailed grounds challenging Mr Javid's decision to share information with the US without a death penalty assurance - meaning a case could be before High Court judges in days. They said the home secretary's actions revealed ""a clear and dramatic departure from the UK's long standing international and domestic commitment to oppose the continuing exercise of the death penalty."" A Home Office spokesperson said the government had ""agreed to a short-term pause"" but was confident it had ""acted in full accordance of the law"". What is behind Britain's IS duo decision? Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? The two men are currently being held by Kurdish forces and the UK believes it cannot legally extradite them to face trial here. This week it emerged that the US was preparing the ground to prosecute the men itself - and that it had asked the UK for information that would help convict them. In a letter leaked tothe Daily Telegraph,external, Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote that the UK would not oppose the use of the death penalty if the two men were extradited to the US. In the past Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects. Number 10 had said this was ""a long-standing position"" to oppose the death penalty but added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"". Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The home secretary's position boils down to a simple question: Would you run the risk of them going free? Given Elsheikh and Kotey are in the custody of Syrian Kurdish forces, that sounds unlikely. But British prosecutors can't bring the men for trial here because they're not being held by a recognised state with whom the UK has a legally recognised extradition agreement - it would amount to kidnap. The forces holding the men are, however, backed by the US - and American courts are less fussy about the legalities of how a suspect ends up in the dock. The US may need British information to make a prosecution stick - hence the co-operation. This challenge from Mr Elsheikh's mother isn't about that evidence - but whether the ministerial decision to share it demolishes the UK's internationally recognised opposition to capital punishment. In case after case down the years, the UK has refused to provide legal help that could lead to overseas executions. So this decision to help the Americans, made in the hope of landing a conviction of two of the most wanted men in the world, could turn into a major legal fight. Labour accused the UK of having ""unilaterally abandoned"" its opposition to the death penalty. The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile said this constituted ""a unilateral change of policy without any consultation"". Left to right: Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official told him that this case was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used. But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence.

"This video can not be played BBC Weather forecast for the rest of the week - thunderstorms ahead It is officially the hottest day of the year so far in the UK with temperatures soaring to 35.1C in Surrey. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales saw high temperatures of 26.2-29.4C. The Met Office says temperatures will keep rising into Friday and the UK's all-time temperature record of 38.5C (101F) - set in Kent in August 2003 -  could be beaten. But parts of England are experiencing heavy rainfall and thunderstorm warnings are in place. Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands' Heat brings five-hour Channel Tunnel delays How long will it last? Your heatwave questions The maximum temperature in Wales was 29.4C in Usk and for Northern Ireland, 26.2C at Giants Causeway. The highest temperature recorded in Scotland was 27.6C in Dunstaffnage. Temperatures of 37C (99F) have been forecast in southern, eastern and central England for Friday. The July record for the highest overnight minimum temperature is 23.3C - and the Met Office says that could be surpassed in south-east England on Thursday. The UK's current all-time record temperature for July stands at 36.7C, which was recorded at Heathrow in July 2015. A Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms is in place in the East and West Midlands, the East of England, London and the South East, and Yorkshire until 21:00 BST on Thursday.

High temperatures have been blamed for delays to cross-Channel rail services of up to five hours. Eurotunnel said air conditioning problems meant some carriages could not be used, which led to the delays. It added that queues formed on the UK side because of the sheer number of France-bound passengers at the start of the summer getaway. The RAC said it was expecting breakdowns to be about 15-20% higher than they would normally expect for late July, adding that breakdowns were already up 25% in London. The scene was described on social media as ""boarding chaos"" Meanwhile, London's fire chief has called for barbecue bans to be imposed in the capital's parks after a record-breaking number of grass fires. London Fire Brigade's Commissioner Dany Cotton urged all borough councils to impose a temporary ban in the ""tinder dry capital"" as it was ""only a matter of time"" before someone was seriously hurt. There have already been 43 large grass fires in London so far this year, compared to seven in the whole of 2017.

Young people, the elderly and those with lung or heart problems were advised to reduce strenuous exercise and physical exertion. How hot is it where you are? Are your work clothes making you hotter? Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Hospitals, too, have been affected by the heat. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said high temperatures were leaving nurses dizzy and exhausted. One nurse was admitted to A&E with dehydration after working three 12-hours shifts in a row during the heatwave. Kim Sun-Lee, national officer at the RCN, said:  ""It is vital employers adapt working practices to the heat - both patients and nurses must have easy access to water, and all healthcare staff should be able to take regular breaks, preferably somewhere cool."" People cool off at the bathing pond on Hampstead Heath, London Others try to stay out of the sun, like this man on Brighton beach NHS Providers - the trade body which represents NHS services - said some hospitals were back to ""winter conditions"" after reporting record numbers of A&E admissions.

"Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Jack Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat A man has been found guilty of killing a woman in a speedboat crash on the River Thames during their first date. Jack Shepherd, 30, and Charlotte Brown, 24, were thrown overboard from the boat, which had a series of defects, in December 2015. Shepherd, who was absent during his Old Bailey trial, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence. The jury heard Shepherd, who is on the run after skipping bail, bought the boat ""to pull women"". Jack Shepherd pictured during his police interview Shepherd, of Paddington, will be sentenced on Friday. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. The court heard he met Ms Brown on dating website OkCupid and tried to impress her with a boat trip past the Houses of Parliament after a meal at The Shard. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error But their champagne-fuelled first date ended in tragedy when his boat capsized and she was thrown into the river near Wandsworth Bridge. The court had heard how Shepherd had entertained up to 10 women on the 1980s boat that he bought from Gumtree, having invited them back to his houseboat in Hammersmith. The boat was taken to the Old Bailey car park to be inspected by jurors during the trial In mobile phone footage filmed during the date, Ms Brown could be heard shouting that they were going ""so fast"" as Shepherd drove at more than double the 12 knot speed limit. On the return journey, Shepherd handed over the controls to Ms Brown who followed suit and went ""full throttle"". The speeding boat hit a submerged log and tipped over, sending both of them into the Thames. A warrant has been issued for Jack Shepherd's arrest Shepherd was found clinging to the hull and Ms Brown, from Clacton, Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found that Ms Brown died from cold water immersion. Riverside resident Steven Morrissey told the court that he heard a young man screaming for help. He said in a statement: ""He kept saying 'Help me, help me, somebody help me'. It was just 'Help me"" - not 'us', or 'her'."" Speedboat taken to Old Bailey as evidence Boat death accused 'wanted to show off' Man's boat 'seduction routine' went wrong In a statement read outside the Old Bailey, Ms Brown's sister Katie appealed for Shepherd to return from ""wherever he may be"" and ""take responsibility for the devastation he has caused our family"". ""We cannot allow Charli's passing to be in vain - her legacy will be to highlight the appalling lack of legislation and safety measures on our waterways. ""Charli died because she thought she would be safe taking a journey on Jack's speedboat - a speedboat we now know that was unsafe and that he bought with sole purpose of seducing young women."" This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie (middle) appealed for Shepherd to ""take responsibility for the devastation he has caused our family"" The court heard the boat had a number of defects, including faulty steering. Life jackets had been tucked away and the kill cord was not connected. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors: ""It was cold, it was dark; we submit it was sheer madness."" Jurors were told Shepherd denied manslaughter on the basis he had no ""duty of care"" towards Ms Brown. CCTV footage showed the boat after it had hit a submerged log and tipped over Shepherd told his lawyers in mid-May he would not attend his trial but the Crown Prosecution Service only found out a week before proceedings began. Prosecutors said police had spoken to his mother on 27 June and were told he had not been in contact since March and his phone number was no longer connected. His defence team insisted they did not know where he was, even though his solicitor had maintained telephone contact.

"Michael Simpson with his children Alice and Jack Two young children are living in a rural town in China, completely unaware that their British father is dead after being murdered by their Chinese mother. Seven-year-old Jack and his six-year-old sister Alice are also unaware they are now at the centre of an increasingly bitter custody battle between their British and Chinese grandparents. Now sharing a bedroom with their cousin, they were taken to live in Nanzhang after their mother Weiwei Fu was jailed for life earlier this month. The children's father, Michael Simpson, originally from Wimborne, Dorset, was 34 whenhe was stabbed to death by his estranged wifeat his apartment in Shanghai in March 2017. The couple had met and married after he moved to China to work in the supply business of the British retailer Next. They had been living separately for a year and Michael's family say the children spent most of their time with their father. Now his parents, Ian and Linda, want the children to live with them in the UK, where they say they will have a better life and education. They have promised to maintain contact with the Chinese family, keep teaching the children Mandarin and visit annually. ""Losing Michael put a hole in our family,"" Mr Simpson says. ""If you take away the children as well you've basically blotted out the whole of that family."" Ian Simpson with his grandson Jack Having sat through the trial and sentencing, the couple had hoped to reach a deal with the Chinese family. They were prepared to forgo their claim for compensation, offer some money instead to the relatives who are looking after the children and, crucially, offer official ""forgiveness"". The latter could have seen Weiwei Fu's sentence cut in half, all in exchange for custody of Jack and Alice. But no deal was done. The Fu family ""won't let us see them... and won't negotiate with us at all"", Mr Simpson says. The Simpsons blame Weiwei's brother and have accused him of extortion. They say he met with their lawyer just before the sentencing and repeated a demand for a payment of just over Â£60,000 in exchange for the children. ""I couldn't believe they would let their daughter go to jail for so long, just for the sake of that,"" Mr Simpson says. The Chinese family denies it is using the children to extort money from their other grandparents. The Foreign Office has been assisting the Simpsons as they pursue a custody case in the Chinese courts, but members of the family have said in the past they've felt ""let down"" by British officials. They now think political intervention is needed and, as Jeremy Hunt prepares to visit China this weekend, they want the new foreign secretary to intervene in the case and appeal to Chinese officials for help. The Simpson family say they are ""fairly impressed"" with the Chinese judiciary system, although they have concerns as the custody hearing will be in a local court near where the children are currently living. They fear they may not be treated fairly saying some courts ""seem a bit timid"" about hearing cases involving foreigners. The Foreign Office has promised to write to the court and send a representative to the hearing, which is due soon. But the family want more direct intervention. ""We do want political support,"" Mr Simpson says. The BBC understands the case was mentioned in meetings by the UK's national security adviser, Sir Mark Sedwill, when he was in China ahead of the prime minister's trip earlier this year. When asked if he had forgiven his daughter-in-law for murdering his son, Ian Simpson said: ""I have no hatred towards her. To be honest I probably have more hatred towards the family. ""She's a bit like nothing to me,"" he added. ""I don't have any real feelings towards her. Do I forgive her? No."" Man 'killed by estranged wife' in China LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played The moment a migrant mother is reunited with her son Some 711 migrant children taken from their parents at the US-Mexico border have not yet been returned to them, despite a court-ordered deadline. US government lawyers said the children were not eligible to be reunited with their parents. The reasons given included a lack of confirmed family ties, or a parent having a criminal record or a communicable disease. In 431 cases the parents were no longer in the US, a court filing said. US officials separated more than 2,500 children from undocumented adults at the border with Mexico earlier this year, in a ""zero tolerance"" crackdown on illegal immigration. But it was suspended by President Donald Trump last month after a fierce backlash. Inside the chaotic effort to reunite separated families Why the US separated children from their parents,external The Trump administration says it has reunited more than 1,800 migrant children with family members. Its lawyers argue that it met the legal deadline, as the 711 remaining children are not ""eligible"" to be given back. This video can not be played Fox v MSNBC on immigration: How the news divides America The majority of the children were reunified with their parents in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, and 378 others were released in ""appropriate circumstances"". This covers those reunited with parents who were already out of government custody, those sent to another relative or family friend, and those who are now over the age of 18. Of the 711 deemed ineligible, 120 children's parents had ""waived reunification"", the government said on Thursday evening. Dozens more remain separated because of ""adult red flag"", referring to situations in which the child might be at risk. A court order imposed a deadline on the Trump administration to release all children aged between five and 17. San Diego federal judge Dana Sabraw ruled last month that all the detained minors separated under the policy should be brought back to their families by 26 July. ""By the court deadline this evening we are on track to reunite all eligible parents within ICE custody,"" said Chris Meekins of the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday. This video can not be played Trump supporters talk family separations and border security But the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has sued the government over the policy, said US officials had only met ""a self-defined deadline"". ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told reporters: ""The government shouldn't be proud of the work they're doing in separation. This is a disaster that they created."" The court filing says hundreds of children are ineligible to be reunited because their parents have left the country. The ACLU said it would try to trace the missing parents, but a former acting director of ICE, the agency that rounds up undocumented migrants, said he fears many families will never be reunited. ""There is a very high likelihood that those parents are not going to see their children again,"" John Sandweg told CBS News. The Trump administration earlier this month reunited more than 100 migrant children under five years old with their parents, though it missed a court-ordered deadline to do so. It said 57 of these youngsters were back with their families, though 46 others were deemed ineligible because of safety concerns, parental deportations, or other issues. US President Donald Trump halted the family separations in late June after pictures of locked-up children and audio of them crying in distress triggered uproar. But the reunions process has proved chaotic, with some children transported to see their parents only to end up back in their shelters after discovering their loved ones were not at the location. The families were held after entering the US illegally, while others claimed asylum at border crossings, citing violence in their home countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The children were being sent to various care facilities across the country, while the adults were held in detention centres or prisons.

"Charlotte Brown died in December 2015 when Jack Shepherd took her on a date on his speedboat A man has been found guilty of killing a woman in a speedboat crash on the River Thames during their first date. Jack Shepherd, 30, and Charlotte Brown, 24, were thrown overboard from the boat, which had a series of defects, in December 2015. Shepherd, who was absent during his Old Bailey trial, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence. The jury heard Shepherd, who is on the run after skipping bail, bought the boat ""to pull women"". Jack Shepherd pictured during his police interview Shepherd, of Paddington, will be sentenced on Friday. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. The court heard he met Ms Brown on dating website OkCupid and tried to impress her with a boat trip past the Houses of Parliament after a meal at The Shard. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error But their champagne-fuelled first date ended in tragedy when his boat capsized and she was thrown into the river near Wandsworth Bridge. The court had heard how Shepherd had entertained up to 10 women on the 1980s boat that he bought from Gumtree, having invited them back to his houseboat in Hammersmith. The boat was taken to the Old Bailey car park to be inspected by jurors during the trial In mobile phone footage filmed during the date, Ms Brown could be heard shouting that they were going ""so fast"" as Shepherd drove at more than double the 12 knot speed limit. On the return journey, Shepherd handed over the controls to Ms Brown who followed suit and went ""full throttle"". The speeding boat hit a submerged log and tipped over, sending both of them into the Thames. A warrant has been issued for Jack Shepherd's arrest Shepherd was found clinging to the hull and Ms Brown, from Clacton, Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found that Ms Brown died from cold water immersion. Riverside resident Steven Morrissey told the court that he heard a young man screaming for help. He said in a statement: ""He kept saying 'Help me, help me, somebody help me'. It was just 'Help me"" - not 'us', or 'her'."" Speedboat taken to Old Bailey as evidence Boat death accused 'wanted to show off' Man's boat 'seduction routine' went wrong In a statement read outside the Old Bailey, Ms Brown's sister Katie appealed for Shepherd to return from ""wherever he may be"" and ""take responsibility for the devastation he has caused our family"". ""We cannot allow Charli's passing to be in vain - her legacy will be to highlight the appalling lack of legislation and safety measures on our waterways. ""Charli died because she thought she would be safe taking a journey on Jack's speedboat - a speedboat we now know that was unsafe and that he bought with sole purpose of seducing young women."" This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie (middle) appealed for Shepherd to ""take responsibility for the devastation he has caused our family"" The court heard the boat had a number of defects, including faulty steering. Life jackets had been tucked away and the kill cord was not connected. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors: ""It was cold, it was dark; we submit it was sheer madness."" Jurors were told Shepherd denied manslaughter on the basis he had no ""duty of care"" towards Ms Brown. CCTV footage showed the boat after it had hit a submerged log and tipped over Shepherd told his lawyers in mid-May he would not attend his trial but the Crown Prosecution Service only found out a week before proceedings began. Prosecutors said police had spoken to his mother on 27 June and were told he had not been in contact since March and his phone number was no longer connected. His defence team insisted they did not know where he was, even though his solicitor had maintained telephone contact. It later emerged he had been receiving daily updates from the trial from his legal team.

"Port, now 43, from Barking in east London, was sentenced to a full life term in November 2016 All but one of 17 Met officers under investigation for the initial response to the serial killer Stephen Port refused to answer questions during interviews with the police watchdog. In November 2016Port was convicted of murdering four young men. Police ignored chances to catch him earlier, with the deaths not treated as murders until weeks after the last one. The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said its work was ""nearing completion."" It refused to comment on details of the interview process. The watchdog - formerly known as the IPCC - originally served misconduct notices on the officers in September 2016, prior to Port's trial. In March the following year - after Port had been jailed - the body said its inquiry was moving into the ""interview phase"". However, when - after two months - this had still not startedthe victims' families publicly expressed anger at the delay. In response, investigators told the BBC that a large volume of evidence had been disclosed to the officers, who had ""asked for time to understand and absorb the information that will be put to them in interview, which we have agreed so that the evidence we collect from them is as robust and comprehensive as possible."" Then, last summer, the watchdog said that interviews were ""under way"". However, the BBC now understands only one of the 17 officers freely answered questions from investigators. Seven were interviewed under gross misconduct notices - and ten under misconduct notices. Stephen Port: The killer the police missed New inquests over serial killer deaths Serial killer report 'will be damning' Sixteen of them - as they are entitled to - provided ""no comment"" interviews and instead submitted prepared statements. One officer, who was interviewed under a misconduct notice, has since resigned from the force, meaning that even if found to have breached standards of behaviour there is no system of delivering a sanction to them. Between June 2014 and September 2015, Port murdered Anthony Walgate, 23, originally from Hull, Gabriel Kovari, 22, from Lewisham, Daniel Whitworth, 21, from Gravesend, Kent, and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham, east London. Anthony Walgate (L) and Gabriel Kovari (R) were Port's first victims Port met his victims online, including through the dating app Grindr, before luring them to his flat in Barking, east London, where they were drugged before being raped. He murdered the four men by giving them fatal overdoses of the date-rape drug GHB. The first victim - Anthony Walgate - was found outside Port's flat and the other three either in or next to a nearby churchyard. Port was jailed for his initial lies about the circumstances of the first death, but police accepted his subsequent excuses - leaving him free to kill again. While on bail - prior to being sentenced - Port struck twice more and once again after coming out of prison. Daniel Whitworth (L) and Jack Taylor (R) were also killed by Port Port falsely linked his second and third victims together in order to cover up his crimes. A fake suicide note found in Daniel Whitworth's hand - which had in fact been written by Port - said he had accidentally killed his lover Gabriel Kovari and was taking his own life as a result. In fact, the two victims did not know one another. Police accepted the note at face value and treated the deaths as non-suspicious, despite concerns being raised by people close to both men. The fake suicide note, written by Port, sought to absolve him of any part in Mr Whitworth's death An investigation by the BBC revealed flaws in the evidence given by police at the original inquests forMr WhitworthandMr Kovari. After Jack Taylor's death, police were pressured into treating it as suspicious after his family began their own investigation and spotted similarities to the other three deaths. Port was captured after the case was passed to specialist homicide detectives. The initial response had been led by local officers from Barking and Dagenham. None of the officers from the successful inquiry are under investigation by the IOPC. In a statement, IOPC Regional Director Sarah Green said: ""Our investigation is nearing completion, and I will need to consider the final report carefully before coming to any view on its findings. ""We continue to keep the families of Stephen Port's victims, and the officers under investigation updated on our progress."" Scotland Yard said: ""We await the conclusion of an independent IOCC investigation which is currently ongoing. ""It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."" Inquests into the four deaths are expected next year, with a pre-inquest hearing scheduled to take place on 14 August.

"Amazon has reported record quarterly profits helped by a rise in online sales and demand for its cloud services. Profits hit a record $2.53bn (Â£1.9bn) in the three months to the end of June - about 12 times more than it made during the same period last year. Sales rose by 39% to $52.89bn, slightly less than analysts had been forecasting. Amazon's shares jumped more than 3% in after-hours trade. ""It was a strong quarter,"" said chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky. ""What I attribute it to is continued strength in some of our most profitable areas."" Alexa wants children to say please Trump steps up attacks on Amazon At the firm's lucrative cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, sales were up nearly 50% year-on-year to $6.1bn. Amazon is also starting to attract more money from advertising. Revenue from the firm's ""other"" category, which includes advertising, more than doubled to about $2.2bn. Retail sales in North America were healthy as well, rising about 44% to almost $32.2bn. Recruitment slowed in the quarter. Amazon is also starting to reap the benefits of previous infrastructure investments, allowing for less rapid spending growth, Mr Olsavsky said. Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights, said Amazon's profitability appears to be accelerating faster than expected. That, he wrote, will be ""music to ears of investors"" who have stood by Amazon and its famously long-term approach to deferring profit in favour of reinvesting in the company. Amazon is expected to account for roughly half of online sales in the US this year, according to research firm eMarketer.

"The official Vote Leave campaign spent more than Â£2.7m on targeting ads at specific groups of people on Facebook - helping it to win the 2016 EU referendum. The US social media giant has now released these ads to a committee of MPs investigating fake news - meaning everyone, not just those they were originally aimed at, can now see them. The ads, created by Canadian company Aggregate AIQ, often focused on specific issues - such as immigration or animal rights - thought likely to push the buttons of certain groups of people, based on their age, where they lived and other personal data taken from social media and other sources. The 120 pages of documents appear to back up the findings of the Electoral Commission, which ruled last week that Vote Leave broke electoral law by working jointly with another campaign, BeLeave - something denied by both groups. A number of BeLeave ads were sent from the Vote Leave Facebook account, including this one: There are 1,433 different messages in the data set released by Facebook, all with one common theme - although it is not always clear that they have come from a pro-Brexit campaign. Here is one that was targeted at animal lovers: This one, targeted at tea-lovers, is more obviously pro-Brexit: Polar bears were also recruited to the cause: The adverts contained in the Facebook data set were seen more than 169 million times in total. The BeLeave messages were more closely directed at younger voters, promising a ""brighter future"" if the UK could stop ""EU regulators keeping us in the past"" and accusing Brussels of regulating ride-sharing apps such as Uber and enforcing quotas on data streaming. Data provided by Facebook suggests some of the most seen images were produced by BeLeave. This image was displayed on the screens of target audience members more than five million times: Older voters tended to be treated to claims about how much money the UK was sending to the EU. More than 140 ads made reference to the controversial claim that Â£350m a week sent to the EU could be spent on the NHS instead: Alternative uses for the Â£350m included schools and flood defences: Vote Leave made the most of then US President Barack Obama's intervention in the referendum campaign, whenhe said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue""for trade deals. This ad was heavily targeted at older voters, with a reach of up to 25% among woman aged over 65 and 23% of men in that age group targeted by one version of it (as with many of the ads, the accompanying text was tweaked and refined from a basic ""parent"" ad): Immigration was another common theme, with one ad appearing to suggest the entire Turkish population was headed for the UK: Boris Johnson was the only politician to be pictured in the ads: Apart from one featuring Jeremy Corbyn, which was targeted at younger voters and accompanied by an old quote from the Labour leader: ""The EU takes away from national parliaments the power to set economic policy and hands it over to an unelected set of bankers."" Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party spent Â£32,750.73 with AIQ on pro-Brexit Facebook ads. Only 16 of the ads were delivered to users in Northern Ireland, according to the Facebook data. The remaining 24 were primarily seen by people in England. The 24 adverts, seen at least 1.96 million times - and potentially as many as 4.2 million times - were all posted in the final three days of the EU referendum campaign. Early on in the campaign, Vote Leave launched a giant data harvesting exercise through a competition to win Â£50m if you could correctly guess the result of all 51 games in the 2016 European football championship. The odds of winning the contest - which Vote Leave funded through an insurance policy - were calculated at one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It wasdescribed by one Vote Leave insider at the timeas a potential ""game changer"" because it would allow it to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum. The campaign recruited former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham to promote the contest: A separate group called Veterans for Britain had refused permission for its ads to be passed on, said Facebook. The Culture Media and Sport Committee is expected shortly to publish interim findings from its inquiry into fake news, which has taken evidence from whistleblower Christopher Wylie and technology company bosses as well as representatives of the separate Leave.EU campaign. Correction 27 July 2018: An earlier version of this story said some ads were seen by fewer than 1,000 people, according to the Facebook data, and this was an example of ""micro-targeting"". But former Vote Leave chief, Matthew Elliott, said the ads never ran, so we removed that reference.

Daniel Whitworth (L) and Jack Taylor (R) were also killed by Port Port falsely linked his second and third victims together in order to cover up his crimes. A fake suicide note found in Daniel Whitworth's hand - which had in fact been written by Port - said he had accidentally killed his lover Gabriel Kovari and was taking his own life as a result. In fact, the two victims did not know one another. Police accepted the note at face value and treated the deaths as non-suspicious, despite concerns being raised by people close to both men. The fake suicide note, written by Port, sought to absolve him of any part in Mr Whitworth's death An investigation by the BBC revealed flaws in the evidence given by police at the original inquests forMr WhitworthandMr Kovari. After Jack Taylor's death, police were pressured into treating it as suspicious after his family began their own investigation and spotted similarities to the other three deaths. Port was captured after the case was passed to specialist homicide detectives. The initial response had been led by local officers from Barking and Dagenham. None of the officers from the successful inquiry are under investigation by the IOPC. In a statement, IOPC Regional Director Sarah Green said: ""Our investigation is nearing completion, and I will need to consider the final report carefully before coming to any view on its findings. ""We continue to keep the families of Stephen Port's victims, and the officers under investigation updated on our progress."" Scotland Yard said: ""We await the conclusion of an independent IOCC investigation which is currently ongoing. ""It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.""

"Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley were granted licences to allow them access to cannabis oil Specialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by autumn, the home secretary has announced.

"Imran Khan giving his televised speech from his home on the outskirts of Islamabad Former cricketer Imran Khan has claimed victory in Pakistan's election, amid accusations of vote rigging by rivals. In a television address, he said: ""We were successful and we were given a mandate."" His PTI party is still expected to fall short of an overall majority, so it would have to seek coalition partners in order to form a government. Campaigning has been marred by violence. On voting day a bomb killed 31 people at a polling station. Mr Khan, the charismatic patrician who captained Pakistan to a World Cup victory in 1992, has long shed his celebrity playboy image and has recently faced accusations that his election challenge was benefiting from military interference in the nuclear-armed republic. An official confirmation of the vote is still to come. Can Imran Khan change Pakistan? Why Pakistan's election matters The party of disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has rejected the results, as have a host of smaller parties, all alleging vote-rigging and manipulation. The election has been seen as a contest between Mr Khan's PTI party and Mr Sharif's PML-N, with the party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the historically liberal PPP, widely expected to come third. In his address, Mr Khan said: ""I think this has been the clearest, fairest election Pakistan has ever had."" He added that he would investigate any claims to the contrary. He also appealed to his rivals to join hands with him to develop Pakistan. And he vowed to hold talks with India to seek a resolution to the dispute over the Kashmir region, a key flashpoint between the nuclear-armed countries. He also called for ""mutually beneficial"" ties with the United States, despite being an outspoken critic of that country's anti-terrorism measures in the region, such as drone strikes. Figures from the Electoral Commission show Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party has 116 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies being contested. Earlier, unofficial projections from Pakistan's Dawn Newspaper reported the PTI on 120. A total of 137 seats is required for a majority. This election will mark only the second time that a civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term in Pakistan. The turnout has been estimated at between 50% and 55% out of 106 million registered voters, AFP reports. On Thursday, Dawn said the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had raised questions over the voting process. ""The commission received complaints that in many areas women were not allowed to vote,"" the newspaper reported. Mr Sharif, who won the last election, is in jail after a scandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak, but remained a looming figure in this election. He appointed his brother, Shahbaz Sharif, as head of the PML-N, to run in his absence. Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's three-time PM Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Heir to a political dynasty Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a 29-year-old son of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, ran for the PPP, after becoming party chairman when he was still a student at Oxford University in the UK. Mr Khan, who first entered politics in 1996 but struggled for years on the political sidelines, now styles himself as a pious, populist, anti-poverty reformer. ""God has given me a chance to come to power to implement that ideology, which I started 22 years ago,"" he said in his speech. He also said he would not live in the prime minister's usual grand residence. ""Whatever the ruling elite has been doing in Pakistan so far with the taxpayers' money, I'm promising you today I will change all of that."" The cricket hero turned politician The 65-year-old campaigned on a message of anti-corruption and vowed to take on Pakistan's entrenched political dynasties. But his views on Islamist militancy will be scrutinised if he becomes prime minister - he has criticised some of the Taliban's violence but last year his party's government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province gave $3m (Â£2.3m) to the notorious Haqqania madrassa, headed by a man known as the ""father of the Taliban"". This video can not be played Five things to know about Imran Khan (from 2018) Before the election Mr Khan told the BBC that if he were to be elected, his initial focus would be on the economy. Pakistan's currency, the rupee, has declined by 20%. Inflation is on the rise and the trade deficit widening. Exports such as textiles have taken a hit from cheaper products by regional competitors, including China. Analysts say the new government may need to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the country's second bailout since 2013. The BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad says tough decisions that could entail curbs on spending will be easier in a government Mr Khan is able to dominate. However, if his rivals continue to reject the results, and even potentially launch the kind of street protests Mr Khan did while in opposition, the country could face political instability. Pakistan has a population of nearly 200 million, and is a nuclear-armed rival to India, a key developing economy and one of the world's largest Muslim-majority nations. The country has been ruled on and off by the military during its 71-year history, so this election is significant because it is considered the country's second consecutive democratic transition. Both the run-up to the vote, and the vote count itself, have been highly controversial. Ahead of the elections, the PML-N complained of a targeted crackdown by the security establishment, with the alleged help of the courts, in favour of the PTI party. The Pakistani military denied interfering in politics. Independent media, meanwhile, say there have been blatant attempts to muzzle them, whilethe human rights commission has said there are ""ample grounds"" to question the legitimacy of the polls,external. Who are the 'angels' and the 'electables'? Viewpoint: Pakistan's dirtiest election in years Fears of 'creeping coup' in Pakistan After the polls closed on Wednesday, several political groups alleged that vote rigging was taking place in polling stations - something denied by election officials. Wednesday's attack in Quetta has been claimed by the Islamic State group Representatives from several parties said that their polling agents were expelled from polling stations during vote count and were denied certified copies of results - breaching election procedures. Analysts have also highlighted unusual delays in the announcement of unofficial results in dozens of constituencies, especially in the crucial province of Punjab which has been a stronghold of PML-N. Election officials say delays in releasing the results are simply down to failures in the electronic reporting system and that votes are now being counted manually. Can Imran Khan change Pakistan?

"The seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, was the hardest-hit community Greece has ""serious indications"" that a fire that killed at least 83 people near Athens earlier this week was started deliberately, Citizen Protection Minister Nikos Toskas says. The blaze broke out on Monday and hit coastal villages popular with tourists. Some 60 people are still being treated in hospital, 11 in intensive care. Dozens more are missing. Opposition politician Maria Spyraki accused the government of an ""abject failure"" to protect lives and property. Ms Spyraki, spokeswoman for the conservative New Democracy, said the government ought to have warned residents via the media, deployed more firefighters, and evacuated people from Mati immediately. The coastal area east of Athens was known to be high-risk, the Greek daily Kathimerini reports. Rescue workers searching a cliffside in the seaside town of Mati found more human remains on Thursday. More than 500 homes were destroyed, and some have not yet been examined. Stench and smoke in Mati Aerial images reveal devastation The photos that explain the world's wildfires British man in hospital after Greek fires Identifying the victims is proving difficult as the bodies are so badly burnt. Many were caught close to the cliff as the flames spread rapidly, whipped up by winds as high as 120km/h (75mph). Some survivors were saved by the sea, but dozens of victims were unable to reach the water. This video can not be played ""The flames were chasing us into the water"" - survivor Mr Toskas also said that another fire that broke out near Athens a few hours earlier - but did not cause casualties - had been started intentionally. He added that ""climate conditions"" in the areas affected by fire were ""extreme due to climate change"". Earlier, Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos told the BBC that illegal construction had contributed to the disaster. He said building by residents between wooded areas was a ""crime"" that had resulted in blocked escape routes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that specialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products. Cannabis is currently a controlled drug as classified by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. A follow-up to this law, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations Act 2001, placed it under Schedule 1, which is the category for substances with no medicinal value. And this is the schedule being considered by the review. Cannabis plants are made up of more than 100 different cannabinoids, which have different impacts on the body and are concentrated to different extents in certain parts of the plant. The most well-known of these are THC and CBD. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid - the one that recreational users use to get ""high"". CBD does not have this effect. While almost all cannabinoids are controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act, CBD - or cannabidiol as it is also known - is not. For example, industrial hemp may be grown under licence in the UK. It is a strain of the cannabis plant that contains little or no THC, but does contain CBD. The Home Office says that it can contain a maximum THC content of 0.2% and that the THC must not be easily separated from it. Industrial hemp can be used for things such as building materials and clothing. CBD oil can also be extracted from these plants and, as it is a legal cannabinoid, can be sold in the UK. The oil has been thought to have some medicinal properties, including relieving inflammation, pain relief and reducing anxiety, although there have not been conclusive scientific studies on this. In 2016, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that CBD products, if advertised for these medical purposes, needed to be licensed. Licences for CBD oil as a medicine have not been granted yet but the products can still be sold as long as claims are not made about their medical benefits. Holland and Barrett sells some CBD oils as food supplements. The oil that has been in the news recently due to its use by those with epilepsy is cannabis oil, which has a higher THC content, and so, unlike CBD oil, is not usually allowed in the UK. But Sativex, which is a 50-50 mix of THC and CBD produced in a lab, has been approved for use in the UK by the MHRA as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, in 2014, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which issues guidance to NHS doctors, gave the medicine""do not recommend"" status,external, saying it was not cost-effective. Sativex is a spray. Each 10ml bottle contains 90 doses and costs about Â£140. Paul Hunt, from CBD product supplierVsavi,external, said:  ""This ruling by the Home Secretary is very welcome and we hope that this is just the start of changing opinions and legislation of CBD products by authorities in the UK.""

"The BBC has agreed to pay Sir Cliff Richard Â£850,000 towards his legal costs within 14 days, following his privacy case against the corporation. A judge ruled the BBC infringed the singer's privacy in its reporting of a police raid on his home in 2014,awarding him Â£210,000in damages. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged as part of the investigation. The BBC sought leave to appealagainst the High Court ruling but the application was rejected. The corporation has apologised to Sir Cliff for the distress caused, but wanted permission to appeal, arguing the court judgement could threaten press freedom. The BBC will now decide whether or not to go directly to the Court of Appeal to seek permission to appeal. A BBC spokesperson said: ""This is a complex case and while we hadn't decided on whether to pursue an appeal, we sought permission today in order to keep all options open. ""We reiterate that we are very sorry to Sir Cliff for the distress caused and have no desire to prolong this case unnecessarily, but the ruling has raised significant questions for press freedom and we are considering the best way to address these."" The judge's findings had included that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while he was a suspect in the South Yorkshire Police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. Reaction to the Sir Cliff case BBC bosses 'should carry the can' Barrister Gavin Millar QC, leading the BBC legal team, told a hearing on Thursday it was ""appropriate"" for the corporation to pay legal fees incurred by Sir Cliff. The Â£850,000 may not be the final total for his legal fees, but Sir Cliff is being given it now to pay his lawyers. The singer's lawyer, barrister Justin Rushbrooke QC, did not give an overall figure for how much the case had cost his client, but Sir Cliff told the trial he had spent more than Â£3m.

By Amol Rajan, BBC News media editor For the BBC, the decision whether to spend more money on this case is a difficult dilemma with high stakes. There are many factors to consider. First, will an appeal cause further distress to Sir Cliff? The corporation has said that it is sorry for the distress caused to him, so why extend the agony? Second, to fight this verdict is to keep it in the public eye. An appeal could create the possibility of more adverse publicity. Third, what are the chances of success?

"Astronomers got the result by tracking the movement of a star as it passed through the gravitational field of a black hole The black hole at the centre of our galaxy has helped astronomers confirm a key prediction of Albert Einstein's ideas. By observing a cluster of stars near the hole, they were able to confirm a phenomenon known as ""gravitational redshift"". It's when the wavelength of light gets stretched out in response to a gravitational field. The result,externalwill help scientists better understand the physics of black holes. The Very Large Telescope (VLT),externalin Chile found evidence for Einstein's prediction by observing a star, called S2, that passed through the intense gravitational field of Sagittarius A* - the huge black hole at the heart of the Milky Way. The effect they observed, gravitational redshift, occurs as particles of light (photons) climb out of a gravitational well like a black hole. As they do, the light's wavelength gets drawn out. Albert Einstein would no doubt be delighted This shifts the wavelength to the red part of the light spectrum - hence ""redshift"". It's predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, but has never been observed in an intense gravitational field such as that of a black hole. Frank Eisenhauer, from theMax Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE),externalin Garching, Germany, said the measurement opened the door to more studies of the physics of black holes. In future, he said, ""we will see many more effects of general relativity in the galactic centre black hole. We will see the orbits of the stars change, we will see light go in circles, we will even see space-time rotate together with the black hole."" Dozen black holes at galactic centre Black hole blasts out 'double burp' Reinhard Genzel, also from MPE, said: ""There is still more work to do to really come as close as you can to the event horizon [the ""point of no return"" of the black hole] where you might expect strong deviations from Einstein's theory."" FranÃ§oise Delplancke, from theEuropean Southern Observatory (Eso),external, which operates the VLT, said that the laws of physics could only be tested here in the Solar System under particular circumstances. ""So it's very important in astronomy to also check that those laws are still valid where the gravitational fields are very much stronger,"" she explained. The observations were carried out with the Very Large Telescope in Chile S2 is one member of a star cluster that surrounds Sagittarius A*. These stars reach mind-boggling speeds when they approach the black hole - S2 comes very close to Sagittarius A* every 16 years. Astronomers followed S2 before and after it passed close to the black hole on 19 May 2018, tracking its progress hour-by-hour. When S2 passed by the black hole at a distance just 120 times that of the Earth from the Sun, it reached an astonishing orbital velocity of 8,000 km/s. That corresponds to about 2.7% of the speed of light. The astronomers found that light from the star was indeed stretched to longer wavelengths by the very strong gravitational field of Sagittarius A*. The results were perfectly in line with the theory of general relativity - and not explained by Sir Isaac Newton's ideas - which exclude such a shift. ""In sport, you would say it was 1-0 for Einstein,"" said Frank Eisenhauer. Artwork: Astronomers want to test other aspects of physics around black holes Odele Straub, from theParis Observatory, in France,external, said: ""What we hope is at some point we will see something in the galactic centre that we can't explain with Einstein's theory - that would be really, really exciting. Because then we could go back to the drawing board and come up with something better."" The astronomers are continuing to observe S2; observations of its trajectory should yield new findings about the extreme conditions around the Milky Way's central black hole. Gravitational redshift occurs because, in order to escape a gravitational well such as a black hole, particles of light (photons) must expend energy. However, at the same time, these photons must travel at a constant speed - the speed of light. Therefore, the photons can't lose energy by slowing down, but must expend it in another way. This lost energy manifests itself as a shift towards the red end of the light spectrum.

"This video can not be played Sir Paul McCartney played a lunchtime gig, as The Beatles often did at the original Cavern More than six decades have passed since Sir Paul McCartney first performed at the Cavern Club, but the Beatles legend returned to roll back the years at a ""secret"" gig there on Thursday. Around 250 people crammed into a sweaty Cavern to hear the 28-song set. The set list ranged from classics he performed when the Beatles started out at the Liverpool venue in the early 1960s to songs from his new solo album. ""Coming back here is pretty amazing for me,"" the 76-year-old told the crowd. He skirted over the fact that the original Cavern was filled with rubble in 1973 and the venue for Thursday's show was a more modern live room attached to a replica Cavern that was built nearby. ""Imagine this for me - all these years ago when we played the Cavern we didn't know if we'd have any future,"" he said. ""But we did OK."" Allow Twitter content?

The crowd included 175 lucky fans who had to race to collect the free tickets from the Echo Arena box office when the show was announced on Thursday morning. Tom Gilchrist, 28, from Liverpool, started waiting outside the Cavern first thing after hearing rumours of the gig. But they jumped in a taxi when they heard they had to get to the arena. They joined others running to the box office, and saw one woman faint in the process. ""It was like Beatlemania all over again,"" he said. Friend Chris Clements described the concert as ""probably the best thing that's ever happened to me in my life"". He said: ""We were so close he could have been in my lounge at home."" His girlfriend Dana Fischetti, 22, happened to be visiting from Connecticut, USA. ""I'm so lucky,"" she said. ""The chances of this happening are so long. It doesn't feel real that this is really happening. I love The Beatles."" Sir Paul greeted the crowd by adapting the lyrics from the song Michelle: ""Liverpool! Cavern! These are words that go together well."" After an introductory jam, he launched into ""the song that got me in The Beatles"" - Eddie Cochrane's Twenty Flight Rock, which Sir Paul played as his audition for John Lennon in 1957. However he stopped the song halfway through and showed a rare bad mood when he berated the crowd for filming and taking pictures on their phones. ""I think you've all been told not to take photos,"" he said. ""And you're taking them, and you're taking them, and I don't want to get put off, and you're putting me off."" One fan was ejected for filming during the opening jam, even before Sir Paul had made his plea. Smartphones weren't an issue when The Beatles played at the original Cavern almost 300 times between 1961-63. Since then, Sir Paul has only played at the current Cavern once, in 1999. On Thursday, he said returning to the venue had given him ""flashbacks to the early days"". He paid tribute to late bandmates John Lennon and George Harrison, and his set included In Spite of All the Danger, written and recorded when the group were still The Quarrymen. The Beatles played The Cavern 292 times in the early '60s There were also Beatles and Wings hits like Magical Mystery Tour and Band on the Run, as well as several tracks from his forthcoming solo album Egypt Station. If this gig and those songs are anything to go by, he's keen to show he's still full of vim, vigour and virility. Come On To Me, with its chorus ""If you come on to me, well I'll come on to you"", sounds like an attempt to suggest he'd still be casually courting, if he wasn't happily married. He told the crowd the lyrics of another new one, titled Fuh You, are ""open to interpretation"" - when in fact they convey even more buccaneering machismo. ""He's still got it,"" said one concertgoer, James Jardine, from Liverpool. He added: ""To get so close to someone who's so famous and iconic is unbelievable. You feel you could reach out and touch him."" Hundreds more weren't so lucky and had to make do with listening to a busker playing The Beatles' hits as they waited outside for a glimpse of the rock legend. The Cavern Club concert comes weeks afterhe played a surprise show for about 50 fansat the city's Philharmonic pub for James Corden's TV show. On Monday, healso performed at Abbey Road Studios- where The Beatles famously recorded - watched by stars including Kylie Minogue, Johnny Depp and Stormzy.

"The EU's chief negotiator has ruled out allowing the UK to collect customs duties on its behalf, a key UK proposal for post-Brexit trade. Michel Barnier said the UK wanted to ""take back control"" of its money, law and borders - but so did the EU. The EU would not delegate ""excises duty collection to a non-member"", he said. Both he and UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said progress had been made but ""obstacles"" remained before reaching a deal in October. Mr Raab said: ""We have agreed to meet again in mid-August and then to continue weekly discussions to clear away all the obstacles that line our path, to a strong deal in October - one that works for both sides."" Laura Kuenssberg: What now for the government? Ex-Waitrose boss: No deal 'would push up food prices' The UK's four Brexit options He replaced David Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary in protest at Theresa May's plans for a future economic relationship between the UK and EU, as set out in the White Paper. That set out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The UK's plan involves it collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Michel Barnier wants the UK to make a choice. If it wants to have frictionless trade with the EU's single market then it will have to join a customs union, or something like it, which will mean applying the EU's tariffs and reducing the scope for doing free trade deals with others. If it wants more freedom, it will have to agree arrangements with the EU that will reduce friction but not eliminate it altogether. It's an old tune that sounds different after the publication of the UK's White Paper, which was supposed to have solved this dilemma. It also sounds like the UK will propose a revamped version of its idea for avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland but the two sides are still divided on whether that should have a time-limit or not. Lost among all of this will be the nugget of good news: Big strides have been made on security co-operation after Brexit. But Mr Barnier said retaining control of the money, law and borders also applied to the EU's customs policy. ""The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures,"" he said. Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Barnier appeared to have delivered a significant blow to Mrs May's controversial proposals, which have already been criticised by pro-Brexit Tory MPs. Speaking after talks with Mr Raab, Mr Barnier said that Theresa May's Brexit White Paper plan was a ""real step forward"". He highlighted agreement on security measures and said both sides wanted a wide-ranging free trade deal. But he added: ""To be frank, we are not at the end of the road yet."" Please upgrade your browser While UK proposals on security marked ""a real step forward"" and he welcomed the acknowledgement that the European Court of Justice was the only arbiter of EU law, he added: ""In contrast, on our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult."" Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said the UK proposals had been designed ""to respect the result of the referendum, and the core principles of the EU"". ""We have considered the innovative approaches the EU has taken in the past with other third countries - when the political will has been there,"" he said.

"Facebook shares fell sharply on Thursday, after the social media network warned investors of slowing revenue gains and increased spending. The firm's shares closed nearly 19% lower, wiping more than $120bn (Â£92bn) off Facebook's market value. The fall also dragged down the tech-rich Nasdaq share index, which closed 1% lower. Facebook's forecast came as the firm faces a backlash over its handling of fake news and user data. The company said it expected to boost spending by 50% or more, as it tries to improve the way it monitors content, tracks advertisers and treats user data - areas where it has faced regulator scrutiny. The firm also warned investors that revenue growth would be hurt as people make use of new options to limit advertising and less profitable overseas markets drive growth. Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said its margins would shrink to the mid-30% range, from about 44% in the most recent quarter. The concerns, despite Facebook's year-on-year revenue growth of more than 40% in the most recent quarter, appeared to infect some other technology stocks. Twitter, which has faced similar criticism to Facebook and is due to report quarterly results to investors on Friday, closed down by nearly 3%. Facebook's China plans thrown into doubt Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it Instagram pins hopes on IGTV's vertical video Other companies proved more resilient. Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, and also relies on digital advertising, ended the day less than 1% lower (0.75%), while music streaming service Spotify gained almost 4.5%, after reporting stronger than expected user growth. Many of the factors affecting Facebook are unique to the company, said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has appeared before regulators this year The firm has been in the spotlight for its involvement with data firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has also changed the news feed to emphasise posts from family and friends, tweaks that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg had previously cautioned would affect profitability. Analyst Richard Greenfield of BTIG Research wrote in a note that investors were ""overreacting"". He said Facebook remained a rich opportunity for advertisers, and the investments it is making should drive long term growth. ""We were pretty stressed out during Facebook's Q2 2018 conference call and could sense the fear/panic in investors voices afterwards,"" he wrote. However, he added: ""Mobile is eating the world and Facebook is a core holding to benefit from that shift.""

"The EU's chief negotiator has ruled out allowing the UK to collect customs duties on its behalf, a key UK proposal for post-Brexit trade. Michel Barnier said the UK wanted to ""take back control"" of its money, law and borders - but so did the EU. The EU would not delegate ""excises duty collection to a non-member"", he said. Both he and UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said progress had been made but ""obstacles"" remained before reaching a deal in October. Mr Raab said: ""We have agreed to meet again in mid-August and then to continue weekly discussions to clear away all the obstacles that line our path, to a strong deal in October - one that works for both sides."" Laura Kuenssberg: What now for the government? Ex-Waitrose boss: No deal 'would push up food prices' The UK's four Brexit options He replaced David Davis, who quit as Brexit secretary in protest at Theresa May's plans for a future economic relationship between the UK and EU, as set out in the White Paper. That set out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The UK's plan involves it collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. Michel Barnier wants the UK to make a choice. If it wants to have frictionless trade with the EU's single market then it will have to join a customs union, or something like it, which will mean applying the EU's tariffs and reducing the scope for doing free trade deals with others. If it wants more freedom, it will have to agree arrangements with the EU that will reduce friction but not eliminate it altogether. It's an old tune that sounds different after the publication of the UK's White Paper, which was supposed to have solved this dilemma. It also sounds like the UK will propose a revamped version of its idea for avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland but the two sides are still divided on whether that should have a time-limit or not. Lost among all of this will be the nugget of good news: Big strides have been made on security co-operation after Brexit. But Mr Barnier said retaining control of the money, law and borders also applied to the EU's customs policy. ""The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures,"" he said. Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Barnier appeared to have delivered a significant blow to Mrs May's controversial proposals, which have already been criticised by pro-Brexit Tory MPs. Speaking after talks with Mr Raab, Mr Barnier said that Theresa May's Brexit White Paper plan was a ""real step forward"". He highlighted agreement on security measures and said both sides wanted a wide-ranging free trade deal. But he added: ""To be frank, we are not at the end of the road yet."" Please upgrade your browser While UK proposals on security marked ""a real step forward"" and he welcomed the acknowledgement that the European Court of Justice was the only arbiter of EU law, he added: ""In contrast, on our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult."" Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said the UK proposals had been designed ""to respect the result of the referendum, and the core principles of the EU"". ""We have considered the innovative approaches the EU has taken in the past with other third countries - when the political will has been there,"" he said. ""In sum, the UK has set out our plans in detail. Those plans are ambitious, principled and pragmatic. I am committed to injecting new energy into these talks, along with Michel."" Turning to Mr Barnier, he said: ""Michel, we have work to do."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work.

"This video can not be played Greek fires: Survivors confront defence minister over response Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos has told the BBC illegal construction contributed to one of the country's worst-ever wildfire disasters. He said building by residents between wooded areas was a ""crime"" that had resulted in blocking escape routes. Mr Kammenos was confronted by angry locals as he visited areas devastated by fires east of Athens this week. At least 83 people died and search teams fear they will find further victims as dozens more are missing. Dozens of rescue workers searching a cliffside in the seaside town of Mati on Thursday found more human remains. Many of the victims were caught close to the cliff as the flames spread rapidly, whipped up by winds as high as 120km/h (75mph).  Relatives have been providing their DNA to help identify the bodies of the victims. Some 60 people are still being treated in hospital, 11 of them in intensive care. Arriving in the village of Mati, where many people died, Mr Kammenos was surrounded by residents who accused him of abandoning them. The seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, has been the hardest-hit community ""You let people burn for no reason. You left us to the mercy of God,"" a woman told the minister, who was accompanied by the local mayor and the head of the military, One man told the BBC he had reached the fire station to ask for help, and found firefighters unaware of the blaze. Another resident complained that people had been advised to dive into the sea to escape, when most of the elderly were unable to reach the sea in the first place. Many of the survivors were saved by the sea, but dozens of victims were unable to reach the water. Stench and smoke in Mati Aerial images reveal devastation The photos that explain the world's wildfires British man in hospital after Greek fires Mr Kammenos, a combative figure who leads the nationalist Independent Greeks, rejected accusations that the government had failed to protect its citizens. This video can not be played ""The flames were chasing us into the water"" - survivor The actions of some residents had closed the roads to the beach, he argued. ""This is a crime from the past,"" he said. ""This coast of Athens, all these properties, the majority are without a licence, and they have occupied the coast without rules."" Rafina Mayor Evangelos Bournous said one in four houses had been completely destroyed by the fire, while 50% more were partially damaged. A satellite map of the area revealed the scale of the fire damage, showing that more than half the 12,760 acres affected were residential areas. The mayor defended the role of the military, arguing that if the army had not been able to stop the fire spreading, it would have razed the entire area. EU satellite service Copernicus produced a map showing the almost complete devastation of residential areas With many people still unaccounted for, a harrowing account emerged from the head of the Greek forestry federation, Georgos Papadias, who said firefighters had focused their resources on a separate fire to the west of Athens, leaving the East Attica coast exposed. Mr Papadias had been in the village of Kokkino Limanaki, on the southern edge of Mati when the fire struck. It was like a horror movie, he said, with injured and elderly pleading for help, and he was not being in a position to do anything, No alarm was sounded to warn residents or tourists, and no evacuation was organised from the coastal resorts of Maki and Kokkino Limanaki and the village of Neos Voutzas just inland. But once the fire crossed the main road through the area, Marathon Avenue, residents had no means of escape. Greek newspapers complained that residents could have no confidence in official organisations as civil protection was non-existent, and no lessons had been learned since the last devastating fires to hit Greece, in 2007. Mr Papadias spoke of cars blocking the roads as he tried to escape. He said he had lost neighbours to the disaster and a friend was in a grave condition in hospital. Among the missing are twin nine-year-old girls Vassiliki and Sofia Philippopoulou, who were with their grandparents near Mati at the time of the fire. The girls' father said he thought he had seen them being rescued in footage broadcast by Greek TV. However, the children in the video turned out to be different girls.

"The head of the Royal College of Nursing has apologised after nurses in England complained of being ""misled"" over a new pay deal. The union had said they would receive a 3% pay rise this month as part of a new three-year pay deal. But a number of nurses took to social media to say their pay had gone up by much less - in some cases by pennies. RCN general secretary Janet Davies apologised, saying the deal had been presented ""in good faith"". NHS staff vote for 6.5% pay deal Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff In June, 13 unions agreed to a three-year pay deal for more than one million NHS workers in England. Only one union, the GMB, rejected the deal. At the time, the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the pay rise was ""incredibly well-deserved for staff who have never worked harder"". Nurses had been told by the RCN they would get a 3% pay rise in their July pay packets, backdated from April. But this week, some took to Twitter to complain that the increase they had expected had not materialised. Many expressed anger at the RCN and the government about the deal, with some nurses saying they felt they had been misled by their union. Ms Davies responded by offering a ""sincere personal apology"". ""I'm as dismayed and angry as you are and I will fight the corner of members at every turn,"" she said. ""In good faith, we told all members that they would receive a 3% uplift this summer. ""I now find that this is not the case for everyone. I can assure you that I am demanding answers for you."" The RCN added in a statement that it would not be reopening the deal. ""Despite some delays to payments, over the three years the deal has to run, members will receive the full amount promised,"" a spokesman said. ""We are sorry for any confusion caused about what members were due to receive this month."" However, NHS Employers, which agreed the pay deal with the unions, said the agreement had never promised a 3% rise in the first year. ""This miscommunication is very unfortunate and clearly the RCN will need to review all of its communications to understand the extent of its error. ""We hope that this issue between the RCN and its membership can be resolved quickly, andwe would direct colleagues towards the information on our website,,externalwhich makes clear the pay journeys for different staff over the next three years.""

"The discovery was made two years ago but has only now been revealed A gold nugget - claimed to be one of the biggest ever found in Britain - is reported to have been discovered in a Scottish river. The gold, dubbed the Douglas Nugget, weighs 85.7g, and has been estimated to be worth more than Â£50,000. It was discovered two years ago but has remained secret until now. The man who found it wishes to remain anonymous and the exact location of the river where the nugget was situated is also being kept under wraps. Gold expert Leon Kirk, from Gold Panning Supplies UK, said: ""This is a very exciting and unprecedented find. ""But the nugget's rarity means it is very hard to put a price on it. ""I would say it is worth at least Â£50,000 but, as it's rarer than an Aston Martin or a Faberge egg, a billionaire could easily come along and pay a lot more for it. ""Historically, it is off the Richter scale."" Gold expert Leon Kirk said the nugget could be worth more than Â£50,000 The man who found it, who is in his 40s, said he came across it by ""sniping"" - which sees gold hunters don a dry suit and snorkel before lying face down in a river. He said he had discovered it while out searching with a friend and had not initially realised how big it was but when they did it provoked a reaction of delight. ""I took off my glove and picked it up, jumped out of the water and screamed 'bingo!' to my friend,"" he said. ""We were both stunned and couldn't believe it. I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime."" The owner is currently unsure what to do with his nugget, but is keeping it in a safety deposit box in the meantime. Mr Kirk said he hoped it would end up being purchased by a British museum, although legally it could have to be handed over to The Crown Estate. He suggested anyone else interested in learning how to look for gold should head to the ""Mecca of gold-panning"" at Wanlockhead in Dumfries and Galloway. Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation and curator at The Hunterian, University of Glasgow, said it was difficult to say if the nugget could have broken off from a larger chunk. The find was made using a process known as ""sniping"" ""The rounded edges of the piece indicate that it has certainly been in the watercourse for a while,"" he said. ""The size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far, though."" A number of other large nuggets have been found in British waters with a 59g lump discovered in Cornwall in 1808. In 2016,it emerged a 97g nugget had been found off the coast of Angleseywhich was thought to have come from a ship which sank nearby. A year earlier a nugget reckoned to be worth about Â£10,000was found in the south of Scotland. Analysis: Dr Neil Clark, author Scottish Gold: Fruit of the Nation It is not just unusual, it is the largest nugget, by far, to have been found in Britain for more than 500 years, so it is also a very exciting find in a historical sense. Gold is not easy to find in Scotland. There are a number of places where licences can be readily obtained and you can prospect for small flakes of gold. If you find more than half a gram of gold after a day's work, you are doing well. Gold in Scotland can be formed by a multitude of processes. As the large nugget encapsulates pieces of milky quartz, it is likely that the gold accumulated in a quartz vein, possibly by deep hydrothermal activity related to mountain building over 350 million years ago. The source of the gold is from hot acid waters dissolving minerals accumulated in sediments and other rocks as they are put under pressure during mountain building, sometimes related to the emplacement of large bodies of molten rock (for example, granite magma).

"A photo from the plane showed both teams together in business class - before the women returned to economy The first mixed-sex tour in Barcelona football club's history has run afoul of women's team fans - after it emerged only the men flew in business class. The club posted glossy promotional video of the men's and women's teams boarding their US-bound plane together. But on board, after a photo op, the women were nowhere to be seen in the rest of the video. Photos posted to the female players' Instagram accounts, however, showed their team flying in economy. The division was spotted by eagle-eyed supporters of the women's team, who asked why the men - some of whom were from the ""B team"" as top-rated players were resting after the World Cup - got preferential treatment.

"Alfie Dingley's family has paid for treatment in the Netherlands As the UK hosts a summit on thestate of medical cannabis in Europe,external, BBC Reality Check asks - does Britain really export more legal cannabis than any other country? Pro-drug reform campaign group Transform says the government is denying that cannabis has medical uses while at the same time overseeing ""the world's biggest government-licensed medical cannabis production and export market"". There has been controversy over two boys whose families want them to have legal access to cannabis-based products that are currently illegal in the UK.Six-year-old Alfie Dingleyand12-year-old Billy Caldwellboth suffer multiple seizures every day because of rare and treatment-resistant forms of epilepsy. It's true that the UK was the main producer and exporter of cannabis-based medicines in 2016, according to the UN's International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). The majority of it ended up in the US. Virtually all of that is one drug - Sativex - which is licensed to treat muscle stiffness and spasms in people with multiple sclerosis. Sativex is available throughout the UK but only provided free on the NHS in Wales. The Home Office says it doesn't define it as cannabis and that the UK doesn't export any cannabis in its raw form. British Sugar has a horticultural business close to its Wissington sugar beet plant Cannabis, along with many of the more than 100 chemicals it's made up of, is a controlled substance - possession and supply are punishable with fines and imprisonment. The family of Alfie Dingley want permission to use cannabis oil from the whole plant, which they believe will work better than any legal alternative. Cannabis is also being grown legally in the UK for another medicine, Epidiolex. It's currently being reviewed for the treatment of two rare forms of uncontrollable epilepsy, by medicine agencies in both the US and Europe. But it's not yet available. The specially bred type of cannabis plant used to make it is grown in a glasshouse in Wissington, Norfolk, by British Sugar - which also grows virtually all of the sugar beet in the UK. British Sugar - whose managing director is Paul Kenward  - has an exclusive deal with pharmaceutical company GW, which makes Epidiolex. Mr Kenward is married to drugs minister Victoria Atkins. She wasaccused of ""hypocrisy on a grand scale""over her husband's involvement in a legal cannabis farm. She declared the interest in Parliament when she was appointed in 2017 and excused herself from speaking for the government on cannabis.

"People at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, on Thursday After a brief burst of heavy rain last weekend, the summer heatwave is returning to some parts of the UK. Temperatures are forecast to rise again across southern England, with the hot weather set to continue into the first half of next week. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. As many struggle to stay cool this summer, here are some of the questions you've been asking Google. People sunbathe on Boscombe beach in Bournemouth, Dorset on Thursday The hot weather is set to persist in the south of the UK throughout the weekend, says BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne. Temperatures are expected to reach highs of 33C in London on Friday before dropping back slightly to 29-30C on Saturday and Sunday. ""The weekend as a whole across the UK will be largely fine and warm with spells of sunshine,"" he says - although the exception will be the north-west of Scotland which will see showers. BBC Weather: UK forecast The heatwave in the south-east is forecast to continue into the start of next week with highs of up to 32C - although the Met Office said it is unlikely to be record-breaking. But from Wednesday, the weather will become fresher as an area of low pressure develops and for the rest of the week temperatures look set to return to more ""normal levels"" of mid to low 20s. For the middle weeks in August, Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell predicts a return to the ""typical British summer"" with some more unsettled weather and a risk of showers. Temperatures will be closer to 20-22C in southern areas and 16-18C in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Hotter temperatures could return at the end of August as the weather becomes less changeable, Ms Mitchell said, although the outlook is still uncertain.

Enter your location or postcode in the search box to see your result.   The hottest day so far of 2018 was Thursday 26 July, when temperatures reached 35.3C in Faversham, Kent. But it still did not top the UK's highest ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham in Kent in August 2003. Provisional figures from the Met Office had suggested that Scotland experienced its hottest ever temperature in June, when 33.2C degrees was measured in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Butthe Met Office later rejected this figure,externalbecause a stationary vehicle with the engine running was parked near to the thermometers that measured this temperature, potentially contaminating the result. So Scotland's high of 32.9C recorded in August 2003 at Greycrook in the Borders still stands. In Seville, southern Spain, temperatures could reach 43C over the weekend Forecasters say the all-time temperature record in Europe could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Hot air sweeping in from Africa is causing temperatures to rise in Spain and Portugal andtemperatures are forecastto rise to up to 47C in parts. Warning as Europe's heat nears record Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Swiss police urge dogs to wear shoes The Association of British Travel Agents urged holidaymakers visiting the areas to ""copy the locals"". ""Avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day, drink lots of water and apply plenty of sun cream,"" a spokesman said. ""If you go to the beach, go early and when it feels like it's getting too hot leave, just as the locals do, and go and have a nice lunch in the shade."" You can't fail to notice how brown the UK landscape has become this summer. But, says the Royal Horticultural Society, brown lawns look a lot worse than they are and they should recover rapidly with renewed rainfall. When mowing dry lawns, the RHS advises gardeners to raise the height of cut on mowers to avoid weakening the grasses. Allow the clippings fall back onto the lawn - this will slow down the evaporation of water from the soil surface. The RHS also suggests watering the lawn (provided there are no hosepipe restrictions in force) in early morning, evening or even at night to reduce water wastage from evaporation. Find some more RHS advice here,external In pictures: The dried parks and parched lawns of Britain When there's warm weather, a false social media story about petrol tanks exploding in hot conditions tends to resurface. This is a complete myth, says the AA's head of road safety, Ian Crowder. ""Cars operate perfectly well in temperature extremes across the world - whether inside the Arctic Circle or in equatorial countries,"" he says. ""Cars fuel tanks are designed with a venting system that allows for the relatively small expansion and contraction of the fuel between temperature extremes. ""There is absolutely no risk that simply filling the tank will increase the risk of an explosion."" The NHS suggests keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows - or light-coloured curtains which are closed. ""The most sensible option is to use a [electric] fan,"" says Mary Morrell, professor of sleep and respiratory physiology at Imperial College London. ""It will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating."" Thin cotton sheets rather than nylon bedding are also recommended. Prof Kevin Morgan, director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, says a lukewarm shower before bed is preferable to a cold shower. Read the BBC Magazine article on sleeping during hot weather This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight and older infants out of the sun as much as possible, particularly in the summer and between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. Sun cream with a high sun-protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids. The NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. Rachel Frost, from Birmingham Dogs Home, has some advice for keeping canines cool this summer.

"If you hadn't noticed, it's getting hot. And it's going to continue with temperatures expected to hit 32C in some parts of the UK on Saturday. During last year's heatwave, scientists released new guidance on applying sun cream - suggestingsix teaspoons is enough. So do you know how to put it on and how often to apply it? And did you know it doesn't last forever? Dr Walayat Hussain of the British Association of Dermatologists helps Newsbeat debunk some myths... ""I wouldn't use that as a hard and fast rule,"" Dr Hussain says. ""It's better to keep doing it until all your skin is covered. ""We say six to eight teaspoons is enough to cover the body but that certainly depends on how much clothing you've got on as well. ""It's better to cover all of the skin that is exposed."" So if you were at the beach and not wearing much - use more than six teaspoons. ""It's like any product, it's got preservatives in so the manufacturer has to protect itself against the products degrading,"" Dr Hussain says. ""You just have to follow the advice on the bottle."" See more stories and videos like this Also, putting sun cream in the fridge doesn't have much of an impact. It's fine being stored in a ""cool, dry place according to what it says on the manufacturers' recommendation"". Of course putting sun cream in the fridge will mean it's cooler on your skin when you apply it. UK heatwave: How does sunscreen work? ""We say when you're out and about you should apply it every two to three hours,"" Dr Hussain says. The recent hot weather shouldn't have too much of an impact on how regularly you should apply it though. ""A lot of it depends on what you're doing. If you go in the water and you dry yourself off, you need to re-apply it because even the water-resistant stuff gets washed off. ""It all depends on your level of physical activity. We say between 11 and 3 you should try to seek the shade."" If you're sun bathing alone, Dr Hussain says you shouldn't leave your back exposed. ""Unless you're really flexible you can't apply it, so you should ask someone else to help you. ""That's where clothing becomes so important. If you're wearing a swimming costume you have to ask someone else to adequately apply it."" ""Prevention, obviously,"" Dr Hussain says. ""But then you need to get out of the sun, drink lots of water, hydrate yourself well and cool the skin down with moisturising cream.""

" Matt Merry can’t recall the exact words his mother used to tell him he was HIV-positive. He just remembers not knowing how to react, not at first, not in front of his mum. She had sat him down at a table in the back room of their home in Rugby to break the news. Matt was 12 years old. He’d had the virus for four years, his mum explained. An injection he’d received to treat haemophilia, the bleeding disorder he was affected by, had been contaminated with it. This was 1986, at the height of the Aids epidemic, and an HIV diagnosis was perceived as a death sentence. After the first signs of infection started to show, he would probably have two years to live, the doctors told his parents. That night, as Matt lay in bed with the lights out, the numbness he'd felt all day began to ebb away. The enormity of what he'd learned finally started to dawn on him. All he knew of HIV and Aids was TV footage of skeletal-looking young men, their bodies covered in sores, wasting away in hospital wards, and he started to cry. “From that point onwards, for the rest of my teenage years, I had this stopwatch hanging over my head - and at any minute someone could push that button and start this two-year countdown until I waste away and die,” he says.There was something else Matt’s mum had said to him, too - he wasn't to tell anyone. Not friends, not teachers, initially not even his younger brother. The next time he went to school he was carrying a secret that he couldn't share. In 1986, HIV and Aids were the subjects of an all-pervasive, visceral fear. In the media, the disease was largely associated with groups such as drug users and gay men, who were routinely stigmatised at the time. Matt had heard of homes that were daubed with graffiti - “AIDS SCUM” and so on – when a rumour spread that someone living there had the condition. The panic only intensified the following year, when the government released its infamous “tombstone” adverts, which depicted Aids as an ominous, deadly presence. Looking back, Matt thinks his parents made the right decision about keeping quiet. “It wasn’t really an option to let anyone know,” he says. Sometimes other pupils gave him stick about being a haemophiliac, and he can't imagine what would have happened if news of his HIV diagnosis had got out. It had emerged that thousands had been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products, and Matt had heard of schools where parents had pulled out their children on learning that there was a haemophiliac in the class. But the burden of secrecy weighed heavily on him. “It’s so lonely going through that and experiencing that on your own - not being able to talk to anyone about it, not being able to discuss it.” He was never offered any professional support or counselling. There were no psychologists or therapists to help him cope. “I guess I could have talked to my mum or dad or brother - but it’s almost like it was so upsetting at the time that I didn’t want to talk about it, because I knew I’d just break down in tears, so I just shut it away and got on with it.” To his friends and classmates, everything seemed normal. No-one knew what was going through his head. To him, it seemed a certainty that he’d be dead by the time he was 20. He could never have a girlfriend, let alone marry or have children. His family had nurtured ambitions for him - his dad was an engineer at the Rolls Royce plant in nearby Coventry, and both parents wanted their son to do well at school and go to university. But after he learned he was HIV-positive - he would later find out that he had been infected with hepatitis C too - Matt stopped trying at school. What was the point? “Why spend all that time revising and doing homework when I’m not actually going to have a career or anything?” he reasoned. Without realising it, Matt had been caught up in what's been called the biggest scandal in NHS history - one that has resulted in the deaths of at least 2,883 haemophiliacs in the UK, according to campaigners. It's feared that tens of thousands of non-haemophiliacs could have been infected via blood transfusions, too. He’d been diagnosed as a toddler with severe haemophilia, meaning his blood was slow to clot and he would bleed for longer than other children. This, in turn, meant Matt would bruise easily and cuts would take longer to repair. Bleeds could be extremely painful and restricted his mobility - blood would fill the cavities of his joints, which made moving them all but impossible. His parents wouldn’t let him climb trees or have a BMX bicycle. Haemophilia also meant Matt could never achieve his ambition of becoming a pilot with the RAF. But during the 1970s and 80s, a new treatment for haemophiliacs became available. Injections of proteins called factor concentrates - usually Factor VIII, as in Matt’s case - helped clot their blood. It was made from donated blood plasma, and there was so much demand for it that the NHS began importing it from abroad, notably the US. Now, instead of going into hospital every time he bled, Matt had a supply of Factor VIII at home - at first, his mum would inject him, and then he learned to do it himself. He’d go on summer camps in North Wales with other young haemophiliacs, accompanied by doctors equipped with supplies of Factor VIII, and the boys could play outdoors safe in the knowledge that they’d be treated if they fell and injured themselves. But unknown to Matt and his family, much of the imported American Factor VIII was made using blood plasma donated by prison inmates and drug addicts, who were high-risk groups for viruses like HIV and hepatitis C. In many cases they had been paid for it. And because the factor products were made in huge vats from the plasma of tens of thousands of people, if just one donation was infected that would be enough to contaminate the whole batch. Warnings about imported Factor VIII had been raised as early as 1974, and the government said it would make the UK self-sufficient in factor concentrates within three years – but it didn’t. As the Aids crisis unfolded in the 1980s, the Department of Health was warned again in writing that US blood products should be withdrawn, but it wasn’t until 1986 - 12 years after concerns were first raised - that this was advice was finally heeded. When Matt’s mother was told that her son had been infected with HIV, she hadn't even realised he’d been tested for it. She’d fastidiously kept records of the batch numbers of the Factor VIII he’d been given, though. She looked back through them to 1982, when he’d been given a series of injections of proteins produced by an American company. She didn't have any school photos of him taken that year because the photographer came on one of the many days when he was ill. At school, Matt had a tight circle of close friends, but none of them knew why his grades were plummeting. He did the bare minimum for his GCSEs, scraping through with five passes. He put even less effort into his A-levels: “I just spent the two years mucking around, having fun with my mates.” In the end, he had one E grade to show for it. But despite the dire predictions that he would die within two years, Matt still appeared to be healthy, apart from his haemophilia. On 19 April 1990, just after Matt turned 16, he was assessed by a psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital. “He believes there is a 50/50 chance he will develop Aids,” the doctor wrote in his report. “He tries not to think about the future and when he does feel upset he tries to distract himself.” Matt, the report continued, had a “strong psychological defence system” but this was “easily penetrated at which point he becomes clearly distressed”. It was likely that even if he did not develop Aids in the next few years, Matt would “suffer major emotional difficulties”, the psychiatrist said. “It will be difficult for him to make satisfactory relationships with people of the opposite sex, because of the very real danger of cross-infection,” he went on. “He is already worried about this and distressed at the fact that he will not be able to have children.” It was to his parents’ credit, the report concluded, that he was coping so well. Around this time, Matt began smoking cannabis. “I just thought I’d give it a go - you know, what harm’s it going to do? The damage has already been done.” From there he moved on to speed and ecstasy. It was now the early 1990s, and Matt threw himself into the rave scene. He’d stay up all night, off his face, and then “come back home to mum and dad the next morning, eyeballs as wide as saucers, and go to bed for the rest of the day”. His parents didn’t realise what was going on at first. Then one day he came home from college and his dad pulled out a stash box filled with speed and cannabis. They’d found it in Matt's bedroom. “What’s this?” his dad asked. His mum was in tears. Matt felt like the floor had fallen out of the room. His parents wanted to know why he’d been taking drugs. “I said: ‘Well, why not? You know, I might not have long to live. I want to try and enjoy and experience as much as I can before I die.’” It wasn’t an easy point to argue with. One night, when he was 17 or 18, Matt had been out drinking in town. He was walking home with a friend when something compelled him, for the first time ever, to tell someone outside his immediate family that he had HIV. The friend was shocked, but he was understanding. “It was a case of: ‘Well, OK, it is what it is, but you’re still my mate.’” They walked past the friend’s house, and then past Matt’s house, and they carried on walking and talking it over until three in the morning. The relief washed over Matt. Over the next three or four years he began telling his closest friends, individually. As time went on it became easier - he never had a negative reaction from any of them. “What does it mean?” they’d ask. “How are you? Are you going to be all right?” But on each occasion, he anxiously weighed up whether or not he could risk sharing his secret. “I always very carefully considered who I told,” he says. It was always a case of: “Can I trust this person?” After school, Matt signed up at a further education college in Leamington Spa. He didn't see much point getting a job, and it was another excuse to muck about for a while. He spent two years there not turning up to lectures very much, and left with no qualifications to show for it. Now he was 20. Many of his friends were at university in Birmingham, so he moved there, signed on and concentrated on partying. But he sensed that he was being left behind. His friends were moving on with their lives, earning degrees, getting together with girlfriends, and Matt wasn’t. There wasn't one single moment when it dawned on him, but slowly, over time, he began thinking: I’ve had this since I was eight years old, and I was always told I’d have two years to live. ""Well, what if it’s not two years? What if it’s longer?"" It had never occurred to him that he might reach 40, let alone 50 or 60. But if his health continued to hold out he was destined for a dead-end job. He realised he had to do something in case he was still alive in 10 years’ time. He applied for a diploma course at the University of Central England and was accepted. In his first year, for the first time since his HIV diagnosis, he worked hard at it. “That was a bit of a turning point for me,” he says. His efforts were rewarded with good grades. “It was like: I can actually do this.” Eventually, the diploma led to a degree. In the meantime, he travelled regularly to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to have his CD4 cells checked – these are usually killed off by the HIV virus, but his count was still normal. Each time they'd give him his results, he’d feel relieved. He’d treat himself to a CD or a video to celebrate. But although HIV had been the focus of all his worries, the hepatitis C he had also contracted from the contaminated Factor VIII was starting to affect his liver. A biopsy revealed it was scarred and damaged. The doctors suggested he go on a 12-month course of powerful drugs, ribavirin and interferon, in an effort to get rid of the virus. Matt knew from fellow haemophiliacs that the drugs were “pretty nasty”. Some of his friends had had to quit after a few weeks because of the side effects. At first, taking the drugs was like having the flu. “You’d be curled up in bed, shivering and sweating, for 24 hours after an injection, and you’d have to repeat the process three times a week.” After a while, the side effects faded away, and at the end of the 12 months, the doctors had amazing news for him - he was clear of hepatitis C. Matt was on the move. Australia was the furthest away he could go from Rugby, from everyone he knew and his entire life up until then. And that’s where he ended up. “I think I went travelling to get away from myself,” he says. “Fresh people that don’t know me. I could be someone different. I could forget, essentially, what I’d been through over the past few years and the emotional baggage.” He moved into a two-bedroom house in Sydney with seven other travellers. A close bond quickly formed between them all. They’d work all week and party at the weekends. Telling people he had HIV seemed easier here. He would only be in their company for a short time. They didn’t know his friends or anything about his life. He was still careful about who he spoke to about it, though their reactions didn’t matter so much to him. “I think within me there was an urge to just get it out,” he says. But for the first time, he started to contemplate the idea of having a relationship. Because of his HIV status, the notion had always been a difficult one for him. His parents had drummed into him the imperative to tell prospective partners and give them a choice and it was a far more daunting prospect than telling close friends. “I met some girls out there and had relationships - brief sort of holiday things, really,” he says. The first girl he told - they’d met travelling - didn’t handle the news well. He’d told her before they first slept together, but later, as the information sank in, her feelings about it began to change. “I think she sort of lived with it for a while,” he says. Then one evening they were both in someone else’s flat with a group of friends. “I just remember, she was sort of crying and her mates were comforting her and so on, and it just went tits up from there.” After he returned to the UK from Australia, just before Christmas 2000, a thought began to occur to Matt - he might be around for a long time. “I think travelling really helped, it made me see all this stuff, meet all these different people, and I could be… not someone else, but I was free of everything,” he says - including free of preconceptions about HIV. It helped that, with the arrival of anti-retroviral  treatments, other people stopped regarding HIV as an automatic death sentence. In 2003, Matt travelled to Bournemouth for a friend's stag do. In one bar, he found he'd been separated from his friends, so he struck up a conversation with a group of young women who were standing near him. He hit it off with one of them in particular. Before Matt left to rejoin the stag party, he swapped numbers with her. They kept in touch and soon they were dating. Early in the relationship, he mentioned he had HIV and braced himself for a rejection. “It didn’t faze her,” he says. “At first I didn’t know if it had sunk in, what I’d told her. It was just like,phew.” By 2008 they were married. “It’s not bothered her whatsoever.” Liz Hooper had two husbands. The same NHS scandal killed them both.Read her story: If he'd never imagined it would be possible for him to meet someone, then having children seemed completely off the agenda. “I thought it was physically, medically, impossible,” he says. But one of his childhood friends, a haemophiliac who had also attended the camps in North Wales, told Matt he had become a father thanks to a technique called sperm-washing, a form of assisted conception. Matt inquired about it and was dumbfounded to be told by a consultant that, because his viral load was still undetectable, it would be safe for him and his wife to have a baby naturally - without sperm-washing. “I couldn't quite understand what they were saying,” he says. “I was like: ‘Do you not know what I’ve gone through the last 15 or 20 years? Do you think I’m going to subject anyone else to that?'” However low the risk of passing on the virus was, it wasn’t one he was willing to take. The NHS funded three cycles of sperm-washing, which led to the birth of a son. Matt and his wife applied for assisted conception to have a second child, but this was refused. Despite a supporting letter from Matt’s HIV consultant pointing out that he had contracted HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products suppliedby the NHS, they were told these were not “exceptional circumstances”. They had to pay for the treatment that gave them their second son. Becoming a father was life-changing for Matt. And now, seeing his own boys approach the age at which he was infected brings home the enormity of what happened to him. “It’s the only time I get emotional about the whole thing,” he says. “It makes me so angry. It’s almost a displaced anger - I don’t feel as if it was done to me, it’s as if it was done to my kids.” If he was told today that his sons had two years to live, he says, “God, I don’t know what I would do, so God knows how my parents felt.” After decades of pressure from campaigners, a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal is getting under way – but while Matt is glad it’s taking place, he feels it’s long overdue. “There’s an uproar about the tragedy of Grenfell, and rightly so, but because we’re dying quietly, individually, behind closed doors, no-one knows that,” he says. Matt looks at where he is today with amazement. His hepatitis C has gone and his viral loads of HIV are still undetectable – he’s never had to take anti-retrovirals. Of about 1,250 haemophiliacs infected with both hepatitis C and HIV due to the scandal, according to the campaign group Tainted Blood, fewer than 250 are still alive. “It really is, in terms of health outcomes, like winning the lottery,” he says. He has a family and a home in London - he thinks his career is several years behind where it should be, “but actually I'm not too hard on myself because look what I’ve done, I mean, I’m here and I've done it off my own back.” He knows that many others haven’t been so fortunate. He’s hopeful that the forthcoming inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal will deliver justice, but he won’t allow himself to gettoohopeful. “Successive governments, Labour and Conservative and Liberal Democrat, have failed to address this issue and tried to put it on the back burner or just wait until we’re dead, until it goes away,” he says. Despite the vast number of victims, the scandal commands relatively little attention because of the legacy of stigma around HIV and Aids, he believes – which is why he is telling his story. “I'm pleased with where my life is at the moment - I’ve got a brilliant family, a wonderful wife, two wonderful kids,” Matt says. “I’ve got everything to be thankful for. But I shouldn’t have to be thankful for that.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9997514
"Imran Khan giving his televised speech from his home on the outskirts of Islamabad Former cricketer Imran Khan has claimed victory in Pakistan's election, amid accusations of vote rigging by rivals. In a television address, he said: ""We were successful and we were given a mandate."" His PTI party is still expected to fall short of an overall majority, so it would have to seek coalition partners in order to form a government. Campaigning has been marred by violence. On voting day a bomb killed 31 people at a polling station. Mr Khan, the charismatic patrician who captained Pakistan to a World Cup victory in 1992, has long shed his celebrity playboy image and has recently faced accusations that his election challenge was benefiting from military interference in the nuclear-armed republic. An official confirmation of the vote is still to come. Can Imran Khan change Pakistan? Why Pakistan's election matters The party of disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has rejected the results, as have a host of smaller parties, all alleging vote-rigging and manipulation. The election has been seen as a contest between Mr Khan's PTI party and Mr Sharif's PML-N, with the party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the historically liberal PPP, widely expected to come third. In his address, Mr Khan said: ""I think this has been the clearest, fairest election Pakistan has ever had."" He added that he would investigate any claims to the contrary. He also appealed to his rivals to join hands with him to develop Pakistan. And he vowed to hold talks with India to seek a resolution to the dispute over the Kashmir region, a key flashpoint between the nuclear-armed countries. He also called for ""mutually beneficial"" ties with the United States, despite being an outspoken critic of that country's anti-terrorism measures in the region, such as drone strikes. Figures from the Electoral Commission show Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party has 116 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies being contested. Earlier, unofficial projections from Pakistan's Dawn Newspaper reported the PTI on 120. A total of 137 seats is required for a majority. This election will mark only the second time that a civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term in Pakistan. The turnout has been estimated at between 50% and 55% out of 106 million registered voters, AFP reports. On Thursday, Dawn said the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had raised questions over the voting process. ""The commission received complaints that in many areas women were not allowed to vote,"" the newspaper reported. Mr Sharif, who won the last election, is in jail after a scandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak, but remained a looming figure in this election. He appointed his brother, Shahbaz Sharif, as head of the PML-N, to run in his absence. Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's three-time PM Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Heir to a political dynasty Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a 29-year-old son of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, ran for the PPP, after becoming party chairman when he was still a student at Oxford University in the UK. Mr Khan, who first entered politics in 1996 but struggled for years on the political sidelines, now styles himself as a pious, populist, anti-poverty reformer. ""God has given me a chance to come to power to implement that ideology, which I started 22 years ago,"" he said in his speech. He also said he would not live in the prime minister's usual grand residence. ""Whatever the ruling elite has been doing in Pakistan so far with the taxpayers' money, I'm promising you today I will change all of that."" The cricket hero turned politician The 65-year-old campaigned on a message of anti-corruption and vowed to take on Pakistan's entrenched political dynasties. But his views on Islamist militancy will be scrutinised if he becomes prime minister - he has criticised some of the Taliban's violence but last year his party's government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province gave $3m (Â£2.3m) to the notorious Haqqania madrassa, headed by a man known as the ""father of the Taliban"". This video can not be played Five things to know about Imran Khan (from 2018) Before the election Mr Khan told the BBC that if he were to be elected, his initial focus would be on the economy. Pakistan's currency, the rupee, has declined by 20%. Inflation is on the rise and the trade deficit widening. Exports such as textiles have taken a hit from cheaper products by regional competitors, including China. Analysts say the new government may need to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the country's second bailout since 2013. The BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad says tough decisions that could entail curbs on spending will be easier in a government Mr Khan is able to dominate. However, if his rivals continue to reject the results, and even potentially launch the kind of street protests Mr Khan did while in opposition, the country could face political instability. Pakistan has a population of nearly 200 million, and is a nuclear-armed rival to India, a key developing economy and one of the world's largest Muslim-majority nations. The country has been ruled on and off by the military during its 71-year history, so this election is significant because it is considered the country's second consecutive democratic transition. Both the run-up to the vote, and the vote count itself, have been highly controversial. Ahead of the elections, the PML-N complained of a targeted crackdown by the security establishment, with the alleged help of the courts, in favour of the PTI party. The Pakistani military denied interfering in politics. Independent media, meanwhile, say there have been blatant attempts to muzzle them, whilethe human rights commission has said there are ""ample grounds"" to question the legitimacy of the polls,external. Who are the 'angels' and the 'electables'? Viewpoint: Pakistan's dirtiest election in years Fears of 'creeping coup' in Pakistan After the polls closed on Wednesday, several political groups alleged that vote rigging was taking place in polling stations - something denied by election officials. Wednesday's attack in Quetta has been claimed by the Islamic State group Representatives from several parties said that their polling agents were expelled from polling stations during vote count and were denied certified copies of results - breaching election procedures. Analysts have also highlighted unusual delays in the announcement of unofficial results in dozens of constituencies, especially in the crucial province of Punjab which has been a stronghold of PML-N. Election officials say delays in releasing the results are simply down to failures in the electronic reporting system and that votes are now being counted manually. Can Imran Khan change Pakistan?

Back in 2016 his presidential campaign barred publications from his rallies after they ran critical articles. Perhaps some thought that, as president, Mr Trump would behave differently. But on this, as in countless other areas, President Trump operates just like Candidate Trump. In fact, hostilities may be growing. The president bashes the media in speeches and tweets. He refers to a growing number of outlets as ""enemies of the American people"". He has refused to call on certain reporters during media availability. His press office has limited access to some smaller briefings. Now an individual reporter has been blocked from a major presidential event - for shouting questions even though the president often answers such call-outs. The White House says it is frustrated by what it views as reflexively hostile media coverage. It points to instances where reporters got stories wrong or amplified inaccurate reports on social media. There may be a larger strategy at play, however. Mr Trump often seems intent on needling the media into righteous outrage, focusing their attention inward instead of on stories that could damage his administration. The public at large doesn't have much sympathy for the journalists these days. The president may feel that a conflict with the media pack is one he can win. Ms Sanders said a reporter, whom she does not name, has refused to leave after shouting questions, and ""was not welcome to participate in the next event"" - although colleagues from her network could do so.

"A photo from the plane showed both teams together in business class - before the women returned to economy The first mixed-sex tour in Barcelona football club's history has run afoul of women's team fans - after it emerged only the men flew in business class. The club posted glossy promotional video of the men's and women's teams boarding their US-bound plane together. But on board, after a photo op, the women were nowhere to be seen in the rest of the video. Photos posted to the female players' Instagram accounts, however, showed their team flying in economy.

"The parents of Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley want the boys to be able to access cannabis oil legally to control their seizures Doctors in the UK should have the option to prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products to patients with certain medical conditions, drugs experts have advised the government. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommends rules should be changed for these medications, if safe. It comes after high profile cases involvingchildren with severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil. The government must now agree on a definition for these products. The Council recommended that clinical trials be carried out urgently to improve understanding of medicinal cannabis products, as well as their safety and effectiveness. Its advice is in line with a recent review by the chief medical officer for England. Prof Dame Sally Davies said there was conclusive evidence of the therapeutic benefit of prescribing cannabis-based products for certain medical conditions. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was ""carefully considering"" both recommendations and would make a decision shortly. The Home Office recently grantedBilly CaldwellandAlfie Dingley, boys who have rare forms of epilepsy, a short-term licence to allow them access to cannabis oil, which their parents say helps to control their seizures. Cannabis for recreational use will remain illegal. The Council's advice is that only products meeting definitions decided on by the Home Office and the Department of Health will be moved out of schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 into schedule 2, which allows them to be prescribed by clinicians. Schedule 1 includes drugs not used for medical purposes, such as hallucinogenic drugs, raw opium and cannabis. The Council said there were still potential risks if cannabis-derived medicinal products were prescribed inappropriately and these needed to be carefully considered to avoid harm to patients. Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, chair of the ACMD, said: ""At present, cannabis-derived products can vary greatly in their composition, effectiveness and level of impurity. ""It is important that clinicians, patients and their families are confident that any prescribed medication is both safe and effective. ""The ACMD recommends that an appropriate definition be agreed by DHSC and MHRA promptly. ""Only products meeting this standard and definition should be given medicinal status."" It stressed that rules for synthetic cannabinoids, which are found in products such as 'Spice', would not be changed.

"For the BBC, the decision whether to spend more money on this case is a difficult dilemma with high stakes. There are many factors to consider. First, will an appeal cause further distress to Sir Cliff? The corporation has said that it is sorry for the distress caused to him. If they are sincere about that - and my sense is they are - why extend the agony? Second, to fight this verdict is to keep it in the public eye. When confronted with bad news, institutional leaders often think the best thing is to draw a line and move on. An appeal could create the possibility of more adverse publicity. Third, what are the chances of success? Legal advice will be crucial - though no guarantee, of course, of the likely outcome. Sir Cliff Richard: BBC agrees to pay Â£850,000 legal costs Cliff Richard: BBC seeks leave to appeal High Court privacy judgement And finally, this is public money. Sir Cliff is commonly regarded as a national treasure. Why throw more of other people's money - ie licence-fee payers' incomes - at a case in which a national treasure is aggrieved? Against all this, and in favour of a further appeal, there are practical and philosophical points. On the former, what is the cost of not appealing? If the freedom of journalists is diminished as a result of editorial decisions made by the BBC, then not fighting this verdict could lead to resentment in Fleet Street, where the BBC lacks friends. And then there is the principle. Many journalists, inside the corporation and beyond, really do feel that journalism will be damaged. Fran Unsworth is the BBC's director of news and current affairs Leading figures in the newspaper industry think this is just the latest slap in the face for an industry in turmoil. If the liberty of journalists to report without fear or favour is reduced, how can an organisation like BBC News sit idly by? What would Lord Reith say? See - it's complex. Ultimately, the legal advice and cost will determine the BBC's actions. Any prudent organisation has insurance for crises like this. But BBC News needs to save tens of millions, and the rest of the BBC much more. At the best of times, every penny spent by the BBC has to be justified. During austerity, that gets ever harder. If the BBC fights, loses, and is seen to have wasted public funds, the current support from Fleet Street could switch to anger, and brutally fast.

"The parents of Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley want the boys to be able to access cannabis oil legally to control their seizures Doctors in the UK should have the option to prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products to patients with certain medical conditions, drugs experts have advised the government. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommends rules should be changed for these medications, if safe. It comes after high profile cases involvingchildren with severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil. The government must now agree on a definition for these products. The Council recommended that clinical trials be carried out urgently to improve understanding of medicinal cannabis products, as well as their safety and effectiveness. Its advice is in line with a recent review by the chief medical officer for England. Prof Dame Sally Davies said there was conclusive evidence of the therapeutic benefit of prescribing cannabis-based products for certain medical conditions. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was ""carefully considering"" both recommendations and would make a decision shortly. The Home Office recently grantedBilly CaldwellandAlfie Dingley, boys who have rare forms of epilepsy, a short-term licence to allow them access to cannabis oil, which their parents say helps to control their seizures. Cannabis for recreational use will remain illegal. The Council's advice is that only products meeting definitions decided on by the Home Office and the Department of Health will be moved out of schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 into schedule 2, which allows them to be prescribed by clinicians. Schedule 1 includes drugs not used for medical purposes, such as hallucinogenic drugs, raw opium and cannabis. The Council said there were still potential risks if cannabis-derived medicinal products were prescribed inappropriately and these needed to be carefully considered to avoid harm to patients. Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, chair of the ACMD, said: ""At present, cannabis-derived products can vary greatly in their composition, effectiveness and level of impurity. ""It is important that clinicians, patients and their families are confident that any prescribed medication is both safe and effective. ""The ACMD recommends that an appropriate definition be agreed by DHSC and MHRA promptly. ""Only products meeting this standard and definition should be given medicinal status."" It stressed that rules for synthetic cannabinoids, which are found in products such as 'Spice', would not be changed.

"The High Court ruling on Sir Cliff Richard's privacy case against the BBC has prompted reaction from media, police and friends of the singer. Here's what's being discussed. While the BBC has apologised to Sir Cliff Richard for the distress caused by coverage of the raid on his home, the ruling could have an impact on press freedom, its director of news said. Fran Unsworth admitted the case had had a ""very serious impact"" on Sir Cliff, adding there were things that could have been done differently. But, she noted, the judge stressed that even if no footage of the search had been broadcast, then ""the very naming of Sir Cliff would have been unlawful"". This video can not be played The BBC's director of news said she would be going through the whole judgement in detail ""This creates a significant shift against press freedom,"" said Ms Unsworth. ""This means police investigations and searches of people's homes could go unreported and unscrutinised. It will put decision-making about naming individuals in the hands of the police over the public's right to know. ""We don't believe this is compatible with liberty and press freedoms."" Ms Unsworth said there was ""an important principle at stake"", which is why the BBC is considering an appeal. Asked by a reporter outside court if she or Jonathan Munro, the BBC's head of newsgathering, intended to resign, she said it was a ""very long"" judgement and that the BBC had to ""take time to consider what lessons are to be learned"". There has been concern in the media over the ruling and the implications it could have for press freedom. The Society of Editors said,externalthat the judgement ""threatens the ability of the media as a whole to police the police"". Ian Murray, its executive director, said: ""The ruling to make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named is a major step and one that has worrying consequences for press freedom and the public's right to know."" He said making it unlawful to name someone under investigation is ""extreme"". ""Certainly, such a major change in the law should be debated in Parliament and not come into force following one case involving a high-profile celebrity,"" said Mr Murray. ""In many situations, the publishing of the name of someone under investigation has led to other witnesses and victims coming forward. We should also consider that the reverse is true. It is vital that the actions of the police should be kept under scrutiny in a free society and this change in the law will make that much harder."" Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman said the ruling was ""an atrocity for a free media"" and would ""dramatically restrict the freedom to report"". Allow Twitter content?

Sir Cliff said he was ""choked up"" and that the judgement was ""wonderful news"". His lawyer Gideon Benaim said the impact on Sir Cliff had been ""profound"". ""He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle,"" he said. ""Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case - and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law - Sir Cliff's motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what. ""His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through."" This video can not be played ""It's going to take a little while to get over the whole emotional factor"" On the matter of press freedom, Jon Oakley of Simkins law firm - which represented Sir Cliff - said: ""Where there is a genuine public interest in people being named - for example, where there is imminent risk or danger to the public - the press rightly continues to be free to identify the person being investigated. ""However, after very careful consideration, the judge found that any such public interest does not exist on the facts of this particular case. ""Therefore, rather than heralding any change in the law, we believe what this case represents is confirmation of what has already been the legal position for some time."" Paul Gambaccini spoke to reporters outside court after the ruling Paul Gambaccini, broadcaster and friend of Sir Cliff, said that when the singer found out about the raid he collapsed to the floor weeping, but that another friend had told him to fight the case. ""And he has fought it,"" said Mr Gambaccini. ""And he's fought it for three years, 11 months and four days. And now he's been vindicated."" Gloria Hunniford, speaking on ITV's Loose Women, revealed Sir Cliff had spent Â£4m of his own money on legal fees. ""I hope his life begins as of now,"" she said. ""Let's get on with what he does best."" Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative MP Anna Soubry called for a change in the law over naming suspects. Prime Minister Theresa May said in response that it was a ""difficult issue"" that needed ""careful judgement"". Chief Constable Stephen Watson of South Yorkshire Police accepted the judge's findings. He said: ""I particularly welcome Mr Justice Mann's findings that all South Yorkshire Police officers and staff were found to have acted entirely honestly and were credible and reliable witnesses. ""At a very early stage of these proceedings, we accepted and apologised to Sir Cliff Richard for the mistakes we made in our attempts to protect the integrity of the police investigation and the rights of the complainant, balanced against Sir Cliff Richard's privacy rights. ""I would like to take this opportunity to again offer our sincere apologies for the distress Sir Cliff Richard has suffered."" Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ""I welcome the judgement in this case and am sorry for the distress caused to Sir Cliff Richard over this difficult period of time. ""South Yorkshire Police admitted and acknowledged their mistakes, settling damages with Sir Cliff Richard out of court in 2017. ""I have also been assured by South Yorkshire Police, that they have implemented the five recommendations in the 2014 Trotter Review, an independent review into the disclosure of information to the BBC.""

"The BBC has agreed to pay Sir Cliff Richard Â£850,000 towards his legal costs within 14 days, following his privacy case against the corporation. A judge ruled the BBC infringed the singer's privacy in its reporting of a police raid on his home in 2014,awarding him Â£210,000in damages. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged as part of the investigation. The BBC sought leave to appealagainst the High Court ruling but the application was rejected. The corporation has apologised to Sir Cliff for the distress caused, but wanted permission to appeal, arguing the court judgement could threaten press freedom. The BBC will now decide whether or not to go directly to the Court of Appeal to seek permission to appeal. A BBC spokesperson said: ""This is a complex case and while we hadn't decided on whether to pursue an appeal, we sought permission today in order to keep all options open. ""We reiterate that we are very sorry to Sir Cliff for the distress caused and have no desire to prolong this case unnecessarily, but the ruling has raised significant questions for press freedom and we are considering the best way to address these."" The judge's findings had included that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while he was a suspect in the South Yorkshire Police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. Reaction to the Sir Cliff case BBC bosses 'should carry the can' Barrister Gavin Millar QC, leading the BBC legal team, told a hearing on Thursday it was ""appropriate"" for the corporation to pay legal fees incurred by Sir Cliff. The Â£850,000 may not be the final total for his legal fees, but Sir Cliff is being given it now to pay his lawyers. The singer's lawyer, barrister Justin Rushbrooke QC, did not give an overall figure for how much the case had cost his client, but Sir Cliff told the trial he had spent more than Â£3m. The BBC is also going to pay Â£315,000 to South Yorkshire Police for legal costs. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard v BBC - how did we get here? By Amol Rajan, BBC News media editor For the BBC, the decision whether to spend more money on this case is a difficult dilemma with high stakes. There are many factors to consider. First, will an appeal cause further distress to Sir Cliff? The corporation has said that it is sorry for the distress caused to him, so why extend the agony? Second, to fight this verdict is to keep it in the public eye. An appeal could create the possibility of more adverse publicity. Third, what are the chances of success? And finally, this is public money. Sir Cliff is commonly regarded as a national treasure. Why throw more of other people's money - ie licence-fee payers' incomes - at a case in which a national treasure is aggrieved? But what is the cost of not appealing? If the freedom of journalists is diminished as a result of editorial decisions made by the BBC, then not fighting this verdict could lead to resentment in Fleet Street, where the BBC lacks friends. And then there is the principle. Many journalists, inside the corporation and beyond, really do feel that journalism would be damaged. Read more from Amol Mr Justice Mann ruled in favour of Sir Cliff, 77, following the trial in London. He concluded the BBC's coverage - which involved a helicopter filming the search at Sir Cliff's Berkshire home - had been a ""very serious"" invasion of privacy. Police officers had been investigating an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in 1985, when he was a child. Last week, Mr Justice Mann awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages after the BBCsubmitted its coverage of the raid for an award. The BBC must pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police 35%. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force. On Thursday, the BBC's Mr Millar outlined his permission to appeal arguments in a written document, saying there was a ""compelling reason"" for the case to be heard and that it had a ""real prospect"" of success. It was rejected by Mr Justice Mann on all counts, however. The BBC's director of news has said the ruling could have an impact on press freedom. Speaking outside court last week, Fran Unsworth admitted the case had had a ""very serious impact"" on Sir Cliff, and there were things that could have been done differently. But she stressed that even if no footage of the search had been broadcast, ""the very naming of Sir Cliff would have been unlawful"", according to the judge's ruling. ""This creates a significant shift against press freedom,"" Ms Unsworth said. High stakes for BBC What's the reaction to the Sir Cliff case?

" Matt Merry can’t recall the exact words his mother used to tell him he was HIV-positive. He just remembers not knowing how to react, not at first, not in front of his mum. She had sat him down at a table in the back room of their home in Rugby to break the news. Matt was 12 years old. He’d had the virus for four years, his mum explained. An injection he’d received to treat haemophilia, the bleeding disorder he was affected by, had been contaminated with it. This was 1986, at the height of the Aids epidemic, and an HIV diagnosis was perceived as a death sentence. After the first signs of infection started to show, he would probably have two years to live, the doctors told his parents. That night, as Matt lay in bed with the lights out, the numbness he'd felt all day began to ebb away. The enormity of what he'd learned finally started to dawn on him. All he knew of HIV and Aids was TV footage of skeletal-looking young men, their bodies covered in sores, wasting away in hospital wards, and he started to cry. “From that point onwards, for the rest of my teenage years, I had this stopwatch hanging over my head - and at any minute someone could push that button and start this two-year countdown until I waste away and die,” he says.There was something else Matt’s mum had said to him, too - he wasn't to tell anyone. Not friends, not teachers, initially not even his younger brother. The next time he went to school he was carrying a secret that he couldn't share. In 1986, HIV and Aids were the subjects of an all-pervasive, visceral fear. In the media, the disease was largely associated with groups such as drug users and gay men, who were routinely stigmatised at the time. Matt had heard of homes that were daubed with graffiti - “AIDS SCUM” and so on – when a rumour spread that someone living there had the condition. The panic only intensified the following year, when the government released its infamous “tombstone” adverts, which depicted Aids as an ominous, deadly presence. Looking back, Matt thinks his parents made the right decision about keeping quiet. “It wasn’t really an option to let anyone know,” he says. Sometimes other pupils gave him stick about being a haemophiliac, and he can't imagine what would have happened if news of his HIV diagnosis had got out. It had emerged that thousands had been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products, and Matt had heard of schools where parents had pulled out their children on learning that there was a haemophiliac in the class. But the burden of secrecy weighed heavily on him. “It’s so lonely going through that and experiencing that on your own - not being able to talk to anyone about it, not being able to discuss it.” He was never offered any professional support or counselling. There were no psychologists or therapists to help him cope. “I guess I could have talked to my mum or dad or brother - but it’s almost like it was so upsetting at the time that I didn’t want to talk about it, because I knew I’d just break down in tears, so I just shut it away and got on with it.” To his friends and classmates, everything seemed normal. No-one knew what was going through his head. To him, it seemed a certainty that he’d be dead by the time he was 20. He could never have a girlfriend, let alone marry or have children. His family had nurtured ambitions for him - his dad was an engineer at the Rolls Royce plant in nearby Coventry, and both parents wanted their son to do well at school and go to university. But after he learned he was HIV-positive - he would later find out that he had been infected with hepatitis C too - Matt stopped trying at school. What was the point? “Why spend all that time revising and doing homework when I’m not actually going to have a career or anything?” he reasoned. Without realising it, Matt had been caught up in what's been called the biggest scandal in NHS history - one that has resulted in the deaths of at least 2,883 haemophiliacs in the UK, according to campaigners. It's feared that tens of thousands of non-haemophiliacs could have been infected via blood transfusions, too. He’d been diagnosed as a toddler with severe haemophilia, meaning his blood was slow to clot and he would bleed for longer than other children. This, in turn, meant Matt would bruise easily and cuts would take longer to repair. Bleeds could be extremely painful and restricted his mobility - blood would fill the cavities of his joints, which made moving them all but impossible. His parents wouldn’t let him climb trees or have a BMX bicycle. Haemophilia also meant Matt could never achieve his ambition of becoming a pilot with the RAF. But during the 1970s and 80s, a new treatment for haemophiliacs became available. Injections of proteins called factor concentrates - usually Factor VIII, as in Matt’s case - helped clot their blood. It was made from donated blood plasma, and there was so much demand for it that the NHS began importing it from abroad, notably the US. Now, instead of going into hospital every time he bled, Matt had a supply of Factor VIII at home - at first, his mum would inject him, and then he learned to do it himself. He’d go on summer camps in North Wales with other young haemophiliacs, accompanied by doctors equipped with supplies of Factor VIII, and the boys could play outdoors safe in the knowledge that they’d be treated if they fell and injured themselves. But unknown to Matt and his family, much of the imported American Factor VIII was made using blood plasma donated by prison inmates and drug addicts, who were high-risk groups for viruses like HIV and hepatitis C. In many cases they had been paid for it. And because the factor products were made in huge vats from the plasma of tens of thousands of people, if just one donation was infected that would be enough to contaminate the whole batch. Warnings about imported Factor VIII had been raised as early as 1974, and the government said it would make the UK self-sufficient in factor concentrates within three years – but it didn’t. As the Aids crisis unfolded in the 1980s, the Department of Health was warned again in writing that US blood products should be withdrawn, but it wasn’t until 1986 - 12 years after concerns were first raised - that this was advice was finally heeded. When Matt’s mother was told that her son had been infected with HIV, she hadn't even realised he’d been tested for it. She’d fastidiously kept records of the batch numbers of the Factor VIII he’d been given, though. She looked back through them to 1982, when he’d been given a series of injections of proteins produced by an American company. She didn't have any school photos of him taken that year because the photographer came on one of the many days when he was ill. At school, Matt had a tight circle of close friends, but none of them knew why his grades were plummeting. He did the bare minimum for his GCSEs, scraping through with five passes. He put even less effort into his A-levels: “I just spent the two years mucking around, having fun with my mates.” In the end, he had one E grade to show for it. But despite the dire predictions that he would die within two years, Matt still appeared to be healthy, apart from his haemophilia. On 19 April 1990, just after Matt turned 16, he was assessed by a psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital. “He believes there is a 50/50 chance he will develop Aids,” the doctor wrote in his report. “He tries not to think about the future and when he does feel upset he tries to distract himself.” Matt, the report continued, had a “strong psychological defence system” but this was “easily penetrated at which point he becomes clearly distressed”. It was likely that even if he did not develop Aids in the next few years, Matt would “suffer major emotional difficulties”, the psychiatrist said. “It will be difficult for him to make satisfactory relationships with people of the opposite sex, because of the very real danger of cross-infection,” he went on. “He is already worried about this and distressed at the fact that he will not be able to have children.” It was to his parents’ credit, the report concluded, that he was coping so well. Around this time, Matt began smoking cannabis. “I just thought I’d give it a go - you know, what harm’s it going to do? The damage has already been done.” From there he moved on to speed and ecstasy. It was now the early 1990s, and Matt threw himself into the rave scene. He’d stay up all night, off his face, and then “come back home to mum and dad the next morning, eyeballs as wide as saucers, and go to bed for the rest of the day”. His parents didn’t realise what was going on at first. Then one day he came home from college and his dad pulled out a stash box filled with speed and cannabis. They’d found it in Matt's bedroom. “What’s this?” his dad asked. His mum was in tears. Matt felt like the floor had fallen out of the room. His parents wanted to know why he’d been taking drugs. “I said: ‘Well, why not? You know, I might not have long to live. I want to try and enjoy and experience as much as I can before I die.’” It wasn’t an easy point to argue with. One night, when he was 17 or 18, Matt had been out drinking in town. He was walking home with a friend when something compelled him, for the first time ever, to tell someone outside his immediate family that he had HIV. The friend was shocked, but he was understanding. “It was a case of: ‘Well, OK, it is what it is, but you’re still my mate.’” They walked past the friend’s house, and then past Matt’s house, and they carried on walking and talking it over until three in the morning. The relief washed over Matt. Over the next three or four years he began telling his closest friends, individually. As time went on it became easier - he never had a negative reaction from any of them. “What does it mean?” they’d ask. “How are you? Are you going to be all right?” But on each occasion, he anxiously weighed up whether or not he could risk sharing his secret. “I always very carefully considered who I told,” he says. It was always a case of: “Can I trust this person?” After school, Matt signed up at a further education college in Leamington Spa. He didn't see much point getting a job, and it was another excuse to muck about for a while. He spent two years there not turning up to lectures very much, and left with no qualifications to show for it. Now he was 20. Many of his friends were at university in Birmingham, so he moved there, signed on and concentrated on partying. But he sensed that he was being left behind. His friends were moving on with their lives, earning degrees, getting together with girlfriends, and Matt wasn’t. There wasn't one single moment when it dawned on him, but slowly, over time, he began thinking: I’ve had this since I was eight years old, and I was always told I’d have two years to live. ""Well, what if it’s not two years? What if it’s longer?"" It had never occurred to him that he might reach 40, let alone 50 or 60. But if his health continued to hold out he was destined for a dead-end job. He realised he had to do something in case he was still alive in 10 years’ time. He applied for a diploma course at the University of Central England and was accepted. In his first year, for the first time since his HIV diagnosis, he worked hard at it. “That was a bit of a turning point for me,” he says. His efforts were rewarded with good grades. “It was like: I can actually do this.” Eventually, the diploma led to a degree. In the meantime, he travelled regularly to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to have his CD4 cells checked – these are usually killed off by the HIV virus, but his count was still normal. Each time they'd give him his results, he’d feel relieved. He’d treat himself to a CD or a video to celebrate. But although HIV had been the focus of all his worries, the hepatitis C he had also contracted from the contaminated Factor VIII was starting to affect his liver. A biopsy revealed it was scarred and damaged. The doctors suggested he go on a 12-month course of powerful drugs, ribavirin and interferon, in an effort to get rid of the virus. Matt knew from fellow haemophiliacs that the drugs were “pretty nasty”. Some of his friends had had to quit after a few weeks because of the side effects. At first, taking the drugs was like having the flu. “You’d be curled up in bed, shivering and sweating, for 24 hours after an injection, and you’d have to repeat the process three times a week.” After a while, the side effects faded away, and at the end of the 12 months, the doctors had amazing news for him - he was clear of hepatitis C. Matt was on the move. Australia was the furthest away he could go from Rugby, from everyone he knew and his entire life up until then. And that’s where he ended up. “I think I went travelling to get away from myself,” he says. “Fresh people that don’t know me. I could be someone different. I could forget, essentially, what I’d been through over the past few years and the emotional baggage.” He moved into a two-bedroom house in Sydney with seven other travellers. A close bond quickly formed between them all. They’d work all week and party at the weekends. Telling people he had HIV seemed easier here. He would only be in their company for a short time. They didn’t know his friends or anything about his life. He was still careful about who he spoke to about it, though their reactions didn’t matter so much to him. “I think within me there was an urge to just get it out,” he says. But for the first time, he started to contemplate the idea of having a relationship. Because of his HIV status, the notion had always been a difficult one for him. His parents had drummed into him the imperative to tell prospective partners and give them a choice and it was a far more daunting prospect than telling close friends. “I met some girls out there and had relationships - brief sort of holiday things, really,” he says. The first girl he told - they’d met travelling - didn’t handle the news well. He’d told her before they first slept together, but later, as the information sank in, her feelings about it began to change. “I think she sort of lived with it for a while,” he says. Then one evening they were both in someone else’s flat with a group of friends. “I just remember, she was sort of crying and her mates were comforting her and so on, and it just went tits up from there.” After he returned to the UK from Australia, just before Christmas 2000, a thought began to occur to Matt - he might be around for a long time. “I think travelling really helped, it made me see all this stuff, meet all these different people, and I could be… not someone else, but I was free of everything,” he says - including free of preconceptions about HIV. It helped that, with the arrival of anti-retroviral  treatments, other people stopped regarding HIV as an automatic death sentence. In 2003, Matt travelled to Bournemouth for a friend's stag do. In one bar, he found he'd been separated from his friends, so he struck up a conversation with a group of young women who were standing near him. He hit it off with one of them in particular. Before Matt left to rejoin the stag party, he swapped numbers with her. They kept in touch and soon they were dating. Early in the relationship, he mentioned he had HIV and braced himself for a rejection. “It didn’t faze her,” he says. “At first I didn’t know if it had sunk in, what I’d told her. It was just like,phew.” By 2008 they were married. “It’s not bothered her whatsoever.” Liz Hooper had two husbands. The same NHS scandal killed them both.Read her story: If he'd never imagined it would be possible for him to meet someone, then having children seemed completely off the agenda. “I thought it was physically, medically, impossible,” he says. But one of his childhood friends, a haemophiliac who had also attended the camps in North Wales, told Matt he had become a father thanks to a technique called sperm-washing, a form of assisted conception. Matt inquired about it and was dumbfounded to be told by a consultant that, because his viral load was still undetectable, it would be safe for him and his wife to have a baby naturally - without sperm-washing. “I couldn't quite understand what they were saying,” he says. “I was like: ‘Do you not know what I’ve gone through the last 15 or 20 years? Do you think I’m going to subject anyone else to that?'” However low the risk of passing on the virus was, it wasn’t one he was willing to take. The NHS funded three cycles of sperm-washing, which led to the birth of a son. Matt and his wife applied for assisted conception to have a second child, but this was refused. Despite a supporting letter from Matt’s HIV consultant pointing out that he had contracted HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products suppliedby the NHS, they were told these were not “exceptional circumstances”. They had to pay for the treatment that gave them their second son. Becoming a father was life-changing for Matt. And now, seeing his own boys approach the age at which he was infected brings home the enormity of what happened to him. “It’s the only time I get emotional about the whole thing,” he says. “It makes me so angry. It’s almost a displaced anger - I don’t feel as if it was done to me, it’s as if it was done to my kids.” If he was told today that his sons had two years to live, he says, “God, I don’t know what I would do, so God knows how my parents felt.” After decades of pressure from campaigners, a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal is getting under way – but while Matt is glad it’s taking place, he feels it’s long overdue. “There’s an uproar about the tragedy of Grenfell, and rightly so, but because we’re dying quietly, individually, behind closed doors, no-one knows that,” he says. Matt looks at where he is today with amazement. His hepatitis C has gone and his viral loads of HIV are still undetectable – he’s never had to take anti-retrovirals. Of about 1,250 haemophiliacs infected with both hepatitis C and HIV due to the scandal, according to the campaign group Tainted Blood, fewer than 250 are still alive. “It really is, in terms of health outcomes, like winning the lottery,” he says. He has a family and a home in London - he thinks his career is several years behind where it should be, “but actually I'm not too hard on myself because look what I’ve done, I mean, I’m here and I've done it off my own back.” He knows that many others haven’t been so fortunate. He’s hopeful that the forthcoming inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal will deliver justice, but he won’t allow himself to gettoohopeful. “Successive governments, Labour and Conservative and Liberal Democrat, have failed to address this issue and tried to put it on the back burner or just wait until we’re dead, until it goes away,” he says. Despite the vast number of victims, the scandal commands relatively little attention because of the legacy of stigma around HIV and Aids, he believes – which is why he is telling his story. “I'm pleased with where my life is at the moment - I’ve got a brilliant family, a wonderful wife, two wonderful kids,” Matt says. “I’ve got everything to be thankful for. But I shouldn’t have to be thankful for that.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,2.205077e-06

Back in 2016 his presidential campaign barred publications from his rallies after they ran critical articles. Perhaps some thought that, as president, Mr Trump would behave differently. But on this, as in countless other areas, President Trump operates just like Candidate Trump. In fact, hostilities may be growing. The president bashes the media in speeches and tweets. He refers to a growing number of outlets as ""enemies of the American people"". He has refused to call on certain reporters during media availability. His press office has limited access to some smaller briefings. Now an individual reporter has been blocked from a major presidential event - for shouting questions even though the president often answers such call-outs. The White House says it is frustrated by what it views as reflexively hostile media coverage. It points to instances where reporters got stories wrong or amplified inaccurate reports on social media. There may be a larger strategy at play, however. Mr Trump often seems intent on needling the media into righteous outrage, focusing their attention inward instead of on stories that could damage his administration. The public at large doesn't have much sympathy for the journalists these days. The president may feel that a conflict with the media pack is one he can win. Ms Sanders said a reporter, whom she does not name, has refused to leave after shouting questions, and ""was not welcome to participate in the next event"" - although colleagues from her network could do so.

"Hoping to be a ninja? Sorry, but the Japanese city of Iga is not hiring A Japanese city has been forced to clarify it is not in fact recruiting ninjas, following reports that it was facing a shortage of skilled assassins. Local officials in Iga, which styles itself as the birthplace of ninja-dom, had received a flood of applications from around the world. Butthey said in a statement (in Japanese) that they were not officially hiring any,external, ""so please be careful"". The mix-up apparently began with a report by a US broadcaster. On 16 July, National Public Radio (NPR) reported in its The Indicator from Planet Money podcast that Iga was struggling to expand its ninja-based tourism strategy because of a labour shortage. ""Iga will build a second ninja museum [but faces a] labour shortage.... [which] also extends to ninjas,"" said journalist Sally Herships in the NPR podcast. ""There's a ninja shortage, or to be accurate, a ninja-performer shortage."" Japanese police arrest 74-year-old ninja thief suspect Meet the last of the Japanese ninjas Japan's ninjas heading for extinction Ms Herships also added that ninja performers in Japan could make anywhere between $23,000 and $85,000 a year, though she did not say that there were immediate vacancies for ninjas available. The NPR podcast fuelled a frenzy of online reports, with many suggesting that the city was looking to hire ninjas at a salary of $85,000 a year. NPR later said that a summary of its podcast had been ""incorrectly stated"", and that its story may have been misunderstood. The podcast by NPR said that Iga faced a 'ninja shortage' NPR had posted a summary which said that Iga ""is facing a serious problem, there aren't enough people training to be ninjas, not even for $85k a year"". ""That characterisation was incorrect,"" an NPR spokesman told the BBC. ""After the story was posted online, portions of the story may have been misconstrued on social media or abridged in other media outlets."" But  those reports led at least 115 ninja hopefuls from 23 countries to contact Iga officials, enquiring about possible jobs. ""Most were questions about whether we were really hiring, but there were a few that begged us to employ them and tried to promote themselves,"" tourism strategy official Motoyoshi Shimai told Reuters news agency. ""Some had real confidence in their bodies and strength."" Iga has wasted no time in capitalising on the confusion, turning it to its advantage. In its statement, it extolled the virtues of its ""splendid tourist attractions including facilities about ninjas"". Besides its first ninja museum, the central Japanese city also has several ninja costume rental shops and holds a yearly ninja festival where visitors can ""throw ninja stars and use blowguns"", according to Iga's tourism website. ""Iga is not officially hiring but this is where ninjas originated,"" the city said in its statement. ""You can feel and experience their history throughout the city, so please visit us.""

"This video can not be played Greek fires: Survivors confront defence minister over response Greek Defence Minister Panos Kammenos has told the BBC illegal construction contributed to one of the country's worst-ever wildfire disasters. He said building by residents between wooded areas was a ""crime"" that had resulted in blocking escape routes. Mr Kammenos was confronted by angry locals as he visited areas devastated by fires east of Athens this week. At least 83 people died and search teams fear they will find further victims as dozens more are missing. Dozens of rescue workers searching a cliffside in the seaside town of Mati on Thursday found more human remains. Many of the victims were caught close to the cliff as the flames spread rapidly, whipped up by winds as high as 120km/h (75mph).  Relatives have been providing their DNA to help identify the bodies of the victims. Some 60 people are still being treated in hospital, 11 of them in intensive care. Arriving in the village of Mati, where many people died, Mr Kammenos was surrounded by residents who accused him of abandoning them. The seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, has been the hardest-hit community ""You let people burn for no reason. You left us to the mercy of God,"" a woman told the minister, who was accompanied by the local mayor and the head of the military, One man told the BBC he had reached the fire station to ask for help, and found firefighters unaware of the blaze. Another resident complained that people had been advised to dive into the sea to escape, when most of the elderly were unable to reach the sea in the first place. Many of the survivors were saved by the sea, but dozens of victims were unable to reach the water. Stench and smoke in Mati Aerial images reveal devastation The photos that explain the world's wildfires British man in hospital after Greek fires Mr Kammenos, a combative figure who leads the nationalist Independent Greeks, rejected accusations that the government had failed to protect its citizens. This video can not be played ""The flames were chasing us into the water"" - survivor The actions of some residents had closed the roads to the beach, he argued. ""This is a crime from the past,"" he said. ""This coast of Athens, all these properties, the majority are without a licence, and they have occupied the coast without rules."" Rafina Mayor Evangelos Bournous said one in four houses had been completely destroyed by the fire, while 50% more were partially damaged. A satellite map of the area revealed the scale of the fire damage, showing that more than half the 12,760 acres affected were residential areas. The mayor defended the role of the military, arguing that if the army had not been able to stop the fire spreading, it would have razed the entire area. EU satellite service Copernicus produced a map showing the almost complete devastation of residential areas With many people still unaccounted for, a harrowing account emerged from the head of the Greek forestry federation, Georgos Papadias, who said firefighters had focused their resources on a separate fire to the west of Athens, leaving the East Attica coast exposed. Mr Papadias had been in the village of Kokkino Limanaki, on the southern edge of Mati when the fire struck. It was like a horror movie, he said, with injured and elderly pleading for help, and he was not being in a position to do anything, No alarm was sounded to warn residents or tourists, and no evacuation was organised from the coastal resorts of Maki and Kokkino Limanaki and the village of Neos Voutzas just inland. But once the fire crossed the main road through the area, Marathon Avenue, residents had no means of escape. Greek newspapers complained that residents could have no confidence in official organisations as civil protection was non-existent, and no lessons had been learned since the last devastating fires to hit Greece, in 2007. Mr Papadias spoke of cars blocking the roads as he tried to escape. He said he had lost neighbours to the disaster and a friend was in a grave condition in hospital. Among the missing are twin nine-year-old girls Vassiliki and Sofia Philippopoulou, who were with their grandparents near Mati at the time of the fire. The girls' father said he thought he had seen them being rescued in footage broadcast by Greek TV. However, the children in the video turned out to be different girls.

"The current heatwave could become the new normal for UK summers by 2040 because of climate change, MPs say. The Environmental Audit Committee warns of7,000 heat-related deaths every year in the UK by 2050,externalif the government doesn't act quickly. Higher temperatures put some people at increased risk of dying from cardiac, kidney and respiratory diseases. The MPs say ministers must act to protect people - especially with an ageing population in the UK. Scientists differ on whether the current global rash of heatwaves is definitely caused by climate change. But they broadly agree that future heatwaves will be hotter and more frequent thanks to carbon emissions. The MPs highlight a warning from the Met Office that UK summer temperatures could regularly reach 38.5C by the 2040s. The government says it is committed to cutting carbon emissions, although it is not on track to meet its targets. The MPs say current plans will not stop buildings overheating, and ministers should be smarter about heat-proofing the UK. Tougher rules are needed to ensure homes and transport networks can deal with extreme heat. And local councils should plant trees and keep green spaces to provide cool air. During the 2003 heatwave, excess deaths in nursing homes in parts of the UK rose by 42%. The MPs want hospitals and care homes inspected to check they can cope with scorching heat. Met Office advice to stay out of sun In Pictures: The dramatic effect of the UK heatwave Committee chair Mary Creagh said: ""Heatwaves threaten health, wellbeing and productivity. ""The government must stop playing pass-the-parcel with local councils and the NHS, and develop a strategy to protect our ageing population from this increasing risk."" This video can not be played Why is it so hot at the moment? In a densely populated city, temperatures are higher. Homes built in the 1960s and 1970s present a particular risk, as can flats with windows that are small, hard to open or face the same way. The committee complains there is no regulation to prevent overheating in buildings. It wants the government to stop supporting the building of modular homes, which are factory-made then bolted together. It also calls for shading structures on buildings. Following the heatwave in August 2003, statisticians linked 2,091 deaths to the unusually high temperatures. Heat isn't a cause that appears on anyone's death certificate. So how do we measure the death-toll of a heatwave? Excess mortality figures are arrived at by comparing the death rate in a given period to the average for that period in previous years. We don't know that heat was a factor in all of those deaths - just that there were that many more deaths than the average for the same period over the previous five years. Death rates in summer tend to be relatively stable so this was an unusual spike. Researchers used this 2,091 figure as a baseline when calculating how many more people could die in heatwaves by 2050. They estimated there would be an increase of more than 200%, giving the 7,000 figure. The Office for National Statistics doesn't regularly look at how many deaths are linked to hot weather, but it does regularly publish excess winter mortality data. More people die in winter than in summer because of cold weather and higher rates of infectious illnesses such as flu. In the winter of 2016-17, there were 34,300 excess deaths compared with the death rate in the summer. The report says only 50% of UK motorways and major roads are surfaced with material that can withstand the kind of summer temperatures the country is beginning to experience regularly. During June's heatwave,railway tracks buckledcausing cancellations and delays. High heat reduces productivity. Workers arriving sweating to the office take time before they're ready to do the job. People working outside find themselves doing less and needing more breaks. The committee says Public Health England should tell employers to relax dress codes and allow flexible working in heatwaves. Labourers Peter Wackett, Jake Phillips and Luke Cahalane say they sweat lots in their overalls when it is hot Are your work clothes making you hotter? Heatwave exposes 17th Century garden Maximum workplace temperatures should also be introduced, especially for physical work. In schools, head teachers should be advised about safe classroom temperatures. And they should relax school uniform policy during hot weather. A recent study suggested wealthy private schools that could afford air conditioning would increase the relative exam success of their pupils during summer heat. Cities can be up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside because hard surfaces absorb heat during the day and give out heat at night. This is the heat island effect. If people get too hot in bed, it prevents them recovering from the previous day's heat. Yet the government's planning framework makes no mention of the heat island effect. And ministers withdrew funding for local authority climate change adaptation officers, who were working on the issue. The report calls for towns and cities to be adapted to more frequent heatwaves. Police horses take a drink from fountains in Green Park There have been consistent demands for water companies to store more water, especially in dry south-east England, and to plug leaks. New homes should have to use water more efficiently, MPs say. Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change, said: ""Water shortages are a concern. We can expect greater water deficits across the country, including in cooler wetter areas like north-west England. ""The area of land well suited to the production of water-intensive crops, such as rain-fed potatoes, could decline by over 80% by the 2050s."" Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Staying safe and cool in UK heatwaves The UK is still far off the 1976 heatwave, which saw temperatures of 32C and over for 15 consecutive days The committee says the government's heatwave alert system runs only from June to September, so vulnerable people will not be warned about unseasonal heatwaves. The MPs heard that alerts are put out only if approximately 30Â°C is reached, even though Public Health England said heat-related deaths began at upwards of 25Â°C. In the UK, many more preventable deaths happen because of cold weather than hot weather, but the government has failed to deliver its targets for insulating homes. If the UK's winters get warmer, as generally predicted, winter deaths will be reduced. But in a year like this one, the UK has suffered extremes of cold and heat. Both heat-related and cold-related health burdens in future will be amplified by population ageing. Charities point out that the UK's challenges from future heatwaves will be dwarfed by those in poor nations, which haven't caused the climate problem. A study,externalby Prof Richard Tol, at the University of Sussex, suggests poorer countries are likely to see their economic growth slowed because they depend on agriculture and outdoor work. His study says nations with hot climates will need economies three times larger than cooler countries if they are to withstand significant temperature rises. He says policymakers must consider poverty reduction as a crucial element of climate policy. An official told BBC News the government would ""carefully consider"" the report and would keep taking ""robust action to ensure our country is resilient and prepared"". The ""long-term plan for climate change adaptation"" will see work and investment to protect food and water supplies, businesses and communities, the official said.

"There is a 90-minute wait for check-in with no facilities and a four-hour wait after that ""Unprecedented"" high temperatures have been blamed for delays to cross-Channel rail services leaving customers waiting for more than five hours in 30C heat. Air conditioning problems meant some carriages could not be used, which led to the delays, Eurotunnel said. People voicing their frustration online tweeted pictures of the queues and children and pets getting hosed down. Thousands of tickets have also been cancelled for Friday, for passengers returning that day or Saturday.

"This video can not be played Mary Ellis said she had flown ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war One of the last living female World War Two pilots, Mary Ellis, has died aged 101 at her home on the Isle of Wight. Mrs Ellis was a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) and delivered Spitfires and bombers to the front line during the conflict. She said she had flown ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war, before moving to the Isle of Wight in 1950 to take charge of Sandown Airport. ATA secretary John Webster described Mrs Ellis as an ""amazing"" person. While she was commonly known as the last-surviving female pilot from the war, in fact there are three others. Mr Webster said that one, Eleanor Wadsworth, lives in Bury St Edmunds, another, Nancy Stratford, lives in the US and the other, Jaye Edwards, lives in Canada. Obituary: Mary Ellis the air pioneer WW2 Spitfire pilot given island freedom Mary Ellis turns 100 Mary Ellis, then Mary Wilkins, joined the ATA in 1941 after hearing an advertisement for women pilots on BBC radio. She said at the time they were known as the ""Glamour Girls"", adding: ""There were plenty of escorts around."" Mrs Ellis continued to attend events linked to the RAF Mary Ellis served from 1941 until the end of the war She married Don Ellis, a fellow pilot, in 1961, and continued to live in their marital home beside the runway at Sandown after his death in 2009. Speaking at a surprise party in 2017 for her 100th birthday - held at the airport - Mrs Ellis said the Spitfire had always been her favourite aircraft. ""I love it, it's everybody's favourite,"" she said. ""I think it's a symbol of freedom."" Tributes have been paid to Mrs Ellis by fellow pilots, including Red Arrow flier Mike Ling. He posted on Twitter that she was a ""legend of the Air Transport Auxiliary"". ""I hope you are enjoying a well-earned sherry up there with Joy Lofthouse [a fellow ATA pilot] again.""

"Imran Khan giving his televised speech from his home on the outskirts of Islamabad Former cricketer Imran Khan has claimed victory in Pakistan's election, amid accusations of vote rigging by rivals. In a television address, he said: ""We were successful and we were given a mandate."" His PTI party is still expected to fall short of an overall majority, so it would have to seek coalition partners in order to form a government. Campaigning has been marred by violence. On voting day a bomb killed 31 people at a polling station. Mr Khan, the charismatic patrician who captained Pakistan to a World Cup victory in 1992, has long shed his celebrity playboy image and has recently faced accusations that his election challenge was benefiting from military interference in the nuclear-armed republic. An official confirmation of the vote is still to come. Can Imran Khan change Pakistan? Why Pakistan's election matters The party of disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has rejected the results, as have a host of smaller parties, all alleging vote-rigging and manipulation. The election has been seen as a contest between Mr Khan's PTI party and Mr Sharif's PML-N, with the party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the historically liberal PPP, widely expected to come third. In his address, Mr Khan said: ""I think this has been the clearest, fairest election Pakistan has ever had."" He added that he would investigate any claims to the contrary. He also appealed to his rivals to join hands with him to develop Pakistan. And he vowed to hold talks with India to seek a resolution to the dispute over the Kashmir region, a key flashpoint between the nuclear-armed countries. He also called for ""mutually beneficial"" ties with the United States, despite being an outspoken critic of that country's anti-terrorism measures in the region, such as drone strikes. Figures from the Electoral Commission show Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party has 116 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies being contested. Earlier, unofficial projections from Pakistan's Dawn Newspaper reported the PTI on 120. A total of 137 seats is required for a majority. This election will mark only the second time that a civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term in Pakistan. The turnout has been estimated at between 50% and 55% out of 106 million registered voters, AFP reports. On Thursday, Dawn said the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had raised questions over the voting process. ""The commission received complaints that in many areas women were not allowed to vote,"" the newspaper reported. Mr Sharif, who won the last election, is in jail after a scandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak, but remained a looming figure in this election. He appointed his brother, Shahbaz Sharif, as head of the PML-N, to run in his absence. Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's three-time PM Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Heir to a political dynasty Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a 29-year-old son of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, ran for the PPP, after becoming party chairman when he was still a student at Oxford University in the UK. Mr Khan, who first entered politics in 1996 but struggled for years on the political sidelines, now styles himself as a pious, populist, anti-poverty reformer. ""God has given me a chance to come to power to implement that ideology, which I started 22 years ago,"" he said in his speech. He also said he would not live in the prime minister's usual grand residence. ""Whatever the ruling elite has been doing in Pakistan so far with the taxpayers' money, I'm promising you today I will change all of that."" The cricket hero turned politician The 65-year-old campaigned on a message of anti-corruption and vowed to take on Pakistan's entrenched political dynasties. But his views on Islamist militancy will be scrutinised if he becomes prime minister - he has criticised some of the Taliban's violence but last year his party's government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province gave $3m (Â£2.3m) to the notorious Haqqania madrassa, headed by a man known as the ""father of the Taliban"". This video can not be played Five things to know about Imran Khan (from 2018) Before the election Mr Khan told the BBC that if he were to be elected, his initial focus would be on the economy. Pakistan's currency, the rupee, has declined by 20%. Inflation is on the rise and the trade deficit widening. Exports such as textiles have taken a hit from cheaper products by regional competitors, including China. Analysts say the new government may need to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the country's second bailout since 2013. The BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad says tough decisions that could entail curbs on spending will be easier in a government Mr Khan is able to dominate. However, if his rivals continue to reject the results, and even potentially launch the kind of street protests Mr Khan did while in opposition, the country could face political instability. Pakistan has a population of nearly 200 million, and is a nuclear-armed rival to India, a key developing economy and one of the world's largest Muslim-majority nations. The country has been ruled on and off by the military during its 71-year history, so this election is significant because it is considered the country's second consecutive democratic transition. Both the run-up to the vote, and the vote count itself, have been highly controversial. Ahead of the elections, the PML-N complained of a targeted crackdown by the security establishment, with the alleged help of the courts, in favour of the PTI party. The Pakistani military denied interfering in politics. Independent media, meanwhile, say there have been blatant attempts to muzzle them, whilethe human rights commission has said there are ""ample grounds"" to question the legitimacy of the polls,external. Who are the 'angels' and the 'electables'? Viewpoint: Pakistan's dirtiest election in years Fears of 'creeping coup' in Pakistan After the polls closed on Wednesday, several political groups alleged that vote rigging was taking place in polling stations - something denied by election officials. Wednesday's attack in Quetta has been claimed by the Islamic State group Representatives from several parties said that their polling agents were expelled from polling stations during vote count and were denied certified copies of results - breaching election procedures. Analysts have also highlighted unusual delays in the announcement of unofficial results in dozens of constituencies, especially in the crucial province of Punjab which has been a stronghold of PML-N. Election officials say delays in releasing the results are simply down to failures in the electronic reporting system and that votes are now being counted manually. Can Imran Khan change Pakistan?

"The current heatwave could become the new normal for UK summers by 2040 because of climate change, MPs say. The Environmental Audit Committee warns of7,000 heat-related deaths every year in the UK by 2050,externalif the government doesn't act quickly. Higher temperatures put some people at increased risk of dying from cardiac, kidney and respiratory diseases. The MPs say ministers must act to protect people - especially with an ageing population in the UK. Scientists differ on whether the current global rash of heatwaves is definitely caused by climate change. But they broadly agree that future heatwaves will be hotter and more frequent thanks to carbon emissions. The MPs highlight a warning from the Met Office that UK summer temperatures could regularly reach 38.5C by the 2040s. The government says it is committed to cutting carbon emissions, although it is not on track to meet its targets. The MPs say current plans will not stop buildings overheating, and ministers should be smarter about heat-proofing the UK. Tougher rules are needed to ensure homes and transport networks can deal with extreme heat. And local councils should plant trees and keep green spaces to provide cool air. During the 2003 heatwave, excess deaths in nursing homes in parts of the UK rose by 42%. The MPs want hospitals and care homes inspected to check they can cope with scorching heat. Met Office advice to stay out of sun In Pictures: The dramatic effect of the UK heatwave Committee chair Mary Creagh said: ""Heatwaves threaten health, wellbeing and productivity. ""The government must stop playing pass-the-parcel with local councils and the NHS, and develop a strategy to protect our ageing population from this increasing risk."" This video can not be played Why is it so hot at the moment? In a densely populated city, temperatures are higher. Homes built in the 1960s and 1970s present a particular risk, as can flats with windows that are small, hard to open or face the same way. The committee complains there is no regulation to prevent overheating in buildings. It wants the government to stop supporting the building of modular homes, which are factory-made then bolted together. It also calls for shading structures on buildings. Following the heatwave in August 2003, statisticians linked 2,091 deaths to the unusually high temperatures. Heat isn't a cause that appears on anyone's death certificate. So how do we measure the death-toll of a heatwave? Excess mortality figures are arrived at by comparing the death rate in a given period to the average for that period in previous years. We don't know that heat was a factor in all of those deaths - just that there were that many more deaths than the average for the same period over the previous five years. Death rates in summer tend to be relatively stable so this was an unusual spike. Researchers used this 2,091 figure as a baseline when calculating how many more people could die in heatwaves by 2050. They estimated there would be an increase of more than 200%, giving the 7,000 figure. The Office for National Statistics doesn't regularly look at how many deaths are linked to hot weather, but it does regularly publish excess winter mortality data. More people die in winter than in summer because of cold weather and higher rates of infectious illnesses such as flu. In the winter of 2016-17, there were 34,300 excess deaths compared with the death rate in the summer. The report says only 50% of UK motorways and major roads are surfaced with material that can withstand the kind of summer temperatures the country is beginning to experience regularly. During June's heatwave,railway tracks buckledcausing cancellations and delays. High heat reduces productivity. Workers arriving sweating to the office take time before they're ready to do the job. People working outside find themselves doing less and needing more breaks. The committee says Public Health England should tell employers to relax dress codes and allow flexible working in heatwaves. Labourers Peter Wackett, Jake Phillips and Luke Cahalane say they sweat lots in their overalls when it is hot Are your work clothes making you hotter? Heatwave exposes 17th Century garden Maximum workplace temperatures should also be introduced, especially for physical work. In schools, head teachers should be advised about safe classroom temperatures. And they should relax school uniform policy during hot weather. A recent study suggested wealthy private schools that could afford air conditioning would increase the relative exam success of their pupils during summer heat. Cities can be up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside because hard surfaces absorb heat during the day and give out heat at night. This is the heat island effect. If people get too hot in bed, it prevents them recovering from the previous day's heat. Yet the government's planning framework makes no mention of the heat island effect. And ministers withdrew funding for local authority climate change adaptation officers, who were working on the issue. The report calls for towns and cities to be adapted to more frequent heatwaves. Police horses take a drink from fountains in Green Park There have been consistent demands for water companies to store more water, especially in dry south-east England, and to plug leaks. New homes should have to use water more efficiently, MPs say. Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change, said: ""Water shortages are a concern. We can expect greater water deficits across the country, including in cooler wetter areas like north-west England. ""The area of land well suited to the production of water-intensive crops, such as rain-fed potatoes, could decline by over 80% by the 2050s."" Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Staying safe and cool in UK heatwaves The UK is still far off the 1976 heatwave, which saw temperatures of 32C and over for 15 consecutive days The committee says the government's heatwave alert system runs only from June to September, so vulnerable people will not be warned about unseasonal heatwaves. The MPs heard that alerts are put out only if approximately 30Â°C is reached, even though Public Health England said heat-related deaths began at upwards of 25Â°C. In the UK, many more preventable deaths happen because of cold weather than hot weather, but the government has failed to deliver its targets for insulating homes. If the UK's winters get warmer, as generally predicted, winter deaths will be reduced. But in a year like this one, the UK has suffered extremes of cold and heat. Both heat-related and cold-related health burdens in future will be amplified by population ageing. Charities point out that the UK's challenges from future heatwaves will be dwarfed by those in poor nations, which haven't caused the climate problem. A study,externalby Prof Richard Tol, at the University of Sussex, suggests poorer countries are likely to see their economic growth slowed because they depend on agriculture and outdoor work. His study says nations with hot climates will need economies three times larger than cooler countries if they are to withstand significant temperature rises. He says policymakers must consider poverty reduction as a crucial element of climate policy. An official told BBC News the government would ""carefully consider"" the report and would keep taking ""robust action to ensure our country is resilient and prepared"". The ""long-term plan for climate change adaptation"" will see work and investment to protect food and water supplies, businesses and communities, the official said.

"A photo from the plane showed both teams together in business class - before the women returned to economy The first mixed-sex tour in Barcelona football club's history has run afoul of women's team fans - after it emerged only the men flew in business class. The club posted glossy promotional video of the men's and women's teams boarding their US-bound plane together. But on board, after a photo op, the women were nowhere to be seen in the rest of the video. Photos posted to the female players' Instagram accounts, however, showed their team flying in economy. The division was spotted by eagle-eyed supporters of the women's team, who asked why the men - some of whom were from the ""B team"" as top-rated players were resting after the World Cup - got preferential treatment.

"There has been a huge rise in the number of unconditional offers being made to students for university places, admissions service Ucas says. The total made to 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland, and Wales has risen by 65,930 over the past five years - from 2,985 in 2013 to 67,915 in 2018. This means nearly a quarter (23%) of applicants received such an offer. The government said the figures pointed to a ""bums on seats"" mentality. And unions said the situation risked encouraging teenagers not to strive for the best A-level results possible. By the end of June this year, Ucas figures show there were 254,700 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland and Wales applying to university. Some of these students will have received offers from all five universities they applied to, while others may have had fewer. Of all the offers received, 7.1% were unconditional, meaning a degree course place is secured regardless of the grades they achieve. It is the first time that Ucas has analysed offer-making patterns during an application cycle, While the admissions service does not give any reason for the rise in unconditional offers, it says its analysis is part of its ongoing commitments to ""ensure transparency throughout the admissions process"". The data comes as the cap on the number of students a university can admit has been lifted and the population of 18-year-olds is falling. Students now pay as much as Â£9,250 a year in tuition fees. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""While there has been a steady growth in the number of unconditional offers made, they still account for a small proportion (7.1%) of all offers made by universities. ""Unconditional offers, when used appropriately, can help students and ensure that universities are able to respond flexibly to the range of applicants seeking places. ""Universities UK will continue to work with Ucas to monitor trends and any impact unconditional offer-making might have on student attainment. ""It is simply not in the interests of universities to take students without the potential to succeed."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah is not impressed by the figures. ""The rise in unconditional offers is completely irresponsible to students, and universities must start taking a lead, by limiting the number they offer,"" he said. ""Places at universities should only be offered to those who will benefit from them, and giving out unconditional offers just to put 'bums on seats' undermines the credibility of the university system. ""Along with the Office for Students, I am closely monitoring the number being issued and fully expect the regulator to take appropriate action. ""Unconditional offers risk distracting students from the final year of their schooling, and swaying their decisions does them a disservice - universities must act in the interest of students, not in filling spaces."" General secretary Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said: ""This huge increase in unconditional offers is driven by competition between universities and is not in the best interests of students. ""It can lead to students making less effort in their A-levels because their place is assured. ""That can then hamper their job prospects later down the line if potential employers take into account their A-level grades."" ASCL also expressed concerns that the move would disadvantage students who are the first in their family to go to university. ""First generation university applicants may well be more attracted to an unconditional offer than those who have the expertise and advice of their parents or school to ensure it's the appropriate course for them, with good career potential."" The University and College Union said unconditional offers made a mockery of exams and put students ""under enormous pressure to make snap decisions about their future"". UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""The proliferation of unconditional offers is detrimental to the interests of students and it is time the UK joined the rest of the world in basing university offers on actual achievements instead of on guesswork."" Olivia Harris, 18, has received an unconditional offer from her university and believes it may have pushed her to work harder. ""When I got an email from the university I really wanted to go to with the offer, I actually fell off the seat on the bus I was so happy. Olivia says she can plan ahead ""Not only so happy and proud that they thought I was a good enough candidate, but also a tiny bit of relief to know I had the offer. ""I think some people use it and think: 'Oh I don't have to work hard', but I think it may have pushed me more than not having it. ""I wanted to prove the point to people that I deserve it. ""In some ways it's a slight relief, when it comes to results day I won't be panicking thinking I've not got into university. ""It means I've already got my stuff prepared for where I want to go. I can plan ahead for when I start, otherwise I'd be waiting until the end of August to know if I get to go to university."" When universities make an offer to prospective students, the offer can either be conditional or unconditional. A conditional offer usually specifies the grades a student needs to achieve in their A-levels, BTecs, or any other relevant qualification, before they are fully accepted on to a course. Unconditional offers do not have any further academic requirements the student needs to meet - in other words, the place is guaranteed before exams are even taken. Ucas says they have, traditionally, been offered to: mature students who have already achieved their qualifications those applying for creative arts courses, after submitting a portfolio, or following a successful audition reduce the stress some students may feel during the  exam period attract and retain interest from students in a competitive marketplace Ucas director of external relations, Helen Thorne, said students should take the time to carefully think about all their options fully before accepting an unconditional offer. ""While unconditional offers are made for a number of reasons, we believe that universities should always emphasise to students the importance of completing their studies to the best of their abilities. ""Later this year, we'll be publishing more detailed analysis of offer-making, including any impact on students' attainment."" The figures do not include students from Scotland. Ucas said: ""In Scotland, a substantial proportion of students aged 18 who apply through Ucas undergraduate, have already attained SQA Highers and met the academic requirements to enter higher education. ""Therefore, students from Scotland are not included in this analysis.""

"This video can not be played  Former England footballer Gary Lineker has backed the campaign for another EU referendum, saying Brexit feels like it is ""going very wrong indeed"". The BBC Match of the Day presenter said some things in life were ""more important than football"". He is backing the People's Vote campaign, a cross-party group including prominent Labour and Lib Dem MPs. They are planning a ""summer of action"" to step up pressure on MPs to back a vote on the final Brexit deal. The government has ruled out another referendum after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year. Laura Kuenssberg: What now for Brexit and May? Pollwatch: The Chequers Brexit effect Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October. In a statement backing the People's Vote campaign, he said: ""I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed."" He said politicians seemed ""unable to resolve the problem"" the EU referendum had given them. Lineker has been critical of Brexit on social media in recent times, attracting claims of bias from Brexit supporters. Critics have also pointed to a Twitter message he sent a year ago, which said ""Can't find the bit in my tweet where I ask for another referendum. Leave won. Get over it."" Replying to those comments, Lineker tweeted he was ""happy to admit I've now changed my mind"", adding that he did not envisage ""at the time that we'd ever contemplate a 'no deal Brexit' and the ensuing carnage that would bring"". A spokesman for the BBC said: ""Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality."" Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who campaigned for Brexit in the referendum, was asked about Lineker's comments on ITV's Good Morning Britain. He said: ""I hesitate to criticise any individual - they're entitled to their opinion - but he's only one individual and during the referendum there were lots of stars and people who came out and endorsed this or the other, but people made up their own minds."" On the idea of MPs deciding to call a fresh referendum, he said that although most MPs had been for Remain in the 2016 vote, ""they have to accept the result... this will be a crisis for our democracy if the British people are ignored"".

"This video can not be played Mercury Prize 2018: Watch the nominees in action Arctic Monkeys, arguably Britain's biggest rock band, are among the 12 nominees for the 2018 Mercury Prize. Their space lounge concept album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino, earns the band a fourth nomination for the award, established in 1992 as a high-minded alternative to the Brits. But the quartet face stiff competition from the likes of Jorja Smith, Lily Allen and Florence + The Machine. Other nominees include Wolf Alice, Noel Gallagher and jazz act Sons of Kemet. Last year's winner, Sampha, also features on the soulful Everything Is Recorded, a collaborative album put together by the head of XL Records, Richard Russell - aka ""the man who signed Adele"". The Arctics, Gallagher and Florence are 4-1 favourites at bookmakers William Hill, with Wolf Alice, Smith and Allen given odds of 6-1. Arctic Monkeys are nominated for their sixth album, while Jorja Smith is up for her debut Several of the shortlisted albums are overtly political. Both Nadine Shah's Holiday Destination and Everything Everything's A Fever Dream address the rise in nationalism and xenophobia, coupled with a decline in empathy. London MC Novelist, meanwhile, delivers a strong anti-violence message on his self-produced debut album, Novelist Guy; and Sons Of Kemet's Your Queen Is A Reptile celebrates powerful black women who've been overlooked by history. Read more about the nominees on BBC Music Sampha wins the 2017 Mercury Prize Why the album 'needs protecting' ""It was really important to document the times we're living in,"" Shah told the BBC. ""As a Muslim woman [living during] a rise in Islamophobia, I'm scared. I'm genuinely scared. So I needed to speak about that."" Other nominees turn their attention inwards, with Florence + The Machine displaying a new level of vulnerability on High As Hope; and Jorja Smith chronicling the bumpy road to adulthood on her streetwise debut Lost & Found. Pop star Lily Allen receives her first ever nomination for her fourth album, No Shame, an emotional depiction of her marital breakdown and struggles with self-worth. ""Making this record was really tough and it was a slog,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt very disconnected from myself as I was making it. I was trying to find me in and amongst it all. The fact it's connected to other people, it just feels really great."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Novelist - Novelist Guy Sons of Kemet - Your Queen Is A Reptile Wolf Alice - Visions of a Life The 2018 shortlist was drawn up by a panel of judges including musicians Marcus Mumford, Jamie Cullum and Ella Eyre, alongside broadcasters Clara Amfo and Mistajam, and a handful of music critics and journalists. They said the nominees held a ""shared belief in the importance of music for navigating life's challenges - whether personal or political, falling in or out of love, growing up or looking back, angry or ecstatic."" All the nominees (including Novelist, Nadine Shah and Wolf Alice) get a trophy, with the ultimate winner decided in September Although the award has a reputation for rewarding up-and-coming acts, there are only three debut albums on this year's list, alongside two number one records and five former nominees. Radio 1's Huw Stephens welcomed the inclusion of artists on their third, fourth or (in Noel Gallagher's case) 10th albums. ""Hopefully it says that we're not as flash-in-the-pan as we have been in the past and that artists have time to build and to grow."" ""Artists like Arctic Monkeys and Florence + The Machine are being allowed time to develop. They don't always have to go to number one and sell out stadiums and headline Glastonbury. They can just work at their craft for years."" Arctic Monkeys, who won the prize for their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, are now the second most-nominated act in the Mercury's 26-year history. Only Radiohead have more nominations, with five, although they've never taken home the trophy. PJ Harvey also has four nominations - and is the only artist to win the award twice, for Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea in 2001 and Let England Shake in 2011. This year's winner will be unveiled at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 20 September. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""This was a very big day for free and fair trade"" The US and EU have agreed to avoid an all-out trade war and work to lower tariffs, in talks that US President Donald Trump hailed as ""a very strong understanding"". He and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker announced a ""new phase"" in EU-US relations, after Wednesday's meeting at the White House. Mr Trump's threat to impose tariffs on European cars was put aside. The EU plans to buy more US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and soybeans. A joint statement said the two leaders agreed,externalto ""work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods"". US import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, imposed in March, will however remain in place. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A working group of senior advisers will meet to facilitate trade and lower barriers. The two sides pledged to refrain from new trade restrictions during those negotiations. A full-blown trade war had been looming, fuelled by the tariffs introduced by Mr Trump. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Trade tariffs: Real war or phoney war US carmakers hit by trade disputes EU-US relations had been further frayed by Mr Trump's tributes to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his attacks on Nato and the EU. Mr Trump's language after meeting Mr Juncker was enthusiastic, in contrast with the angry tone he adopted previously towards the EU, calling it a ""foe"" on trade. Mr Trump has come under pressure domestically because of retaliatory tariffs imposed on US goods by China, the EU, Canada and Mexico. US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc appeared to be the latest casualty of the trade row with China.It dropped a $44bn (Â£33.5bn) bidto take over NXP Semiconductors, after China failed to give approval for it. On Tuesday theTrump administration announced up to $12bn in aid for US farmershurt by the Chinese tariffs. Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump declared a ""new phase in the relationship"" between the US and the EU, calling it a ""very big day for free and fair trade"". Mr Juncker thanked the president and hailed a ""constructive meeting"". Mr Trump said the EU would become a ""massive buyer"" of US liquefied natural gas and the joint statement said EU imports of LNG would increase, to diversify Europe's energy supply. Mr Trump has condemned Germany's project to expand imports of Russian natural gas, via a new Baltic pipeline. ""The EU is going (...) to buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers, primarily in the Midwest,"" Mr Trump said. Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels EU officials have been giving more details of the deal brokered in Washington. The working group will investigate long-term ways to reduce tariffs on industrial goods - not cars or agricultural products - and how to bring down the extra tariffs on steel and aluminium recently applied by US authorities. It will report at the end of November - after the midterm elections in the US. The pledge to buy more American soybeans is actually a promise not to interfere in market forces that mean the EU is buying more anyway. ""We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,"" said an official. And this is not a revival of the controversial TTIP trade pact between the EU and US or a big free trade agreement. That would take much longer and would require the consent of the EU member states.

Mr Trump accuses the WTO of treating the US unfairly - though mostly the US has won in arbitration cases there. Mr Juncker said striking a deal on zero tariffs on industrial goods was his ""main intention"". ""I had one intention today, to make a deal, and we made a deal. We have a number of areas on which to work together,"" he said. No announcement was made on car tariffs, and it was not clear whether any progress had been made on resolving the issue. Mr Trump had threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on European cars. On Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the two were ""turning a page"" on trade, while German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed it as a ""breakthrough"". Allow Twitter content?

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the agreement, but called for ""clarifications"". He said there was no point trying to clinch any major trade deal with the US. Agriculture must be excluded, he said, because Europe could not compromise on food safety and environmental standards.

"There has been a huge rise in the number of unconditional offers being made to students for university places, admissions service Ucas says. The total made to 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland, and Wales has risen by 65,930 over the past five years - from 2,985 in 2013 to 67,915 in 2018. This means nearly a quarter (23%) of applicants received such an offer. The government said the figures pointed to a ""bums on seats"" mentality. And unions said the situation risked encouraging teenagers not to strive for the best A-level results possible. By the end of June this year, Ucas figures show there were 254,700 18-year-olds from England, Northern Ireland and Wales applying to university. Some of these students will have received offers from all five universities they applied to, while others may have had fewer. Of all the offers received, 7.1% were unconditional, meaning a degree course place is secured regardless of the grades they achieve. It is the first time that Ucas has analysed offer-making patterns during an application cycle, While the admissions service does not give any reason for the rise in unconditional offers, it says its analysis is part of its ongoing commitments to ""ensure transparency throughout the admissions process"". The data comes as the cap on the number of students a university can admit has been lifted and the population of 18-year-olds is falling. Students now pay as much as Â£9,250 a year in tuition fees. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""While there has been a steady growth in the number of unconditional offers made, they still account for a small proportion (7.1%) of all offers made by universities. ""Unconditional offers, when used appropriately, can help students and ensure that universities are able to respond flexibly to the range of applicants seeking places. ""Universities UK will continue to work with Ucas to monitor trends and any impact unconditional offer-making might have on student attainment. ""It is simply not in the interests of universities to take students without the potential to succeed."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah is not impressed by the figures. ""The rise in unconditional offers is completely irresponsible to students, and universities must start taking a lead, by limiting the number they offer,"" he said. ""Places at universities should only be offered to those who will benefit from them, and giving out unconditional offers just to put 'bums on seats' undermines the credibility of the university system. ""Along with the Office for Students, I am closely monitoring the number being issued and fully expect the regulator to take appropriate action. ""Unconditional offers risk distracting students from the final year of their schooling, and swaying their decisions does them a disservice - universities must act in the interest of students, not in filling spaces."" General secretary Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said: ""This huge increase in unconditional offers is driven by competition between universities and is not in the best interests of students. ""It can lead to students making less effort in their A-levels because their place is assured. ""That can then hamper their job prospects later down the line if potential employers take into account their A-level grades."" ASCL also expressed concerns that the move would disadvantage students who are the first in their family to go to university. ""First generation university applicants may well be more attracted to an unconditional offer than those who have the expertise and advice of their parents or school to ensure it's the appropriate course for them, with good career potential."" The University and College Union said unconditional offers made a mockery of exams and put students ""under enormous pressure to make snap decisions about their future"". UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""The proliferation of unconditional offers is detrimental to the interests of students and it is time the UK joined the rest of the world in basing university offers on actual achievements instead of on guesswork."" Olivia Harris, 18, has received an unconditional offer from her university and believes it may have pushed her to work harder. ""When I got an email from the university I really wanted to go to with the offer, I actually fell off the seat on the bus I was so happy. Olivia says she can plan ahead ""Not only so happy and proud that they thought I was a good enough candidate, but also a tiny bit of relief to know I had the offer. ""I think some people use it and think: 'Oh I don't have to work hard', but I think it may have pushed me more than not having it. ""I wanted to prove the point to people that I deserve it. ""In some ways it's a slight relief, when it comes to results day I won't be panicking thinking I've not got into university. ""It means I've already got my stuff prepared for where I want to go. I can plan ahead for when I start, otherwise I'd be waiting until the end of August to know if I get to go to university."" When universities make an offer to prospective students, the offer can either be conditional or unconditional. A conditional offer usually specifies the grades a student needs to achieve in their A-levels, BTecs, or any other relevant qualification, before they are fully accepted on to a course. Unconditional offers do not have any further academic requirements the student needs to meet - in other words, the place is guaranteed before exams are even taken. Ucas says they have, traditionally, been offered to: mature students who have already achieved their qualifications those applying for creative arts courses, after submitting a portfolio, or following a successful audition reduce the stress some students may feel during the  exam period attract and retain interest from students in a competitive marketplace Ucas director of external relations, Helen Thorne, said students should take the time to carefully think about all their options fully before accepting an unconditional offer. ""While unconditional offers are made for a number of reasons, we believe that universities should always emphasise to students the importance of completing their studies to the best of their abilities. ""Later this year, we'll be publishing more detailed analysis of offer-making, including any impact on students' attainment."" The figures do not include students from Scotland. Ucas said: ""In Scotland, a substantial proportion of students aged 18 who apply through Ucas undergraduate, have already attained SQA Highers and met the academic requirements to enter higher education. ""Therefore, students from Scotland are not included in this analysis.""

"This video can not be played Five things to know about Imran Khan (from 2018) Early results from Pakistan's election suggest ex-cricket star Imran Khan is on course to become prime minister. With nearly half the votes counted from Wednesday's parliamentary election, Mr Khan's PTI party is in the lead. It is expected to fall short of an overall majority and to seek coalition partners. Officials deny claims of vote rigging made by Mr Khan's rivals. Campaigning has been marred by violence. On voting day a bomb killed 31 people at a polling station. Mr Khan, the charismatic captain who led Pakistan to a World Cup victory in 1992, has long shed his celebrity playboy image and has recently faced accusations that his election challenge is benefiting from military interference in the nuclear-armed republic. The cricket hero who could be Pakistan's next PM Why Pakistan's election matters With votes counted in 49% of stations, Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was leading in 119 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies being contested, Pakistan's Dawn Newspaper reported, citing election commission figures. A total of 137 seats is required for a majority. Newspapers featuring Mr Khan read ""victory"" and ""man of the match"" This election will mark only the second time that a civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term in Pakistan. But the party of disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has rejected the results, as have a host of smaller parties, all alleging vote-rigging and manipulation. ""The way the people's mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable,"" Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and brother of the former prime minister. Mr Khan, who first entered politics in 1996 but struggled for years on the political sidelines, now styles himself as a pious, populist, anti-poverty reformer. The 65-year-old campaigned on a message of anti-corruption and vowed to take on Pakistan's entrenched political dynasties. But his views on Islamist militancy will be scrutinised if he becomes prime minister - he has criticised some of the Taliban's violence but last year his party's government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province gave $3m (Â£2.3m) to the notorious Haqqania madrassa, headed by a man known as the ""father of the Taliban"". On Thursday, Dawn said the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had raised questions over the voting process. ""The commission received complaints that in many areas women were not allowed to vote,"" the newspaper reported. The party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,the historically liberal PPP, is widely expected to come third. It is now fronted by Ms Bhutto's son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, a 29-year-old who became party chairman when he was still a student at Oxford University. The turnout has been estimated at between 50% and 55% out of 106 million registered voters, AFP reports. Before the election Mr Khan told the BBC that if he were to be elected, his initial focus would be on the economy. Pakistan's currency, the rupee, has declined by 20%. Inflation is on the rise and the trade deficit widening. Exports such as textiles have taken a hit from cheaper products by regional competitors, including China. Analysts say the new government may need to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the country's second bailout since 2013. The BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad says tough decisions that could entail curbs on spending will be easier in a government Mr Khan is able to dominate. However, if his rivals continue to reject the results, and even potentially launch the kind of street protests Mr Khan did while in opposition, the country could face political instability. Pakistan has a population of nearly 200 million, and is a nuclear-armed rival to India, a key developing economy and one of the world's largest Muslim-majority nations. The country has been ruled on and off by the military during its 71-year history, so this election is significant because it is considered the country's second consecutive democratic transition. BBC news programme sorry for Imran Khan mix-up Viewpoint: Pakistan's dirtiest election in years Fears of 'creeping coup' in Pakistan The election has been seen as a contest between Mr Khan's PTI party and Mr Sharif's PML-N. Mr Sharif, who won the last election, has been jailed for corruption after ascandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak. Both the run-up to the vote, and the vote count itself, have been highly controversial. Ahead of the elections, the PML-N complained of a targeted crackdown by the security establishment, with the alleged help of the courts, in favour of the PTI party. The Pakistani military denied interfering in politics.

Who are the 'angels' and the 'electables'? Nawaz Sharif: Pakistan's three-time PM Bilawal Bhutto Zardari: Heir to a political dynasty After the polls closed on Wednesday, several political groups alleged that vote rigging was taking place in polling stations - something denied by election officials. Representatives from several parties said that their polling agents were expelled from polling stations during vote count and were denied certified copies of results - breaching election procedures. Analysts have also highlighted unusual delays in the announcement of unofficial results in dozens of constituencies, especially in the crucial province of Punjab which has been a stronghold of PML-N.

"The High Court ruling on Sir Cliff Richard's privacy case against the BBC has prompted reaction from media, police and friends of the singer. Here's what's being discussed. While the BBC has apologised to Sir Cliff Richard for the distress caused by coverage of the raid on his home, the ruling could have an impact on press freedom, its director of news said. Fran Unsworth admitted the case had had a ""very serious impact"" on Sir Cliff, adding there were things that could have been done differently. But, she noted, the judge stressed that even if no footage of the search had been broadcast, then ""the very naming of Sir Cliff would have been unlawful"". This video can not be played The BBC's director of news said she would be going through the whole judgement in detail ""This creates a significant shift against press freedom,"" said Ms Unsworth. ""This means police investigations and searches of people's homes could go unreported and unscrutinised. It will put decision-making about naming individuals in the hands of the police over the public's right to know. ""We don't believe this is compatible with liberty and press freedoms."" Ms Unsworth said there was ""an important principle at stake"", which is why the BBC is considering an appeal. Asked by a reporter outside court if she or Jonathan Munro, the BBC's head of newsgathering, intended to resign, she said it was a ""very long"" judgement and that the BBC had to ""take time to consider what lessons are to be learned"". There has been concern in the media over the ruling and the implications it could have for press freedom. The Society of Editors said,externalthat the judgement ""threatens the ability of the media as a whole to police the police"". Ian Murray, its executive director, said: ""The ruling to make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named is a major step and one that has worrying consequences for press freedom and the public's right to know."" He said making it unlawful to name someone under investigation is ""extreme"". ""Certainly, such a major change in the law should be debated in Parliament and not come into force following one case involving a high-profile celebrity,"" said Mr Murray. ""In many situations, the publishing of the name of someone under investigation has led to other witnesses and victims coming forward. We should also consider that the reverse is true. It is vital that the actions of the police should be kept under scrutiny in a free society and this change in the law will make that much harder."" Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman said the ruling was ""an atrocity for a free media"" and would ""dramatically restrict the freedom to report"". Allow Twitter content?

Sir Cliff said he was ""choked up"" and that the judgement was ""wonderful news"". His lawyer Gideon Benaim said the impact on Sir Cliff had been ""profound"". ""He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle,"" he said. ""Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case - and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law - Sir Cliff's motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what. ""His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through."" This video can not be played ""It's going to take a little while to get over the whole emotional factor"" On the matter of press freedom, Jon Oakley of Simkins law firm - which represented Sir Cliff - said: ""Where there is a genuine public interest in people being named - for example, where there is imminent risk or danger to the public - the press rightly continues to be free to identify the person being investigated. ""However, after very careful consideration, the judge found that any such public interest does not exist on the facts of this particular case. ""Therefore, rather than heralding any change in the law, we believe what this case represents is confirmation of what has already been the legal position for some time."" Paul Gambaccini spoke to reporters outside court after the ruling Paul Gambaccini, broadcaster and friend of Sir Cliff, said that when the singer found out about the raid he collapsed to the floor weeping, but that another friend had told him to fight the case. ""And he has fought it,"" said Mr Gambaccini. ""And he's fought it for three years, 11 months and four days. And now he's been vindicated."" Gloria Hunniford, speaking on ITV's Loose Women, revealed Sir Cliff had spent Â£4m of his own money on legal fees. ""I hope his life begins as of now,"" she said. ""Let's get on with what he does best."" Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative MP Anna Soubry called for a change in the law over naming suspects. Prime Minister Theresa May said in response that it was a ""difficult issue"" that needed ""careful judgement"". Chief Constable Stephen Watson of South Yorkshire Police accepted the judge's findings. He said: ""I particularly welcome Mr Justice Mann's findings that all South Yorkshire Police officers and staff were found to have acted entirely honestly and were credible and reliable witnesses. ""At a very early stage of these proceedings, we accepted and apologised to Sir Cliff Richard for the mistakes we made in our attempts to protect the integrity of the police investigation and the rights of the complainant, balanced against Sir Cliff Richard's privacy rights. ""I would like to take this opportunity to again offer our sincere apologies for the distress Sir Cliff Richard has suffered."" Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ""I welcome the judgement in this case and am sorry for the distress caused to Sir Cliff Richard over this difficult period of time. ""South Yorkshire Police admitted and acknowledged their mistakes, settling damages with Sir Cliff Richard out of court in 2017. ""I have also been assured by South Yorkshire Police, that they have implemented the five recommendations in the 2014 Trotter Review, an independent review into the disclosure of information to the BBC.""

"Hoping to be a ninja? Sorry, but the Japanese city of Iga is not hiring A Japanese city has been forced to clarify it is not in fact recruiting ninjas, following reports that it was facing a shortage of skilled assassins. Local officials in Iga, which styles itself as the birthplace of ninja-dom, had received a flood of applications from around the world. Butthey said in a statement (in Japanese) that they were not officially hiring any,external, ""so please be careful"". The mix-up apparently began with a report by a US broadcaster. On 16 July, National Public Radio (NPR) reported in its The Indicator from Planet Money podcast that Iga was struggling to expand its ninja-based tourism strategy because of a labour shortage. ""Iga will build a second ninja museum [but faces a] labour shortage.... [which] also extends to ninjas,"" said journalist Sally Herships in the NPR podcast. ""There's a ninja shortage, or to be accurate, a ninja-performer shortage."" Japanese police arrest 74-year-old ninja thief suspect Meet the last of the Japanese ninjas Japan's ninjas heading for extinction Ms Herships also added that ninja performers in Japan could make anywhere between $23,000 and $85,000 a year, though she did not say that there were immediate vacancies for ninjas available. The NPR podcast fuelled a frenzy of online reports, with many suggesting that the city was looking to hire ninjas at a salary of $85,000 a year. NPR later said that a summary of its podcast had been ""incorrectly stated"", and that its story may have been misunderstood. The podcast by NPR said that Iga faced a 'ninja shortage' NPR had posted a summary which said that Iga ""is facing a serious problem, there aren't enough people training to be ninjas, not even for $85k a year"". ""That characterisation was incorrect,"" an NPR spokesman told the BBC. ""After the story was posted online, portions of the story may have been misconstrued on social media or abridged in other media outlets."" But  those reports led at least 115 ninja hopefuls from 23 countries to contact Iga officials, enquiring about possible jobs. ""Most were questions about whether we were really hiring, but there were a few that begged us to employ them and tried to promote themselves,"" tourism strategy official Motoyoshi Shimai told Reuters news agency. ""Some had real confidence in their bodies and strength."" Iga has wasted no time in capitalising on the confusion, turning it to its advantage. In its statement, it extolled the virtues of its ""splendid tourist attractions including facilities about ninjas"". Besides its first ninja museum, the central Japanese city also has several ninja costume rental shops and holds a yearly ninja festival where visitors can ""throw ninja stars and use blowguns"", according to Iga's tourism website. ""Iga is not officially hiring but this is where ninjas originated,"" the city said in its statement. ""You can feel and experience their history throughout the city, so please visit us.""

"This video can not be played  Former England footballer Gary Lineker has backed the campaign for another EU referendum, saying Brexit feels like it is ""going very wrong indeed"". The BBC Match of the Day presenter said some things in life were ""more important than football"". He is backing the People's Vote campaign, a cross-party group including prominent Labour and Lib Dem MPs. They are planning a ""summer of action"" to step up pressure on MPs to back a vote on the final Brexit deal. The government has ruled out another referendum after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year. Laura Kuenssberg: What now for Brexit and May? Pollwatch: The Chequers Brexit effect Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October. In a statement backing the People's Vote campaign, he said: ""I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed."" He said politicians seemed ""unable to resolve the problem"" the EU referendum had given them. Lineker has been critical of Brexit on social media in recent times, attracting claims of bias from Brexit supporters. Critics have also pointed to a Twitter message he sent a year ago, which said ""Can't find the bit in my tweet where I ask for another referendum. Leave won. Get over it."" Replying to those comments, Lineker tweeted he was ""happy to admit I've now changed my mind"", adding that he did not envisage ""at the time that we'd ever contemplate a 'no deal Brexit' and the ensuing carnage that would bring"". A spokesman for the BBC said: ""Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality."" Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who campaigned for Brexit in the referendum, was asked about Lineker's comments on ITV's Good Morning Britain. He said: ""I hesitate to criticise any individual - they're entitled to their opinion - but he's only one individual and during the referendum there were lots of stars and people who came out and endorsed this or the other, but people made up their own minds."" On the idea of MPs deciding to call a fresh referendum, he said that although most MPs had been for Remain in the 2016 vote, ""they have to accept the result... this will be a crisis for our democracy if the British people are ignored"".

"Three major automakers have warned that changes to trade policies are hurting performance. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler also slashed its 2018 revenue outlook, after sales in China slumped as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. Shares in all three companies fell after they reported results. General Motors shares ended the day about 5% lower, while Fiat Chrysler shares sank about 11%. Shares in Ford, which reported its earnings to investors results later in the day, dropped about 4% in after hours trade. Harley-Davidson warns Trump-EU trade war will harm business US faces retaliation if car tariffs go ahead Ford said tariffs, including on steel and aluminium, could cost it up to $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn), while General Motors said higher metals prices would add about $600m-$700m to costs. General Motors chief executive Mary Barra said the firm had anticipated higher costs this year, but ""the challenge has become significantly greater than we expected"". At Fiat Chrysler, executives said fixed price contracts have helped to shield it from some of the impact of higher metals prices, but they warned those expenses would rise in 2019. Ms Barra said the firm had been in frequent contact with the White House about how trade policies would affect its business. In addition to the metals tariffs, the Trump administration is considering placing new duties on foreign vehicles and car parts. Carmakers are also grappling with questions about the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). General Motors said it is also worried that trade tensions could eventually put buyers in China off American brands. China is GM's biggest market after North America. ""We are in a very uncertain and volatile environment at this time,"" said GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens. The warnings came amid disappointing quarterly results. Ford revenues slipped by 2.3% to $38.9bn, while profits nearly halved as sales in China fell and it halted some production due to a fire at a key parts supplier. At GM, sales and revenue fell almost 1% to $36.8bn, despite gains in the US, where the number of vehicles sold to dealerships increased by 4.6% amid increased demand for pickup trucks. The firm reported profit of about $2.4bn, down roughly 2.8% year-on-year. Fiat Chrysler revenue increased 4% in the quarter to almost 29bn euros, but profits tumbled by 35%. The firm said it expected sales in China to rebound, but faced future challenges as new emissions rules in the country come into effect.

"The BBC has agreed to pay Sir Cliff Richard Â£850,000 towards his legal costs within 14 days, following his privacy case against the corporation. A judge ruled the BBC infringed the singer's privacy in its reporting of a police raid on his home in 2014,awarding him Â£210,000in damages. Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged as part of the investigation. The BBC sought leave to appealagainst the High Court ruling but the application was rejected. The corporation has apologised to Sir Cliff for the distress caused, but wanted permission to appeal, arguing the court judgement could threaten press freedom. The BBC will now decide whether or not to go directly to the Court of Appeal to seek permission to appeal. A BBC spokesperson said: ""This is a complex case and while we hadn't decided on whether to pursue an appeal, we sought permission today in order to keep all options open. ""We reiterate that we are very sorry to Sir Cliff for the distress caused and have no desire to prolong this case unnecessarily, but the ruling has raised significant questions for press freedom and we are considering the best way to address these."" The judge's findings had included that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while he was a suspect in the South Yorkshire Police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. Reaction to the Sir Cliff case BBC bosses 'should carry the can' Barrister Gavin Millar QC, leading the BBC legal team, told a hearing on Thursday it was ""appropriate"" for the corporation to pay legal fees incurred by Sir Cliff. The Â£850,000 may not be the final total for his legal fees, but Sir Cliff is being given it now to pay his lawyers. The singer's lawyer, barrister Justin Rushbrooke QC, did not give an overall figure for how much the case had cost his client, but Sir Cliff told the trial he had spent more than Â£3m. The BBC is also going to pay Â£315,000 to South Yorkshire Police for legal costs. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard v BBC - how did we get here? By Amol Rajan, BBC News media editor For the BBC, the decision whether to spend more money on this case is a difficult dilemma with high stakes. There are many factors to consider. First, will an appeal cause further distress to Sir Cliff? The corporation has said that it is sorry for the distress caused to him, so why extend the agony? Second, to fight this verdict is to keep it in the public eye. An appeal could create the possibility of more adverse publicity. Third, what are the chances of success? And finally, this is public money. Sir Cliff is commonly regarded as a national treasure. Why throw more of other people's money - ie licence-fee payers' incomes - at a case in which a national treasure is aggrieved? But what is the cost of not appealing? If the freedom of journalists is diminished as a result of editorial decisions made by the BBC, then not fighting this verdict could lead to resentment in Fleet Street, where the BBC lacks friends. And then there is the principle. Many journalists, inside the corporation and beyond, really do feel that journalism would be damaged. Read more from Amol Mr Justice Mann ruled in favour of Sir Cliff, 77, following the trial in London. He concluded the BBC's coverage - which involved a helicopter filming the search at Sir Cliff's Berkshire home - had been a ""very serious"" invasion of privacy. Police officers had been investigating an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in 1985, when he was a child. Last week, Mr Justice Mann awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages after the BBCsubmitted its coverage of the raid for an award. The BBC must pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police 35%. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force. On Thursday, the BBC's Mr Millar outlined his permission to appeal arguments in a written document, saying there was a ""compelling reason"" for the case to be heard and that it had a ""real prospect"" of success. It was rejected by Mr Justice Mann on all counts, however. The BBC's director of news has said the ruling could have an impact on press freedom. Speaking outside court last week, Fran Unsworth admitted the case had had a ""very serious impact"" on Sir Cliff, and there were things that could have been done differently. But she stressed that even if no footage of the search had been broadcast, ""the very naming of Sir Cliff would have been unlawful"", according to the judge's ruling. ""This creates a significant shift against press freedom,"" Ms Unsworth said. High stakes for BBC What's the reaction to the Sir Cliff case?

"This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard v BBC - how did we get here? The BBC is to seek permission to appeal a ruling over its coverage of a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home. A high court judge ruled last week that the BBC infringed Sir Cliff's privacy in its reporting of the story in 2014, and awarded him Â£210,000 damages. The raid was part of an investigation into historical child sex allegations - Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged. The BBC argues the ruling could put press freedom at stake. The broadcaster will later seek leave to appeal all of the main findings of law in Mr Justice Mann's judgment - although the judge is unlikely to grant an appeal against his own ruling. BBC legal affairs correspondent, Clive Coleman, said that if he refuses, it will be up to the broadcaster to decide whether to go directly to the Court of Appeal - which he understands the corporation is ""carefully considering"". Sir Cliff Richard wins case against BBC BBC bosses should carry the can - Sir Cliff What's the reaction to the Sir Cliff case? The BBC wants to challenge the judge's findings, including that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while a suspect in a police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. It will also seek to appeal Sir Cliff's entitlement to damages for injury to his reputation in a privacy case, as opposed to a defamation claim. The corporation will argue the Â£210,000 damages awarded will have a damaging effect on media outlets who are aware of a suspect's identity but who do not want to publish for fear of having to make a large payout. The judge has yet to decide how much Sir Cliff was left out of pocket. The singer has said plans for his professional work were ""seriously disrupted"" and that he was left ""in effect in creative limbo"" for two years. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard's lawyer said the singer ""aimed to right a wrong"" At the ruling earlier this month, Mr Justice Mann said a suspect in a police investigation ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"", and while Sir Cliff being investigated ""might be of interest to the gossip-monger"", there was not a ""genuine public interest"" case. He also said that while the case could have a ""significant impact on press reporting"", it did not mean the law was changing or he was setting a precedent as the Human Rights Act already covers the issues at stake. After the ruling last week, the BBC's director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth apologised to Sir Cliff and said: ""In retrospect, there are things we would have done differently."" But, she said, the case marked a ""significant shift"" against press freedom and an ""important principle"" around the public's right to know was at stake. This video can not be played The BBC's director of news said immediately after the ruling that the BBC was considering an appeal Speaking to ITV afterwards, Sir Cliff said senior managers at the BBC have to ""carry the can"" for their actions, adding: ""It's too big a decision to be made badly. It was nonsense."" ""I want a correction made to what happened to me and it was made,"" he said. ""Nobody said anything about freedom of speech. ""But I will fight to the death against the abuse of the freedom of speech [and] what the BBC did was an abuse. ""They took it upon themselves to be judge, jury and executioner.""

"Police have gathered outside the embassy building in central Beijing A man has set off a small explosive device close to the US embassy in Beijing, officials have confirmed. Apart from the attacker, there were no injuries reported and officials say police responded immediately. Video and images posted on social media show smoke rising from the vicinity of the embassy in the heart of the Chinese capital with crowds gathering. State media outletGlobal Times tweeted that local residents had heard a ""thunder-like bang"",external. A statement from the US embassy in Beijing said a device, which they described as a bomb, had exploded at around 1300 local time (0500 GMT) at the south-east corner of the compound. Beijing police called it a ""suspected firecracker device"" which caused a fire. The bomber injured his hand during the incident, but there was no danger to his life and he was immediately sent to hospital. Police gave his surname as Jiang, and said he was from the Inner Mongolia province. The BBC's Stephen McDonell at the scene says that normal activities have since resumed at the embassy, with people still lining up for visa applications. There were earlier reports that  police had taken away a woman who had tried to set herself on fire near the embassy at 1100 local time, several hours before the reported blast. It is unclear if the two incidents were linked. Attacks on sites in the Chinese capital are rare. The most serious incident in recent years sawa car ploughing into a crowd at Tiananmen Square in 2013, killing five people including the attackers. China blamed the incident on Muslim Uighur separatists.

"Self-balancing electric roller skates developed by personal transportation company Segway-Ninebot are to be banned on the UK's public pavements and roads. The Department for Transport (DfT) told the BBC the skates fell under the same rules as powered rideables such as electric scooters and ""hoverboards"". Segway-Ninebot said its new skates had a top speed of 12 km/h (7.5mph). However, they are classed as ""carriages"" under the Highways Act of 1835 and are banned from the pavement. The skates have a ""travel time"" of 45 minutes Video-maker Casey Neistat, who was given a pair of the skates totest in New York City,external, also faced difficulty finding places to try them out. He said he preferred riding them on smooth surfaces, but was quickly stopped riding inside Grand Central Station by a security officer. The DfT added that powered transporters were usually not allowed on UK roads. It said: ""For most powered transporters, their construction is such that they clearly would not comply with the normal vehicle construction rules or with type approval."" This would limit their use to private property with the landowner's permission. The same rules apply to electric scooters, electric unicycles and the two-wheeled ""hoverboards"".

"Cult leader Asahara was executed earlier this month Japan has executed the remaining members of a cult behind the deadly 1995 Sarin attack on the Tokyo subway. The six men were the last members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult on death row, and were executed on Thursday, the justice ministry said. Seven others responsible for the attack, including leader Shoko Asahara, were put to death earlier this month. The Sarin attack, Japan's worst terror incident, killed 13 people and injured thousands more. The cult was accused of several other murders and an earlier Sarin gas attack in 1994 which killed eight and left 600 injured. ""The pain and anguish of the people who were killed and their families as well as of the survivors left with disabilities, was unimaginable,"" said justice minister Yoko Kamikawa at a news conference. Those put to death on Thursday included a key Aum Shinrikyo recruiter and cult members who released the nerve gas in train carriages, reported Japanese broadcaster NHK. The execution of all 12 cult members involved in the attack  as well as Asahara had been postponed until their final appeals were completed, which happened in January. Who are Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo? Aum Shinrikyo: Images from the 1995 Tokyo Sarin attack On 20 March 1995, cult members released Sarin on the subway in the Japanese capital. Witnesses described noticing packages leaking some liquid and feeling stinging fumes hitting their eyes soon afterwards. Victims were treated by emergency medical teams The toxin struck victims down in a matter of seconds, leaving them choking and vomiting, some blinded and paralysed. Thirteen people died. Aum Shinrikyo, often shortened to Aum, believed that the end of the world was coming and that those outside the cult would go to hell - unless they were killed by cult members. In the months after, members of the cult made several failed attempts to release hydrogen cyanide in various stations. The cult, whose name means ""supreme truth"", began in the 1980s as a spiritual group mixing Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, later working in elements of apocalyptic Christian prophesies. Cult leader Shoko Asahara declared himself to be both Christ and the first ""enlightened one"" since Buddha. The cult attacked with deadly nerve gas Aum Shinrikyo gained official status as a religious organisation in Japan in 1989 and picked up a sizeable global following. The group gradually became a paranoid doomsday cult, convinced the world was about to end in a global war and that only they would survive. The cult went underground after the 1995 attack, but did not disappear, renaming itself Aleph or Hikari no Wa. Aum Shinrikyo is designated a terrorist organisation in the US and many other countries, but Aleph and Hikari no Wa are both legal in Japan, although designated as ""dangerous religions"" subject to surveillance.

Station manager Clainton Murray said the fire was thought to have started in a flat on the fourth floor. ""The flat was severely damaged by fire and a large part of the roof was also destroyed,"" he said. Due to fears that the roof could collapse, firefighters evacuated residents from the top floor and helped two people escape from the first floor. A number of other residents self-evacuated from lower floors, Mr Murray said. Firefighters believe the blaze started on the fourth floor of Welbeck Mansions About 50 people were evacuated from the flats, the fire service said ""Firefighters have carried out salvage operations to save, where possible, residents' possessions from water damage,"" he added. ""In the early stages, the fire was very visible and could be seen for miles around."" A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said no injuries have been reported. A cordon was in place as about 100 firefighters tackled the blaze Angelica Malin lives near the flats and could see the blaze from her bedroom window. ""I can see firefighters inside as the roof is on fire and there's two men on cranes working on putting the roof fire out,"" she said. ""It's so scary - my flat is filled with the smell of smoke. The firemen have been amazing and I feel comforted by the incredible response."" It's quiet now here on the street - there's the police, the fire brigade, and a tiny bit of smoke - you can smell it in the air.

"Self-balancing electric roller skates developed by personal transportation company Segway-Ninebot are to be banned on the UK's public pavements and roads. The Department for Transport (DfT) told the BBC the skates fell under the same rules as powered rideables such as electric scooters and ""hoverboards"". Segway-Ninebot said its new skates had a top speed of 12 km/h (7.5mph). However, they are classed as ""carriages"" under the Highways Act of 1835 and are banned from the pavement. The skates have a ""travel time"" of 45 minutes Video-maker Casey Neistat, who was given a pair of the skates totest in New York City,external, also faced difficulty finding places to try them out. He said he preferred riding them on smooth surfaces, but was quickly stopped riding inside Grand Central Station by a security officer. The DfT added that powered transporters were usually not allowed on UK roads. It said: ""For most powered transporters, their construction is such that they clearly would not comply with the normal vehicle construction rules or with type approval."" This would limit their use to private property with the landowner's permission. The same rules apply to electric scooters, electric unicycles and the two-wheeled ""hoverboards"". The Drift W1 electric skates were revealed in June and described by the company as ""a new trendy way to move"". On Tuesday, it revealed a pair would cost $399 (Â£303). The company says on its website: ""Rules and regulations for riding Segway products on public roads differ for every country.""

"""Inappropriate conduct"" made up more than half of all bans following misconduct hearings Sexually motivated, inappropriate conduct is the reason for a third of teaching bans, the BBC has found. A teacher who measured pupils' penises and another who stole books worth Â£27,000 are among more than 450 staff across England banned over five years. Cases included teachers kissing pupils, showing them pornography and sexual relationships. The National Education Union said the number of bans was ""tiny"" compared with the 500,000 teachers in schools. The NSPCC said safeguarding children ""must always be a top priority"" for schools. The BBC compiled and analysed National College of Teaching and Leadership (now the Teaching Regulation Agency) judgements between April 2013 and March 2018. ""Inappropriate conduct"" made up more than half of all bans following misconduct hearings, with a third of cases having a sexual element. Where a teacher's subject was specified in the judgement, the BBC's research showed physical education (PE) teachers faced the most investigations, with 23 cases, followed by music (22 cases) and science (21 cases). Male teachers accounted for about 70% of cases, of which more than half had a sexual dimension, including 10 involving sexual offence convictions and 17 related to indecent images. Among the 165 female teacher cases, 46 were for dishonesty, 37 for professional misconduct and eight for being drunk at work. Jerry Glazier, of the NUT section of the National Education Union, said: ""We all want children to be safe in our schools and only the best people in the profession."" He said the higher ban rate for male teachers reflected the types of offences committed and the respective threats they posed to students and staff. One in 10 cases involved head teachers. Cases which led to teaching bans include: London teacherPhilip Banwell was banned after calling in sick while he was really away with a pupil for two nights in Brighton,external Nottinghamshire head teacherMargaret Grettonwas banned after referring to special needs pupils as ""road kill"" Derbyshire teacher Michael Hall was banned in connection withstealing Â£180 from someone who had taken their own life,external Assistant head teacher Andrew Corish wasbanned after using a mobile phone to film up girl's skirts in Croydon,external West Sussex teacherSarah Black claimed 32 days of compassionate leave after claiming her father had murdered her mother,external. Police could find no record of such a crime having taken place. Ilford primary head teacherSophie Rahman was banned after allowing London Bridge terrorist Khuram Butt to give after-school classes Some of the teaching bans involved historical offences, including that of aRotherham primary school teacher who claimed in the 1970s to be part of a child development study,external. The teacher - Denis Hays -asked three pupils to attend his home on a monthly basis where he held and measured their various body parts including their genitalia. His activities in the 1970s only came to light in 2015, when it was reported by one of the victims, who had become a police officer. Mr Hays was subsequently dismissed. South Yorkshire Police said no charges had been brought in the case. Three teachers were banned for racism, two for voyeurism and five for exposing themselves in public. Thefts accounted for eight cases, including the theft of Â£27,000 worth of books by Nottinghamshire assistant head teacher Clare Hughes. Hughes, who was given a two-year suspended sentence in 2016, was only caught after a colleague, seeking to replace a stolen book, discovered Hughes selling the title online. Clare Hughes stole Â£27,000 worth of books while working at the Magnus Church of England Academy in Newark, Nottinghamshire The three-year series of thefts at the Magnus Church of England Academy in Newark harmed learning at the school and put already strained budgets under further stress, head teacher Gill Barker said at the time. ""Colleagues who trusted Clare Hughes had been left feeling devastated, in disbelief and betrayed,"" she said. Teachers who were not banned despite misconduct included an art teacher in Hampshire wholet two pupils paint using their own blood,externaland a head of science at Kelvin Hall School in Hull whofailed to report immediately a radioactive substance going missing from a school science lab,external. Kelvin Hall School did not respond to the BBC's questions about whether the radioactive substance was ever recovered. An NSPCC spokeswoman said: ""Safeguarding children must always be a top priority for teaching professionals - school should be a place where young people feel safe and are able to flourish. ""The vast majority of teachers do a fantastic job educating and supporting young people, and are trusted to play a key role in pupils' wellbeing. ""But when issues arise at school, it is right they are dealt with and investigated thoroughly and that the Teacher Regulation Agency continues to take inappropriate conduct very seriously."" The TRA said: ""All teacher misconduct cases are rightly judged on an individual basis, using detailed guidance on what is acceptable behaviour for teaching staff."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Heads will generally make any referral to the TRA with a heavy heart, as they know the consequences for colleagues can be career-ending. ""But heads also know that they act in in loco parentis, and will be driven by a sense of what is ethically right.""

"Comparisons are being drawn between the heatwave of 2018 and the summer of 1976. So how do the two years measure up? I had to sit my A-level exams back then, when the temperatures were so punishing we couldn't sleep. We first tried the cellar, which was cool but too claustrophobic, and then the garden, which was too exposed to the unwelcome light of dawn. I didn't realise it at the time but I was living through a heatwave that has gone down as one of the seminal events in British weather history. Mark McCarthy, of the Met Office, says: ""'76 is the yardstick we always fall back on because it was such a remarkable heatwave and drought - it's one of the standouts in our records."" It was so serious that the government of the day introduced a Drought Act and even appointed a Minister for Drought, Denis Howell, whose job was to encourage the public to use less water. The newspapers loved it when he told them he had taken to sharing baths with his wife. Staines reservoirs near London during the drought of 1976 So how does 1976 stack up against the extreme conditions large parts of the UK are now experiencing week after week? There are some striking similarities but also some key differences. Beyond the horizon, the surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean play a crucial role in determining our weather - and sea conditions back then were very like what we're seeing now. In both years, a particular pattern formed in which there is cool water near Greenland, warm water further south and then more cool water closer to the British Isles - and research has shown how that pattern of sea temperatures can be linked to warmer drier summers in the UK. And both heatwaves have involved the same kind of lingering high pressure in which temperatures can soar. How long will the heatwave last? Staying safe and cool in heatwave conditions How hot is it where you are? Your pictures from the summer of 1976 But in 1976 the high pressure system was centred further to the east of the UK than now. That had the effect of drawing up hot humid air from the south, making night-time temperatures even hotter than they have been this year. The exact location of systems such as this really matters because the UK is relatively small - so a shift one way or the other can have a big effect. So what about the actual heat? This is no comfort to anyone toiling outdoors now but 1976 was in a different league to this year. It saw an extraordinary 18 days running when somewhere in the UK had temperatures above 30C. The latest figures for 2018 show that, so far, we've had ""only"" nine days on the trot above 30C. Also, 1976 had a staggering 15 consecutive days in which temperatures topped 32C. But the biggest difference is in rainfall and what that means for water supplies. From as far back as May 1975, parts of the UK had suffered a long dry spell - so when the heatwave struck, the country was already thirsty. In Yorkshire and East Anglia, standpipes were fitted in the streets. In Wales and the west of England, supplies were turned off during the day. And dozens of companies had restrictions imposed or were told to order shorter working weeks. What about this year? It has seen the driest first half of a summer for half a century and a hosepipe ban is in prospect for north-west England. Six of the Met Office's rain gauges have received less than 1mm of rain since 29 May. Also this year, some regions have not reached even 10% of the average rain seen in June and July - although with seven days of the month left, this could change. But overall most water companies say they are happy with supplies, for the moment. Luckily last winter delivered its usual amount of rain and spring rainfall was above average. Much of the country had water in the bank when all this began. So where does that leave us? While 1976 did see more severe conditions than now, there has been a profoundly important change in the intervening 42 years: the global average temperature has crept up and is set to rise further. That makes it ""very likely"" (in the words of the UN climate science panel) that heatwaves will become more frequent in future. And this has potentially devastating implications. After the 2003 heatwave that was blamed for causing 2,000 extra deaths in the UK and tens of thousands across continental Europe, a study concluded that the temperatures of 2003 would seem normal by the summers of the 2040s. Global warming is not the only change. Since 1976, the population has soared, demand for water has rocketed and the stuff has never been so precious. Drought Minister Denis Howell framed by standpipe taps in a street in Wakefield The water companies are under pressure to fix wasteful leaks. And the rollout of water meters is designed to reduce demand - our supplies used to flow without any record of how much we used.  Water saving devices in the home also help us to consume less. Even in East Anglia, the driest region of the country, where there's less rain per person than in Jerusalem, Anglian Water has managed things so that water demand per head is lower than the UK average. Technology and awareness are combining to provide solutions. What now? The current heatwave isn't over yet. It could endure through August. More records could be set - or, as often happens during times of maximum public interest, the heavens will suddenly open and the air will cool. In the case of the minister for drought, his appointment was inevitably followed by a deluge and he was quickly made minister for floods instead (two years later Mr Howell served as minister for snow). The papers loved that too - another reason that 1976 was so memorable. Sadly, the break in the weather came too late for me and my exams. But when it came to the results, at least I had an excuse.

"Police have gathered outside the embassy building in central Beijing A man has set off a small explosive device close to the US embassy in Beijing, officials have confirmed. Apart from the attacker, there were no injuries reported and officials say police responded immediately. Video and images posted on social media show smoke rising from the vicinity of the embassy in the heart of the Chinese capital with crowds gathering. State media outletGlobal Times tweeted that local residents had heard a ""thunder-like bang"",external. A statement from the US embassy in Beijing said a device, which they described as a bomb, had exploded at around 1300 local time (0500 GMT) at the south-east corner of the compound. Beijing police called it a ""suspected firecracker device"" which caused a fire. The bomber injured his hand during the incident, but there was no danger to his life and he was immediately sent to hospital. Police gave his surname as Jiang, and said he was from the Inner Mongolia province. The BBC's Stephen McDonell at the scene says that normal activities have since resumed at the embassy, with people still lining up for visa applications. There were earlier reports that  police had taken away a woman who had tried to set herself on fire near the embassy at 1100 local time, several hours before the reported blast. It is unclear if the two incidents were linked. Attacks on sites in the Chinese capital are rare. The most serious incident in recent years sawa car ploughing into a crowd at Tiananmen Square in 2013, killing five people including the attackers. China blamed the incident on Muslim Uighur separatists.

"This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard v BBC - how did we get here? The BBC is to seek permission to appeal a ruling over its coverage of a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home. A high court judge ruled last week that the BBC infringed Sir Cliff's privacy in its reporting of the story in 2014, and awarded him Â£210,000 damages. The raid was part of an investigation into historical child sex allegations - Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged. The BBC argues the ruling could put press freedom at stake. The broadcaster will later seek leave to appeal all of the main findings of law in Mr Justice Mann's judgment - although the judge is unlikely to grant an appeal against his own ruling. BBC legal affairs correspondent, Clive Coleman, said that if he refuses, it will be up to the broadcaster to decide whether to go directly to the Court of Appeal - which he understands the corporation is ""carefully considering"". Sir Cliff Richard wins case against BBC BBC bosses should carry the can - Sir Cliff What's the reaction to the Sir Cliff case? The BBC wants to challenge the judge's findings, including that Sir Cliff had a right to privacy while a suspect in a police investigation - trumping the broadcaster's right to freedom of expression to publish his name and cover the raid. It will also seek to appeal Sir Cliff's entitlement to damages for injury to his reputation in a privacy case, as opposed to a defamation claim. The corporation will argue the Â£210,000 damages awarded will have a damaging effect on media outlets who are aware of a suspect's identity but who do not want to publish for fear of having to make a large payout. The judge has yet to decide how much Sir Cliff was left out of pocket. The singer has said plans for his professional work were ""seriously disrupted"" and that he was left ""in effect in creative limbo"" for two years. This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard's lawyer said the singer ""aimed to right a wrong"" At the ruling earlier this month, Mr Justice Mann said a suspect in a police investigation ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"", and while Sir Cliff being investigated ""might be of interest to the gossip-monger"", there was not a ""genuine public interest"" case. He also said that while the case could have a ""significant impact on press reporting"", it did not mean the law was changing or he was setting a precedent as the Human Rights Act already covers the issues at stake. After the ruling last week, the BBC's director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth apologised to Sir Cliff and said: ""In retrospect, there are things we would have done differently.""

London Fire Brigade was called to the fire on the top floor of Welbeck Mansions on Inglewood Road, West Hampstead, at about 01:00 BST. About 50 people were evacuated from the block, and two people were helped out by firefighters. The service says the fire is now under control, with 15 engines still at the scene.

"Facebook shares tumbled by more than 20% on Wednesday after the social media network's revenue and user growth fell short of investor expectations. The firm, which is facing backlash for its handling of fake news and privacy, said it had 2.23 billion monthly active users at the end of June. This was up 11% on June 2017, the slowest growth in more than two years. It also warned investors that spending growth would outstrip revenue gains in 2019, pinching profits. Facebook said it expected revenue gains to slow, as people make use of new options to limit advertising and less profitable overseas markets drive growth. The firm also plans to spend billions to improve the way it monitors content, tracks advertisers and treats user data - areas where it has faced regulator scrutiny. The firm, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, is also investing in new features, such as virtual reality and video. Facebook will not remove fake news - but will 'demote' it Instagram pins hopes on IGTV's vertical video Shares in Facebook initially fell about 12% in after-hours trade in New York, but losses accelerated as the firm outlined its spending plans. Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights, said the firm's forecast was ""nightmareish"". ""They gave a very disappointing outlook for the second half of the year and 2019 and that's going to significantly weigh on the stock in the near term,"" he said. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has appeared before regulators this year Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco This is hardly Armageddon for Mark Zuckerberg. On the whole, people are apparently not deserting Facebook. Monthly active users - ie those who interact at least once a month - were steady in the US, down ever-so-slightly in Europe, and up everywhere else. But for a company used to growing those numbers handsomely throughout the year, a lack of meaningful growth will cause concern, if not panic. Sadly the company doesn't break down its Europe numbers into anything more granular - which means we can't see the effect the Cambridge Analytica scandal had on British users. Analysts tell me they consider Cambridge Analytica a ""blip"" in Facebook's history, though another quarter like this one would be even more impactful than what we saw during Wednesday's after hours trading. During its earnings call, Facebook warned investors to brace themselves: it doesn't expect revenue growth to improve for at least the rest of this year. Facebook profits in the quarter were $5.1bn, up 31% from the same period in 2017. Revenue was $13.2bn, up 42% year-on-year, but expenses grew even faster, rising 50% to about $7.4bn. User growth has flattened in the US and Canada, key markets for the company due to the high prices ads there command. The number of EU users fell amid the rollout of tighter privacy regulations, though Facebook continued to attract new users in countries like Indonesia. Mr Ives said the popularity of Instagram should help Facebook to blunt fallout from challenges at its namesake network. In February, the research firm eMarketer estimated that the number of Facebook users under the age of 25 would fall by about 2 million this year. But it forecast that Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, would add about 1.6 million users in that age range in 2018.

"Children could be banned from owning drones weighing more than 250g as part of a proposed crackdown on misuse. They would only be allowed to fly devices heavier than that if they were owned and registered by an adult. The Department for Transport says drones weighing more than 400g can smash a helicopter windscreen, while those over 2kg can damage airliners. Other measures being considered to tackle irresponsible use include Â£300-on-the-spot fines and confiscation. Responses to the consultation will feed into a draft Drones Bill, expected later this year. The growing popularity of the gadgets - and a surge in drone-related incidents - has already led to restrictions being introduced. Drone collisions 'worse than bird hits' Toddler's eye sliced in half by drone Robots and drones take over classrooms Flying a device above 400ft or within 1km of an airport is now banned - and anyone caught breaking those rules could face a fine of up to Â£2,500 or a possible jail sentence of five years. According to Press Association research, in 2016, police forces recorded 3,456 reports about drones compared with just 283 in 2014. Incidents include rows between neighbours, prison smuggling, burglary ""scoping"" exercises and snooping accusations. The number of near-misses between drones and aircraft rose from six in 2014 to 93 in 2017. In 2015,a drone put 130 lives at riskwhen it passed directly over the wing of an aircraft approaching Gatwick. Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg said drones presented ""exciting benefits"", but further restrictions were needed stop people using the technology to cause harm.

"Michelle Beckett said ADHD nearly cost her her life Some adults wait more than seven years to be diagnosed with ADHD because of huge waiting lists, a charity has said. ADHD Action has lobbied the government to start recording adult ADHD figures, as it already does with autism. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said people with the behavioural disorder were more likely to commit crime or become suicidal. About 1.5 million adults in the UK have the condition, ADHD Action said, but only 120,000 are formally diagnosed. Dr Louise Theodosiou, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said an adult with the condition was more likely to take drugs, commit crime or end up in prison. ""ADHD is connected with higher rates of suicide, depression and other mental health needs and untreated ADHD can also impact physical health,"" she said.

Since then she has required support from mental health services and set up ADHD Action following her diagnosis. ""ADHD nearly killed me,"" she said. ""I was suicidal. How many people have lost their lives because they haven't been able to access the treatment, and understand the way their brain works?"" Ms Beckett is now campaigning for better ADHD services and through her charity became involved in the setting up of the all-party Parliamentary Group for ADHD earlier this year. NHS prescriptions for ADHD medications have more than doubled over the past decade The Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was ""determined to see improvements in access to ADHD services"" and was ""looking into how data can be collected to support quicker diagnosis and care for patients"".

" Matt Merry can’t recall the exact words his mother used to tell him he was HIV-positive. He just remembers not knowing how to react, not at first, not in front of his mum. She had sat him down at a table in the back room of their home in Rugby to break the news. Matt was 12 years old. He’d had the virus for four years, his mum explained. An injection he’d received to treat haemophilia, the bleeding disorder he was affected by, had been contaminated with it. This was 1986, at the height of the Aids epidemic, and an HIV diagnosis was perceived as a death sentence. After the first signs of infection started to show, he would probably have two years to live, the doctors told his parents. That night, as Matt lay in bed with the lights out, the numbness he'd felt all day began to ebb away. The enormity of what he'd learned finally started to dawn on him. All he knew of HIV and Aids was TV footage of skeletal-looking young men, their bodies covered in sores, wasting away in hospital wards, and he started to cry. “From that point onwards, for the rest of my teenage years, I had this stopwatch hanging over my head - and at any minute someone could push that button and start this two-year countdown until I waste away and die,” he says.There was something else Matt’s mum had said to him, too - he wasn't to tell anyone. Not friends, not teachers, initially not even his younger brother. The next time he went to school he was carrying a secret that he couldn't share. In 1986, HIV and Aids were the subjects of an all-pervasive, visceral fear. In the media, the disease was largely associated with groups such as drug users and gay men, who were routinely stigmatised at the time. Matt had heard of homes that were daubed with graffiti - “AIDS SCUM” and so on – when a rumour spread that someone living there had the condition. The panic only intensified the following year, when the government released its infamous “tombstone” adverts, which depicted Aids as an ominous, deadly presence. Looking back, Matt thinks his parents made the right decision about keeping quiet. “It wasn’t really an option to let anyone know,” he says. Sometimes other pupils gave him stick about being a haemophiliac, and he can't imagine what would have happened if news of his HIV diagnosis had got out. It had emerged that thousands had been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products, and Matt had heard of schools where parents had pulled out their children on learning that there was a haemophiliac in the class. But the burden of secrecy weighed heavily on him. “It’s so lonely going through that and experiencing that on your own - not being able to talk to anyone about it, not being able to discuss it.” He was never offered any professional support or counselling. There were no psychologists or therapists to help him cope. “I guess I could have talked to my mum or dad or brother - but it’s almost like it was so upsetting at the time that I didn’t want to talk about it, because I knew I’d just break down in tears, so I just shut it away and got on with it.” To his friends and classmates, everything seemed normal. No-one knew what was going through his head. To him, it seemed a certainty that he’d be dead by the time he was 20. He could never have a girlfriend, let alone marry or have children. His family had nurtured ambitions for him - his dad was an engineer at the Rolls Royce plant in nearby Coventry, and both parents wanted their son to do well at school and go to university. But after he learned he was HIV-positive - he would later find out that he had been infected with hepatitis C too - Matt stopped trying at school. What was the point? “Why spend all that time revising and doing homework when I’m not actually going to have a career or anything?” he reasoned. Without realising it, Matt had been caught up in what's been called the biggest scandal in NHS history - one that has resulted in the deaths of at least 2,883 haemophiliacs in the UK, according to campaigners. It's feared that tens of thousands of non-haemophiliacs could have been infected via blood transfusions, too. He’d been diagnosed as a toddler with severe haemophilia, meaning his blood was slow to clot and he would bleed for longer than other children. This, in turn, meant Matt would bruise easily and cuts would take longer to repair. Bleeds could be extremely painful and restricted his mobility - blood would fill the cavities of his joints, which made moving them all but impossible. His parents wouldn’t let him climb trees or have a BMX bicycle. Haemophilia also meant Matt could never achieve his ambition of becoming a pilot with the RAF. But during the 1970s and 80s, a new treatment for haemophiliacs became available. Injections of proteins called factor concentrates - usually Factor VIII, as in Matt’s case - helped clot their blood. It was made from donated blood plasma, and there was so much demand for it that the NHS began importing it from abroad, notably the US. Now, instead of going into hospital every time he bled, Matt had a supply of Factor VIII at home - at first, his mum would inject him, and then he learned to do it himself. He’d go on summer camps in North Wales with other young haemophiliacs, accompanied by doctors equipped with supplies of Factor VIII, and the boys could play outdoors safe in the knowledge that they’d be treated if they fell and injured themselves. But unknown to Matt and his family, much of the imported American Factor VIII was made using blood plasma donated by prison inmates and drug addicts, who were high-risk groups for viruses like HIV and hepatitis C. In many cases they had been paid for it. And because the factor products were made in huge vats from the plasma of tens of thousands of people, if just one donation was infected that would be enough to contaminate the whole batch. Warnings about imported Factor VIII had been raised as early as 1974, and the government said it would make the UK self-sufficient in factor concentrates within three years – but it didn’t. As the Aids crisis unfolded in the 1980s, the Department of Health was warned again in writing that US blood products should be withdrawn, but it wasn’t until 1986 - 12 years after concerns were first raised - that this was advice was finally heeded. When Matt’s mother was told that her son had been infected with HIV, she hadn't even realised he’d been tested for it. She’d fastidiously kept records of the batch numbers of the Factor VIII he’d been given, though. She looked back through them to 1982, when he’d been given a series of injections of proteins produced by an American company. She didn't have any school photos of him taken that year because the photographer came on one of the many days when he was ill. At school, Matt had a tight circle of close friends, but none of them knew why his grades were plummeting. He did the bare minimum for his GCSEs, scraping through with five passes. He put even less effort into his A-levels: “I just spent the two years mucking around, having fun with my mates.” In the end, he had one E grade to show for it. But despite the dire predictions that he would die within two years, Matt still appeared to be healthy, apart from his haemophilia. On 19 April 1990, just after Matt turned 16, he was assessed by a psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital. “He believes there is a 50/50 chance he will develop Aids,” the doctor wrote in his report. “He tries not to think about the future and when he does feel upset he tries to distract himself.” Matt, the report continued, had a “strong psychological defence system” but this was “easily penetrated at which point he becomes clearly distressed”. It was likely that even if he did not develop Aids in the next few years, Matt would “suffer major emotional difficulties”, the psychiatrist said. “It will be difficult for him to make satisfactory relationships with people of the opposite sex, because of the very real danger of cross-infection,” he went on. “He is already worried about this and distressed at the fact that he will not be able to have children.” It was to his parents’ credit, the report concluded, that he was coping so well. Around this time, Matt began smoking cannabis. “I just thought I’d give it a go - you know, what harm’s it going to do? The damage has already been done.” From there he moved on to speed and ecstasy. It was now the early 1990s, and Matt threw himself into the rave scene. He’d stay up all night, off his face, and then “come back home to mum and dad the next morning, eyeballs as wide as saucers, and go to bed for the rest of the day”. His parents didn’t realise what was going on at first. Then one day he came home from college and his dad pulled out a stash box filled with speed and cannabis. They’d found it in Matt's bedroom. “What’s this?” his dad asked. His mum was in tears. Matt felt like the floor had fallen out of the room. His parents wanted to know why he’d been taking drugs. “I said: ‘Well, why not? You know, I might not have long to live. I want to try and enjoy and experience as much as I can before I die.’” It wasn’t an easy point to argue with. One night, when he was 17 or 18, Matt had been out drinking in town. He was walking home with a friend when something compelled him, for the first time ever, to tell someone outside his immediate family that he had HIV. The friend was shocked, but he was understanding. “It was a case of: ‘Well, OK, it is what it is, but you’re still my mate.’” They walked past the friend’s house, and then past Matt’s house, and they carried on walking and talking it over until three in the morning. The relief washed over Matt. Over the next three or four years he began telling his closest friends, individually. As time went on it became easier - he never had a negative reaction from any of them. “What does it mean?” they’d ask. “How are you? Are you going to be all right?” But on each occasion, he anxiously weighed up whether or not he could risk sharing his secret. “I always very carefully considered who I told,” he says. It was always a case of: “Can I trust this person?” After school, Matt signed up at a further education college in Leamington Spa. He didn't see much point getting a job, and it was another excuse to muck about for a while. He spent two years there not turning up to lectures very much, and left with no qualifications to show for it. Now he was 20. Many of his friends were at university in Birmingham, so he moved there, signed on and concentrated on partying. But he sensed that he was being left behind. His friends were moving on with their lives, earning degrees, getting together with girlfriends, and Matt wasn’t. There wasn't one single moment when it dawned on him, but slowly, over time, he began thinking: I’ve had this since I was eight years old, and I was always told I’d have two years to live. ""Well, what if it’s not two years? What if it’s longer?"" It had never occurred to him that he might reach 40, let alone 50 or 60. But if his health continued to hold out he was destined for a dead-end job. He realised he had to do something in case he was still alive in 10 years’ time. He applied for a diploma course at the University of Central England and was accepted. In his first year, for the first time since his HIV diagnosis, he worked hard at it. “That was a bit of a turning point for me,” he says. His efforts were rewarded with good grades. “It was like: I can actually do this.” Eventually, the diploma led to a degree. In the meantime, he travelled regularly to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to have his CD4 cells checked – these are usually killed off by the HIV virus, but his count was still normal. Each time they'd give him his results, he’d feel relieved. He’d treat himself to a CD or a video to celebrate. But although HIV had been the focus of all his worries, the hepatitis C he had also contracted from the contaminated Factor VIII was starting to affect his liver. A biopsy revealed it was scarred and damaged. The doctors suggested he go on a 12-month course of powerful drugs, ribavirin and interferon, in an effort to get rid of the virus. Matt knew from fellow haemophiliacs that the drugs were “pretty nasty”. Some of his friends had had to quit after a few weeks because of the side effects. At first, taking the drugs was like having the flu. “You’d be curled up in bed, shivering and sweating, for 24 hours after an injection, and you’d have to repeat the process three times a week.” After a while, the side effects faded away, and at the end of the 12 months, the doctors had amazing news for him - he was clear of hepatitis C. Matt was on the move. Australia was the furthest away he could go from Rugby, from everyone he knew and his entire life up until then. And that’s where he ended up. “I think I went travelling to get away from myself,” he says. “Fresh people that don’t know me. I could be someone different. I could forget, essentially, what I’d been through over the past few years and the emotional baggage.” He moved into a two-bedroom house in Sydney with seven other travellers. A close bond quickly formed between them all. They’d work all week and party at the weekends. Telling people he had HIV seemed easier here. He would only be in their company for a short time. They didn’t know his friends or anything about his life. He was still careful about who he spoke to about it, though their reactions didn’t matter so much to him. “I think within me there was an urge to just get it out,” he says. But for the first time, he started to contemplate the idea of having a relationship. Because of his HIV status, the notion had always been a difficult one for him. His parents had drummed into him the imperative to tell prospective partners and give them a choice and it was a far more daunting prospect than telling close friends. “I met some girls out there and had relationships - brief sort of holiday things, really,” he says. The first girl he told - they’d met travelling - didn’t handle the news well. He’d told her before they first slept together, but later, as the information sank in, her feelings about it began to change. “I think she sort of lived with it for a while,” he says. Then one evening they were both in someone else’s flat with a group of friends. “I just remember, she was sort of crying and her mates were comforting her and so on, and it just went tits up from there.” After he returned to the UK from Australia, just before Christmas 2000, a thought began to occur to Matt - he might be around for a long time. “I think travelling really helped, it made me see all this stuff, meet all these different people, and I could be… not someone else, but I was free of everything,” he says - including free of preconceptions about HIV. It helped that, with the arrival of anti-retroviral  treatments, other people stopped regarding HIV as an automatic death sentence. In 2003, Matt travelled to Bournemouth for a friend's stag do. In one bar, he found he'd been separated from his friends, so he struck up a conversation with a group of young women who were standing near him. He hit it off with one of them in particular. Before Matt left to rejoin the stag party, he swapped numbers with her. They kept in touch and soon they were dating. Early in the relationship, he mentioned he had HIV and braced himself for a rejection. “It didn’t faze her,” he says. “At first I didn’t know if it had sunk in, what I’d told her. It was just like,phew.” By 2008 they were married. “It’s not bothered her whatsoever.” Liz Hooper had two husbands. The same NHS scandal killed them both.Read her story: If he'd never imagined it would be possible for him to meet someone, then having children seemed completely off the agenda. “I thought it was physically, medically, impossible,” he says. But one of his childhood friends, a haemophiliac who had also attended the camps in North Wales, told Matt he had become a father thanks to a technique called sperm-washing, a form of assisted conception. Matt inquired about it and was dumbfounded to be told by a consultant that, because his viral load was still undetectable, it would be safe for him and his wife to have a baby naturally - without sperm-washing. “I couldn't quite understand what they were saying,” he says. “I was like: ‘Do you not know what I’ve gone through the last 15 or 20 years? Do you think I’m going to subject anyone else to that?'” However low the risk of passing on the virus was, it wasn’t one he was willing to take. The NHS funded three cycles of sperm-washing, which led to the birth of a son. Matt and his wife applied for assisted conception to have a second child, but this was refused. Despite a supporting letter from Matt’s HIV consultant pointing out that he had contracted HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products suppliedby the NHS, they were told these were not “exceptional circumstances”. They had to pay for the treatment that gave them their second son. Becoming a father was life-changing for Matt. And now, seeing his own boys approach the age at which he was infected brings home the enormity of what happened to him. “It’s the only time I get emotional about the whole thing,” he says. “It makes me so angry. It’s almost a displaced anger - I don’t feel as if it was done to me, it’s as if it was done to my kids.” If he was told today that his sons had two years to live, he says, “God, I don’t know what I would do, so God knows how my parents felt.” After decades of pressure from campaigners, a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal is getting under way – but while Matt is glad it’s taking place, he feels it’s long overdue. “There’s an uproar about the tragedy of Grenfell, and rightly so, but because we’re dying quietly, individually, behind closed doors, no-one knows that,” he says. Matt looks at where he is today with amazement. His hepatitis C has gone and his viral loads of HIV are still undetectable – he’s never had to take anti-retrovirals. Of about 1,250 haemophiliacs infected with both hepatitis C and HIV due to the scandal, according to the campaign group Tainted Blood, fewer than 250 are still alive. “It really is, in terms of health outcomes, like winning the lottery,” he says. He has a family and a home in London - he thinks his career is several years behind where it should be, “but actually I'm not too hard on myself because look what I’ve done, I mean, I’m here and I've done it off my own back.” He knows that many others haven’t been so fortunate. He’s hopeful that the forthcoming inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal will deliver justice, but he won’t allow himself to gettoohopeful. “Successive governments, Labour and Conservative and Liberal Democrat, have failed to address this issue and tried to put it on the back burner or just wait until we’re dead, until it goes away,” he says. Despite the vast number of victims, the scandal commands relatively little attention because of the legacy of stigma around HIV and Aids, he believes – which is why he is telling his story. “I'm pleased with where my life is at the moment - I’ve got a brilliant family, a wonderful wife, two wonderful kids,” Matt says. “I’ve got everything to be thankful for. But I shouldn’t have to be thankful for that.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9999459
"Some see the military as a sovereign entity in its own right within Pakistan The run-up to Pakistan's general election has spawned a host of phrases in the media, including many alluding to dark forces at play. Among them are allegations that ""angels"" have been targeting ""electables"". Some of the terms being bandied about are fresh, others are old expressions with new connotations. Here are just a few. A folk expression in Urdu referring to supernatural beings called djinns - Aladdin's genie is an example - and often translated in the English press as ""angels"" or ""aliens"", sometimes as ""invisible forces"". Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has used the Urdu term(khalai makhlooq),which refers to members of the intelligence services, to criticise the military's alleged meddling in politics. The army denies the claims. Mr Sharif was ousted as prime minister a year ago and is now behind bars fighting a corruption conviction. He says the cases against him are politically motivated. Many new expressions have entered the country's political vocabulary In a speech in the weeks before he was jailed,Mr Sharif used the Urdu term to accuse the military of intimidating members of his party,external. ""The real aliens... have been there for 70 years,"" was one translation of what he said. Now the military, he said, ""is going to have a match, God willing, with humans, and humans with the blessing of God will defeat the aliens"". Asked to comment on the term ""khalai makhlooq"" at a news conference in July, a military spokesman replied in Urdu that the military were not ""celestial beings"" - they were in fact ""God's beings"". The term may be used for politicians who switch between parties and, because of their standing or clout, are seen as dependable vote banks. The PTI has been criticised for wooing large numbers of ""electables"". Its leader Imran Khan says this is essential in order to win. The other main parties, which have benefited from this system of patronage for years, say many ""electables"" have been coerced. Imran Khan says wooing defectors in only what other parties have done in the past The Urdu media are using a different word - ""lota"" - a round water pot which can easily tip over in any direction. Latest polls show a two-horse race between the PTI and the PML-N that is too close to call. An Urdu expression has been widely used in Pakistani media following the ruling that disqualified Mr Sharif. The court said he was not ""truthful and trustworthy"". The expression is similar to one inserted into the Pakistani constitution by former military ruler Gen Muhammad Zia ul-Haq in an effort to Islamicise the legal system. Critics say it gives the judiciary unwarranted power to oust elected politicians from parliament. The phrase is part of the campaigning of Islamist leaders. Sirajul Haq, vice-president of the Mutahidda Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), an alliance of mainstream Islamist parties, says their priority is to establish such a system. The MMA wants Islamic governance in Pakistan Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of the hard-line party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan, says ""the time has come"" for Islamic rule in Pakistan. This is the belief that Prophet Muhammad is the final messenger of God. The phrase was used in protests last year over attempts to amend the language of the country's election law. After Mr Sharif's disqualification, he had to step down as head of his party because the law stipulates that only those qualified to become MPs can lead parties. The PML-N government tried to amend the law. This involved rewording a document about the finality of the Prophet that election candidates are required to sign. The effort led to an uproar from the opposition, and the oath was restored to its original wording. An anthem released by human rights activist Jibran Nasir, who is standing as an independent candidate  in a constituency in the southern city of Karachi. The song highlights the struggles of ordinary Pakistanis. Nasir has the support of several celebrities who are running a social media campaign in his support.

"PML-N supporters and others accuse the military of trying to rig the election The run-up to Pakistan's general election on Wednesday has been marred by allegations of pre-poll rigging, intimidation and the muzzling of the media, writes Gul Bukhari, who was briefly kidnapped by masked men in Lahore's army cantonment area in June. Until a few months ago, protest chants accusing Pakistan's powerful military of terrorism were rarely heard in the country's main cities. But they came to central Lahore on 13 July, the day former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam returned from London to begin their prison sentences. By last Friday, the chant - ""ye jo dehshat gardi hai, is ke peehchay wardi hai"" (""the military uniform is behind this terrorism"") - could be heard on the streets of Rawalpindi, not far from military headquarters. In a stunningly brazen move, a hearing for a seven-year-old narcotics case involving Mr Sharif's PML-N party stalwart Hanif Abbasi was moved forward from August to 21 July, and a life sentence handed down at 23:30 on Saturday, four days ahead of the general election, effectively knocking him out of the race. Relief after abducted journalist Gul Bukhari is freed Where reporters face beatings, threats and death Mr Abbasi was the frontrunner in his constituency against Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who served in both Gen Zia and Gen Musharraf's governments and is an ally of Mr Sharif's arch-rival Imran Khan, who leads the PTI party. Any focus on the merits of the case was overshadowed by outrage at the timing of the verdict. Thousands attended rallies to welcome Nawaz Sharif back, but the media did not carry any of the protests in Lahore or Rawalpindi. Social media, in contrast, was flooded with pictures, videos and discussion. Imran Khan is seen as the favourite of the military Contrary to the establishment's expectations, the popularity of Mr Sharif and his party held its ground after he was ousted on corruption charges in July last year. His accusations of military interference caught the public's imagination. To counter this, a fierce crackdown on the media was unleashed. Market leader Geo Television was taken off air in April, and the distribution of Pakistan's oldest newspaper, Dawn, has been disrupted since May. After months of financial losses, Geo reportedly agreed to the security establishment's demands to self-censor and abide by strict guidelines. After this surrender, the industry as a whole fell into line and none of the media houses dared show Mr Sharif's political rallies or his daughter's fiery speeches. Why the election matters The acid attack survivor running for parliament The assault on Pakistan's media With the media on its knees, it was left to activists on Twitter and Facebook to continue the fight. The voices here remained feisty and openly angry at the judicial-military nexus, accusing them of violating their mandate and preventing voters from exercising their will in the general election. The conversation on social media continues to survive and thrive amid a terrifying onslaught of threats and abductions. Journalists, too, have taken to social media to air what they cannot on their screens or in their newspaper stories and op-eds. Mr Sharif seems to have won this round of the battle. Seen as a man who could have lived a comfortable life in exile and attended to his seriously ill spouse, he has returned to Pakistan to face certain incarceration in his fight for civil supremacy. Successive opinion polls putting him ahead against all opponents, and the social media backlash, indicate he has managed to win sympathy for himself - and resentment at attempts by the judicial-military nexus to re-engineer the political landscape. With two days to go before the election, unexpected public defiance, especially in Punjab, a PML-N stronghold and hitherto a bastion of military power, has led to redoubled efforts to tip the scales in favour of the security establishment's favourite, Imran Khan.

With dimming hopes the public will reject Mr Sharif and embrace the former cricketer-turned-politician, the courts have been redeployed at the frontlines - Mr Abbasi's shock life sentence being a case in point. Clearly, with scores of candidates disqualified, jailed or coerced away from standing for the PML-N, and journalists and social media users harassed amid an atmosphere of terror, Mr Sharif's party is no longer expected to sweep the polls come 25 July. But if his party bags anything over 90 of the 272 directly elected seats in the National Assembly, down from about 130 in 2013, it could well remain the largest party in parliament. That would be viewed as a vindication of Mr Sharif's open defiance of the military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half of its history.

"Michelle Beckett said ADHD nearly cost her her life Some adults wait more than seven years to be diagnosed with ADHD because of huge waiting lists, a charity has said. ADHD Action has lobbied the government to start recording adult ADHD figures, as it already does with autism. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said people with the behavioural disorder were more likely to commit crime or become suicidal. About 1.5 million adults in the UK have the condition, ADHD Action said, but only 120,000 are formally diagnosed. Dr Louise Theodosiou, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said an adult with the condition was more likely to take drugs, commit crime or end up in prison.

"Middle-aged people who feel dizzy when standing up from a lying-down position may be at a higher risk of dementia or a stroke in the future, a report says. The light-headed feeling is caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, which is known as orthostatic hypotension (OH). Participants with the condition in the study of 11,709 people in the USA had a significantly higher risk of developing dementia or having a stroke. However, feeling dizzy sometimes is often not a sign of a serious illness. The American Academy of Neurology studied people for an average 25 years. And the average age of the participants was 54. Study author Andreea Rawlings said OH had been previously linked to heart disease, so her team wanted to know if it could also be responsible for brain conditions. ""Measuring orthostatic hypotension in middle age may be a new way to identify people who need to be carefully monitored for dementia or stroke,"" she said.

" Matt Merry can’t recall the exact words his mother used to tell him he was HIV-positive. He just remembers not knowing how to react, not at first, not in front of his mum. She had sat him down at a table in the back room of their home in Rugby to break the news. Matt was 12 years old. He’d had the virus for four years, his mum explained. An injection he’d received to treat haemophilia, the bleeding disorder he was affected by, had been contaminated with it. This was 1986, at the height of the Aids epidemic, and an HIV diagnosis was perceived as a death sentence. After the first signs of infection started to show, he would probably have two years to live, the doctors told his parents. That night, as Matt lay in bed with the lights out, the numbness he'd felt all day began to ebb away. The enormity of what he'd learned finally started to dawn on him. All he knew of HIV and Aids was TV footage of skeletal-looking young men, their bodies covered in sores, wasting away in hospital wards, and he started to cry. “From that point onwards, for the rest of my teenage years, I had this stopwatch hanging over my head - and at any minute someone could push that button and start this two-year countdown until I waste away and die,” he says.There was something else Matt’s mum had said to him, too - he wasn't to tell anyone. Not friends, not teachers, initially not even his younger brother. The next time he went to school he was carrying a secret that he couldn't share. In 1986, HIV and Aids were the subjects of an all-pervasive, visceral fear. In the media, the disease was largely associated with groups such as drug users and gay men, who were routinely stigmatised at the time. Matt had heard of homes that were daubed with graffiti - “AIDS SCUM” and so on – when a rumour spread that someone living there had the condition. The panic only intensified the following year, when the government released its infamous “tombstone” adverts, which depicted Aids as an ominous, deadly presence. Looking back, Matt thinks his parents made the right decision about keeping quiet. “It wasn’t really an option to let anyone know,” he says. Sometimes other pupils gave him stick about being a haemophiliac, and he can't imagine what would have happened if news of his HIV diagnosis had got out. It had emerged that thousands had been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products, and Matt had heard of schools where parents had pulled out their children on learning that there was a haemophiliac in the class. But the burden of secrecy weighed heavily on him. “It’s so lonely going through that and experiencing that on your own - not being able to talk to anyone about it, not being able to discuss it.” He was never offered any professional support or counselling. There were no psychologists or therapists to help him cope. “I guess I could have talked to my mum or dad or brother - but it’s almost like it was so upsetting at the time that I didn’t want to talk about it, because I knew I’d just break down in tears, so I just shut it away and got on with it.” To his friends and classmates, everything seemed normal. No-one knew what was going through his head. To him, it seemed a certainty that he’d be dead by the time he was 20. He could never have a girlfriend, let alone marry or have children. His family had nurtured ambitions for him - his dad was an engineer at the Rolls Royce plant in nearby Coventry, and both parents wanted their son to do well at school and go to university. But after he learned he was HIV-positive - he would later find out that he had been infected with hepatitis C too - Matt stopped trying at school. What was the point? “Why spend all that time revising and doing homework when I’m not actually going to have a career or anything?” he reasoned. Without realising it, Matt had been caught up in what's been called the biggest scandal in NHS history - one that has resulted in the deaths of at least 2,883 haemophiliacs in the UK, according to campaigners. It's feared that tens of thousands of non-haemophiliacs could have been infected via blood transfusions, too. He’d been diagnosed as a toddler with severe haemophilia, meaning his blood was slow to clot and he would bleed for longer than other children. This, in turn, meant Matt would bruise easily and cuts would take longer to repair. Bleeds could be extremely painful and restricted his mobility - blood would fill the cavities of his joints, which made moving them all but impossible. His parents wouldn’t let him climb trees or have a BMX bicycle. Haemophilia also meant Matt could never achieve his ambition of becoming a pilot with the RAF. But during the 1970s and 80s, a new treatment for haemophiliacs became available. Injections of proteins called factor concentrates - usually Factor VIII, as in Matt’s case - helped clot their blood. It was made from donated blood plasma, and there was so much demand for it that the NHS began importing it from abroad, notably the US. Now, instead of going into hospital every time he bled, Matt had a supply of Factor VIII at home - at first, his mum would inject him, and then he learned to do it himself. He’d go on summer camps in North Wales with other young haemophiliacs, accompanied by doctors equipped with supplies of Factor VIII, and the boys could play outdoors safe in the knowledge that they’d be treated if they fell and injured themselves. But unknown to Matt and his family, much of the imported American Factor VIII was made using blood plasma donated by prison inmates and drug addicts, who were high-risk groups for viruses like HIV and hepatitis C. In many cases they had been paid for it. And because the factor products were made in huge vats from the plasma of tens of thousands of people, if just one donation was infected that would be enough to contaminate the whole batch. Warnings about imported Factor VIII had been raised as early as 1974, and the government said it would make the UK self-sufficient in factor concentrates within three years – but it didn’t. As the Aids crisis unfolded in the 1980s, the Department of Health was warned again in writing that US blood products should be withdrawn, but it wasn’t until 1986 - 12 years after concerns were first raised - that this was advice was finally heeded. When Matt’s mother was told that her son had been infected with HIV, she hadn't even realised he’d been tested for it. She’d fastidiously kept records of the batch numbers of the Factor VIII he’d been given, though. She looked back through them to 1982, when he’d been given a series of injections of proteins produced by an American company. She didn't have any school photos of him taken that year because the photographer came on one of the many days when he was ill. At school, Matt had a tight circle of close friends, but none of them knew why his grades were plummeting. He did the bare minimum for his GCSEs, scraping through with five passes. He put even less effort into his A-levels: “I just spent the two years mucking around, having fun with my mates.” In the end, he had one E grade to show for it. But despite the dire predictions that he would die within two years, Matt still appeared to be healthy, apart from his haemophilia. On 19 April 1990, just after Matt turned 16, he was assessed by a psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital. “He believes there is a 50/50 chance he will develop Aids,” the doctor wrote in his report. “He tries not to think about the future and when he does feel upset he tries to distract himself.” Matt, the report continued, had a “strong psychological defence system” but this was “easily penetrated at which point he becomes clearly distressed”. It was likely that even if he did not develop Aids in the next few years, Matt would “suffer major emotional difficulties”, the psychiatrist said. “It will be difficult for him to make satisfactory relationships with people of the opposite sex, because of the very real danger of cross-infection,” he went on. “He is already worried about this and distressed at the fact that he will not be able to have children.” It was to his parents’ credit, the report concluded, that he was coping so well. Around this time, Matt began smoking cannabis. “I just thought I’d give it a go - you know, what harm’s it going to do? The damage has already been done.” From there he moved on to speed and ecstasy. It was now the early 1990s, and Matt threw himself into the rave scene. He’d stay up all night, off his face, and then “come back home to mum and dad the next morning, eyeballs as wide as saucers, and go to bed for the rest of the day”. His parents didn’t realise what was going on at first. Then one day he came home from college and his dad pulled out a stash box filled with speed and cannabis. They’d found it in Matt's bedroom. “What’s this?” his dad asked. His mum was in tears. Matt felt like the floor had fallen out of the room. His parents wanted to know why he’d been taking drugs. “I said: ‘Well, why not? You know, I might not have long to live. I want to try and enjoy and experience as much as I can before I die.’” It wasn’t an easy point to argue with. One night, when he was 17 or 18, Matt had been out drinking in town. He was walking home with a friend when something compelled him, for the first time ever, to tell someone outside his immediate family that he had HIV. The friend was shocked, but he was understanding. “It was a case of: ‘Well, OK, it is what it is, but you’re still my mate.’” They walked past the friend’s house, and then past Matt’s house, and they carried on walking and talking it over until three in the morning. The relief washed over Matt. Over the next three or four years he began telling his closest friends, individually. As time went on it became easier - he never had a negative reaction from any of them. “What does it mean?” they’d ask. “How are you? Are you going to be all right?” But on each occasion, he anxiously weighed up whether or not he could risk sharing his secret. “I always very carefully considered who I told,” he says. It was always a case of: “Can I trust this person?” After school, Matt signed up at a further education college in Leamington Spa. He didn't see much point getting a job, and it was another excuse to muck about for a while. He spent two years there not turning up to lectures very much, and left with no qualifications to show for it. Now he was 20. Many of his friends were at university in Birmingham, so he moved there, signed on and concentrated on partying. But he sensed that he was being left behind. His friends were moving on with their lives, earning degrees, getting together with girlfriends, and Matt wasn’t. There wasn't one single moment when it dawned on him, but slowly, over time, he began thinking: I’ve had this since I was eight years old, and I was always told I’d have two years to live. ""Well, what if it’s not two years? What if it’s longer?"" It had never occurred to him that he might reach 40, let alone 50 or 60. But if his health continued to hold out he was destined for a dead-end job. He realised he had to do something in case he was still alive in 10 years’ time. He applied for a diploma course at the University of Central England and was accepted. In his first year, for the first time since his HIV diagnosis, he worked hard at it. “That was a bit of a turning point for me,” he says. His efforts were rewarded with good grades. “It was like: I can actually do this.” Eventually, the diploma led to a degree. In the meantime, he travelled regularly to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to have his CD4 cells checked – these are usually killed off by the HIV virus, but his count was still normal. Each time they'd give him his results, he’d feel relieved. He’d treat himself to a CD or a video to celebrate. But although HIV had been the focus of all his worries, the hepatitis C he had also contracted from the contaminated Factor VIII was starting to affect his liver. A biopsy revealed it was scarred and damaged. The doctors suggested he go on a 12-month course of powerful drugs, ribavirin and interferon, in an effort to get rid of the virus. Matt knew from fellow haemophiliacs that the drugs were “pretty nasty”. Some of his friends had had to quit after a few weeks because of the side effects. At first, taking the drugs was like having the flu. “You’d be curled up in bed, shivering and sweating, for 24 hours after an injection, and you’d have to repeat the process three times a week.” After a while, the side effects faded away, and at the end of the 12 months, the doctors had amazing news for him - he was clear of hepatitis C. Matt was on the move. Australia was the furthest away he could go from Rugby, from everyone he knew and his entire life up until then. And that’s where he ended up. “I think I went travelling to get away from myself,” he says. “Fresh people that don’t know me. I could be someone different. I could forget, essentially, what I’d been through over the past few years and the emotional baggage.” He moved into a two-bedroom house in Sydney with seven other travellers. A close bond quickly formed between them all. They’d work all week and party at the weekends. Telling people he had HIV seemed easier here. He would only be in their company for a short time. They didn’t know his friends or anything about his life. He was still careful about who he spoke to about it, though their reactions didn’t matter so much to him. “I think within me there was an urge to just get it out,” he says. But for the first time, he started to contemplate the idea of having a relationship. Because of his HIV status, the notion had always been a difficult one for him. His parents had drummed into him the imperative to tell prospective partners and give them a choice and it was a far more daunting prospect than telling close friends. “I met some girls out there and had relationships - brief sort of holiday things, really,” he says. The first girl he told - they’d met travelling - didn’t handle the news well. He’d told her before they first slept together, but later, as the information sank in, her feelings about it began to change. “I think she sort of lived with it for a while,” he says. Then one evening they were both in someone else’s flat with a group of friends. “I just remember, she was sort of crying and her mates were comforting her and so on, and it just went tits up from there.” After he returned to the UK from Australia, just before Christmas 2000, a thought began to occur to Matt - he might be around for a long time. “I think travelling really helped, it made me see all this stuff, meet all these different people, and I could be… not someone else, but I was free of everything,” he says - including free of preconceptions about HIV. It helped that, with the arrival of anti-retroviral  treatments, other people stopped regarding HIV as an automatic death sentence. In 2003, Matt travelled to Bournemouth for a friend's stag do. In one bar, he found he'd been separated from his friends, so he struck up a conversation with a group of young women who were standing near him. He hit it off with one of them in particular. Before Matt left to rejoin the stag party, he swapped numbers with her. They kept in touch and soon they were dating. Early in the relationship, he mentioned he had HIV and braced himself for a rejection. “It didn’t faze her,” he says. “At first I didn’t know if it had sunk in, what I’d told her. It was just like,phew.” By 2008 they were married. “It’s not bothered her whatsoever.” Liz Hooper had two husbands. The same NHS scandal killed them both.Read her story: If he'd never imagined it would be possible for him to meet someone, then having children seemed completely off the agenda. “I thought it was physically, medically, impossible,” he says. But one of his childhood friends, a haemophiliac who had also attended the camps in North Wales, told Matt he had become a father thanks to a technique called sperm-washing, a form of assisted conception. Matt inquired about it and was dumbfounded to be told by a consultant that, because his viral load was still undetectable, it would be safe for him and his wife to have a baby naturally - without sperm-washing. “I couldn't quite understand what they were saying,” he says. “I was like: ‘Do you not know what I’ve gone through the last 15 or 20 years? Do you think I’m going to subject anyone else to that?'” However low the risk of passing on the virus was, it wasn’t one he was willing to take. The NHS funded three cycles of sperm-washing, which led to the birth of a son. Matt and his wife applied for assisted conception to have a second child, but this was refused. Despite a supporting letter from Matt’s HIV consultant pointing out that he had contracted HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood products suppliedby the NHS, they were told these were not “exceptional circumstances”. They had to pay for the treatment that gave them their second son. Becoming a father was life-changing for Matt. And now, seeing his own boys approach the age at which he was infected brings home the enormity of what happened to him. “It’s the only time I get emotional about the whole thing,” he says. “It makes me so angry. It’s almost a displaced anger - I don’t feel as if it was done to me, it’s as if it was done to my kids.” If he was told today that his sons had two years to live, he says, “God, I don’t know what I would do, so God knows how my parents felt.” After decades of pressure from campaigners, a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal is getting under way – but while Matt is glad it’s taking place, he feels it’s long overdue. “There’s an uproar about the tragedy of Grenfell, and rightly so, but because we’re dying quietly, individually, behind closed doors, no-one knows that,” he says. Matt looks at where he is today with amazement. His hepatitis C has gone and his viral loads of HIV are still undetectable – he’s never had to take anti-retrovirals. Of about 1,250 haemophiliacs infected with both hepatitis C and HIV due to the scandal, according to the campaign group Tainted Blood, fewer than 250 are still alive. “It really is, in terms of health outcomes, like winning the lottery,” he says. He has a family and a home in London - he thinks his career is several years behind where it should be, “but actually I'm not too hard on myself because look what I’ve done, I mean, I’m here and I've done it off my own back.” He knows that many others haven’t been so fortunate. He’s hopeful that the forthcoming inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal will deliver justice, but he won’t allow himself to gettoohopeful. “Successive governments, Labour and Conservative and Liberal Democrat, have failed to address this issue and tried to put it on the back burner or just wait until we’re dead, until it goes away,” he says. Despite the vast number of victims, the scandal commands relatively little attention because of the legacy of stigma around HIV and Aids, he believes – which is why he is telling his story. “I'm pleased with where my life is at the moment - I’ve got a brilliant family, a wonderful wife, two wonderful kids,” Matt says. “I’ve got everything to be thankful for. But I shouldn’t have to be thankful for that.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.3900371
"Children could be banned from owning drones weighing more than 250g as part of a proposed crackdown on misuse. They would only be allowed to fly devices heavier than that if they were owned and registered by an adult. The Department for Transport says drones weighing more than 400g can smash a helicopter windscreen, while those over 2kg can damage airliners. Other measures being considered to tackle irresponsible use include Â£300-on-the-spot fines and confiscation. Responses to the consultation will feed into a draft Drones Bill, expected later this year. The growing popularity of the gadgets - and a surge in drone-related incidents - has already led to restrictions being introduced. Drone collisions 'worse than bird hits' Toddler's eye sliced in half by drone Robots and drones take over classrooms Flying a device above 400ft or within 1km of an airport is now banned - and anyone caught breaking those rules could face a fine of up to Â£2,500 or a possible jail sentence of five years. According to Press Association research, in 2016, police forces recorded 3,456 reports about drones compared with just 283 in 2014. Incidents include rows between neighbours, prison smuggling, burglary ""scoping"" exercises and snooping accusations. The number of near-misses between drones and aircraft rose from six in 2014 to 93 in 2017. In 2015,a drone put 130 lives at riskwhen it passed directly over the wing of an aircraft approaching Gatwick. Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg said drones presented ""exciting benefits"", but further restrictions were needed stop people using the technology to cause harm.

"Local councils and government bodies may not usually be associated with sending round ""the heavies"" to collect debts from hard-pressed families. But they are often worse than consumer creditors, can be very aggressive and quick to use bailiffs, MPs say. The Treasury Select Committee says debts and overpayments are often pursued ""over-zealously and uncompromisingly"" by councils. It calls for public sector bodies to change the way they recoup debts. The current approach risks driving vulnerable, struggling people into further difficulty, the committee says. In its report ""Household finances: income, savings and debt"", MPs single out public bodies for being behind the curve in their collection methods. It quotes evidence from Citizens Advice head of policy, Matt Upton. ""This is a point people find slightly difficult to grasp,"" he says. ""When people first hear that government collection and local authority collection is effectively worst in class, versus consumer creditors, it is quite difficult to accept emotionally. ""Government must be better than some of these rapacious firms that we hear about. ""If you talk to banks, it is because lots of organisations have realised that incredibly aggressive collection methods are not effective at getting money in the door, because people do not respond well to some of those tactics."" The Financial Conduct Authority told the committee that about a fifth of debt clients were arriving with problems paying council tax and utility bills. And Step Change, the debt charity, said it was now seeing average council tax debts of above Â£1,000 for about a third of its clients. Mr Upton, acknowledging some bailiffs could be heavy-handed. told the BBC: ""We've seen cases where people have been marched to ATMs to make payments."" He added that people can get into a relatively small amount of debt which can quickly spiral once debt collectors take over and add on fees and charges. ""I want to die. They have made me feel so ill and scared. I cannot go outside the house and I keep my windows closed even when it's hot."" This was how an anonymous debtor from Dorset said she felt after being chased for a debt by bailiffs. In another post on Taking Control, a web campaign against heavy-handed debt collection, someone from Westminster says: ""After one missed instalment on a liability order payment plan for council tax, because of ill-health, an enforcement agent left an enforcement notice while I was out. ""When I contacted him, he was gruff, dismissive and rude, referring to me repeatedly as 'darling', despite me asking him not to do so, cutting me off and being quite intimidating, threatening 'we're coming round the house'."" The treatment of a 68-year-old vulnerable widowed lady by bailiffs seeking council tax arrears was described by a debt adviser. ""The arrears appear to relate to 2013. ""The client's son has tried to get further details from the council in order to dispute the debt but so far this has not been forthcoming. ""The enforcement agents have been rude, intimidating and threatening on the phone to the client's son and have bullied him into setting up a regular payment of Â£20 on behalf of his mother."" It's hardly surprising there are calls for the public sector - that is local authorities, Department for Work and Pensions and HMRC - to sign up and commit to better, more sensitive practices. As the committee says: ""The public sector should be leading by example in their treatment of the most vulnerable."" Step Change chief executive Phil Andrew said he agreed that non-credit arrears should be included in the breathing space scheme which, if it goes ahead, could give people in problem debt a break while they sort out their finances. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""MPs are right to acknowledge that government agencies and local authorities are worst in class for debt collection, when they should be leading by example. ""Reforms in 2014 were introduced to protect people from unfair practices, with a particular focus on how bailiffs collect debt. ""It is clear these changes have failed. Citizens Advice has seen a more than 25% rise in bailiff problems since 2014 and helped 42,000 people with 98,000 issues last year. ""We need an independent regulator to protect consumers from unfair practice."" An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""Government and local authorities have a duty to collect taxpayer's money that is owed to them. ""But we know that not everyone's circumstances are the same, which is why people can get help to pay their debt in affordable instalments, reduce their payments, or take breaks entirely. ""There is always more we can do. ""That's why we set up the Fairness Group, a body of government and industry leaders, who are working to improve how debt is collected to make it fairer for everyone.""

"Boys are more likely to form friendship cliques, the study says Whether it's due to popular teen films such as Mean Girls or gender stereotypes most people imagine girls form more cliques than boys. Yet a new study contradicts this, suggesting that boys are more likely to form tight-knit friendship groups. Researchers say analysing social mixing patterns is important for infectious diseases and vaccination planning. They found that boys were more likely to mix with the same six friends over a period of six months. Girls' friendships, however, were more variable. The study, published on Wednesday in scientific journalPlos One,external, was led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in partnership with the University of Cambridge. Scientists use complex mathematical models to look at how diseases spread through social groupings. And this research could help predict more accurately how they will spread - and might one day lead to changes in advice on how infectious diseases are controlled. Researchers asked 460 Year 7 pupils across four UK secondary schools representing a range of socioeconomic areas to name the six children they spent most time with daily, between January and June 2015. Lead author Dr Adam Kucharski said: ""Showing boys are potentially more cliquey than girls, perhaps going against gender stereotypes, and that popular children remain popular over time, is an interesting social insight - but for mathematical modellers this type of information is also extremely valuable. ""Understanding age-specific social mixing patterns is vital for studying outbreaks of infectious diseases like flu and measles, which can spread rapidly, particularly among children. ""Mathematical models that predict the spread of infectious diseases are now an essential part of public health decisions for the introduction of new vaccines."" Girls' friendships are more volatile, say psychologists Another of the study's authors, Dr Clare Wenham, now assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, said: ""Kids are a very important part of looking at how diseases spread. ""Previous studies have only looked at how children mix over one day, so with this study we wanted to see how it changed over time. ""It would also be good to extend the study over a longer period to see how friendship groups changed over the years."" Dr Terri Apter, a psychologist and former Cambridge tutor, who has written extensively on teenagers and friendships, said: ""It has been observed that boys' friendships are more stable and girls' are more volatile. ""As a result, girls might feel more pressure to have 'just in case' friends in case they fall out with their best friend and they feel more social pressure to be friendly with people that aren't really their friends than boys. ""All this leads to a larger, more changeable group.""

"Mrs A has spent tens of thousands of pounds a week in Harrods on luxury goods The fugitive wife of a ""fat cat banker"" who's spent Â£16m in Harrods is battling to keep her London mansion after the UK's first use of a new power to combat international corruption. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is challenging a demand by the National Crime Agency that she reveal the source of her wealth or face losing her British properties. The hearing at the High Court is the first time the agency has used an ""Unexplained Wealth Order"" to force a suspected corrupt foreign official and his family to account for their riches. The NCA wants the couple to explain how two properties worth Â£22m were bought, amid suspicions the cash was stolen by the woman's husband while he was working for a state bank in their home country. If the woman fails to overturn the court order, or fails to prove she is legitimately wealthy, the NCA can ask the courts to seize the homes. Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs)came into force earlier this yearto help investigators identify and seize British property suspected to have been bought by cash laundered by corrupt foreign politicians and officials. The power was introduced because it's difficult for agencies to prove how these suspects obtained their wealth overseas - and that makes criminal prosecutions almost impossible. During the first challenge to an UWO, the High Court revealed that ""Mrs A"" is the wife of a state banker from a ""non-EEA country"", that also cannot be named for legal reasons. The couple have an estimated wealth of more than Â£55m ($72.5m), and 10 years ago, Mr A applied to settle in the UK under the visa scheme for wealthy investors. The first London property was bought the following year - but Mr A was subsequently jailed overseas after being convicted of a major fraud. Mrs A is also wanted for trial - but has been living what the court heard was an ""extravagant"" lifestyle in the UK, spending the vast sums her husband allegedly embezzled. Jonathan Hall QC, for the NCA, told the court that Mrs A had spent Â£16m in Harrods over 10 years. Mr and Mrs A cannot be identified for legal reasons Each week, she'd spent tens of thousands of pounds on luxury goods. Her child has their own share fund worth Â£15m. Mrs A has claimed in court papers that her wealth comes from her husband's successful overseas enterprises. But the court heard this claim is not supported in confidential papers or online profiles of the banker. Mr Hall said: ""It's an astonishing omission that if he were a titan of business, that there is no reference [on websites] to his successful business."" James Lewis QC, appearing for Mrs A, said the NCA's demand that she account for her wealth was unjustified and the agency had misrepresented her husband's career. Far from being a modestly-paid banker, Mr Lewis said that Mr A had been a stereotypical ""fat cat international banker"", similar to many others in the private sector. He'd been the victim of an unfair trial and a major miscarriage of justice, the lawyer said. ""The reality is [the NCA] have to wait years for him to come out of prison. They cannot [seek to seize the homes] when he is unable to participate. She can't call the witness she needs."" If the UWO against Mrs A stands, it's likely to pave the way for more orders against suspects, including Russian oligarchs and corrupt former politicians from Africa, with property in Britain.

"Local councils and government bodies may not usually be associated with sending round ""the heavies"" to collect debts from hard-pressed families. But they are often worse than consumer creditors, can be very aggressive and quick to use bailiffs, MPs say. The Treasury Select Committee says debts and overpayments are often pursued ""over-zealously and uncompromisingly"" by councils. It calls for public sector bodies to change the way they recoup debts. The current approach risks driving vulnerable, struggling people into further difficulty, the committee says. In its report ""Household finances: income, savings and debt"", MPs single out public bodies for being behind the curve in their collection methods. It quotes evidence from Citizens Advice head of policy, Matt Upton. ""This is a point people find slightly difficult to grasp,"" he says. ""When people first hear that government collection and local authority collection is effectively worst in class, versus consumer creditors, it is quite difficult to accept emotionally. ""Government must be better than some of these rapacious firms that we hear about. ""If you talk to banks, it is because lots of organisations have realised that incredibly aggressive collection methods are not effective at getting money in the door, because people do not respond well to some of those tactics."" The Financial Conduct Authority told the committee that about a fifth of debt clients were arriving with problems paying council tax and utility bills. And Step Change, the debt charity, said it was now seeing average council tax debts of above Â£1,000 for about a third of its clients. Mr Upton, acknowledging some bailiffs could be heavy-handed. told the BBC: ""We've seen cases where people have been marched to ATMs to make payments."" He added that people can get into a relatively small amount of debt which can quickly spiral once debt collectors take over and add on fees and charges. ""I want to die. They have made me feel so ill and scared. I cannot go outside the house and I keep my windows closed even when it's hot."" This was how an anonymous debtor from Dorset said she felt after being chased for a debt by bailiffs. In another post on Taking Control, a web campaign against heavy-handed debt collection, someone from Westminster says: ""After one missed instalment on a liability order payment plan for council tax, because of ill-health, an enforcement agent left an enforcement notice while I was out. ""When I contacted him, he was gruff, dismissive and rude, referring to me repeatedly as 'darling', despite me asking him not to do so, cutting me off and being quite intimidating, threatening 'we're coming round the house'."" The treatment of a 68-year-old vulnerable widowed lady by bailiffs seeking council tax arrears was described by a debt adviser. ""The arrears appear to relate to 2013. ""The client's son has tried to get further details from the council in order to dispute the debt but so far this has not been forthcoming. ""The enforcement agents have been rude, intimidating and threatening on the phone to the client's son and have bullied him into setting up a regular payment of Â£20 on behalf of his mother."" It's hardly surprising there are calls for the public sector - that is local authorities, Department for Work and Pensions and HMRC - to sign up and commit to better, more sensitive practices. As the committee says: ""The public sector should be leading by example in their treatment of the most vulnerable."" Step Change chief executive Phil Andrew said he agreed that non-credit arrears should be included in the breathing space scheme which, if it goes ahead, could give people in problem debt a break while they sort out their finances. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""MPs are right to acknowledge that government agencies and local authorities are worst in class for debt collection, when they should be leading by example. ""Reforms in 2014 were introduced to protect people from unfair practices, with a particular focus on how bailiffs collect debt. ""It is clear these changes have failed. Citizens Advice has seen a more than 25% rise in bailiff problems since 2014 and helped 42,000 people with 98,000 issues last year. ""We need an independent regulator to protect consumers from unfair practice."" An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""Government and local authorities have a duty to collect taxpayer's money that is owed to them. ""But we know that not everyone's circumstances are the same, which is why people can get help to pay their debt in affordable instalments, reduce their payments, or take breaks entirely. ""There is always more we can do. ""That's why we set up the Fairness Group, a body of government and industry leaders, who are working to improve how debt is collected to make it fairer for everyone.""

"The UK's three main Jewish newspapers have published the same front page, warning that a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". The Jewish Chronicle,,externalJewish News,externalandJewish Telegraph,externalmove comes amid anger over Labour's anti-Semitism code. They say the party must sign up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism. Labour says its version ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA definition. The party added the security and wellbeing of Jewish people was a priority and a Labour government would pose ""no threat of any kind"" to Jewish people. Labour's new code of conduct was approved by its National Executive Committee last week, but it has been criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs. Although it includes the definition of anti-Semitism given by the IHRA, it has not included all of the body's ""working examples"". Labour MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night. Labour 'wrong to investigate Hodge' How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded MPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism code Under the same headline, ""United we stand"", the newspapers said Labour had ""diluted"" the IHRA definition in its new code and there was a ""stubborn refusal"" from the party to accept it. They said the party had the choice of accepting the definition or ""be seen by all decent people as a racist, anti-Semitic party"". ""The stain and shame of anti-Semitism has coursed through Her Majesty's Opposition since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015,"" the papers say. Labour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge confronted Mr Corbyn in the Commons last week, reportedly swearing at him and calling him an anti-Semite. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the MP said she ""blew my top"" when she found out Labour had, despite criticism, written its anti-Semitism guidelines in such a way. ""And I thought rather than do what politicians usually do, and talk each other down behind our backs, I would go and confront him,"" she added. The party launched a disciplinary inquiry into the MP, which shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith has called ""completely absurd"". Speaking onNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast,Ms Griffith said: ""The idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn't go and say things to him is completely absurd. ""It's just not his way of dealing with things. I think we'd all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back."" Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Shadow chancellor John McDonnell felt Dame Margaret had ""misunderstood"" Labour's new code of conduct. He toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme:""I can understand why she was so angry, if that's what she believed this code had done, and I think it is a complete misunderstanding and we can resolve that amicably."" He said the issue had to be resolved quickly and that Mr Corbyn had asked Labour's chief whip and general secretary to do this. Asked about Mr McDonnell's comments, Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I hope she [Dame Margaret] has now had a chance to read the code of conduct that we agreed at the national executive, and I hope she has had time to reflect that this is a very honest endeavour to ensure we prevent any anti-Semitism rising in our party."" The Labour Party said it was ""fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations"". ""The next Labour government poses no threat of any kind whatsoever to Jewish people,"" a statement said. ""The security and wellbeing of Jewish people is a priority for our party and in government we will always ensure schools, synagogues and institutions are properly protected. ""We understand the strong concerns raised in the Jewish community and are seeking to engage with communal organisations to build trust and confidence in our party. We know there is a huge amount of work to do."" The party said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"". Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry. It followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks. The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples provided by the IHRA definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis But Labour has insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code.
