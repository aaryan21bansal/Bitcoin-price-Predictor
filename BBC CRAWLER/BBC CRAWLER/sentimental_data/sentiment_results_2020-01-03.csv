"Wigan MP Lisa Nandy has announced she is joining the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. In a letter to the Wigan Post,external, she said she wanted to ""bring Labour home"" to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds. Her announcement came on the same day Birmingham Yardley MPJess Phillips announced she was joining the race. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis are also both standing. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey are among those also expected to stand. A timetable for the leadership election - and any rule changes - is set to be decided by the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday. The contest was called because Mr Corbyn is standing down as leader following the party's heavy election defeat. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour contest timings could be crucial Jess Phillips joins Labour leadership race Ms Nandy said the ""political earthquake"" seen after the general election result had highlighted the need for a different approach within the party. She told BBC Breakfast: ""People have been telling us for some time that we can't just keeping changing the man at the top, and determining the priorities and the solutions to the problems that they face from behind a desk in Victoria Street, Westminster or Whitehall."" She said she had a ""duty"" to provide a ""different sort of leadership"" for voters who wanted an end to political parties' ""paternalistic approach"" and to take back ""control"" over their own lives. She added: ""I have the duty to stand up for those people and see if Labour can become a national force again, rooted in our communities and capable of speaking with and for those people."" She said the next Labour leader would also have to put a stop to the ""factions"" and ""in-fighting"" within the party to ""earn back"" the trust of voters. ""[They] will [have to] show people that we've changed, that we're kind and compassionate towards one another...that we have zero tolerance on issues like anti-Semitism and when we say that we believe in a more equal, compassionate society that we are walking the walk within our own party, not just talking the talk."" Lisa Nandy chose an unconventional way to launch her campaign - an open letter to constituents in her local paper. In a challenge to London-based candidates such as Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer, who will declare his candidacy soon, Ms Nandy argued that the next Labour leader should come from a community like hers. She said she agreed with the perception that many political leaders were ""unable or unwilling"" to understand places such as Wigan - and that her party must elect, in her words, someone who has ""skin in the game"". She also pledged not to indulge in faction-fighting. In her pitch to succeed Mr Corbyn, she said the response to anti-Semitism had been ""woeful"". She promised to challenge Boris Johnson with ""passion and precision"" and argued that the best way for Labour to win back lost voters was by being ""brave and bold"" rather than ""trying to look all ways"". Ms Nandy has represented the safe Labour constituency of Wigan since entering Parliament after the 2010 general election. She served as shadow energy secretary during the first year of Mr Corbyn's leadership, but was among a clutch of shadow ministers to quit their posts in 2016 following the Brexit referendum. She advocated remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign, but voted for the PM's Brexit deal in October and has argued the party's pledge to hold another referendum after renegotiating the deal alienated voters in Leave-supporting areas. She has been urging her party to concentrate on winning support in smaller towns, and suggested it should move its headquarters outside London. Ms Nandy's announcement comes afterJess Phillips joined the leadership race on Friday, stating that ""something has to change"" and ""more honesty"" in politics was required. This video can not be played Jess Phillips: Labour members are ""ready to try something different"". Ms Phillips, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, acknowledged the campaign ""won't necessarily be an easy fight"" for her, but said she thought Labour members were ""ready to try something different"". The Birmingham Yardley MP added that Labour needed a leader who would ""truly speak truth to power"" and be able to ""take on"" Mr Johnson. There will also be an election for a new deputy leader, with shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood confirming they intend to run. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has also received the backing of Ms Long-Bailey for the deputy post. Under current rules, would-be candidates for both the leader and deputy leader roles must first be nominated by more than 20 MPs. They must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions.

"General Qasem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, has been killed by US forces in Iraq The general was seen as the mastermind behind Iran's ambitions in the Middle East Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""severe revenge awaits the criminals"" behind the attack The Pentagon said President Trump ordered the killing because the general was developing plans to attack Americans Ashitha Nagesh, Max Matza, Alice Cuddy, David Molloy and David Walker  The US assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani happened barely 24 hours ago, but the reaction is still flying thick and fast. Iran has vowed retaliation, but so far there is no indication of what form that might take. President Trump said the strike was carried out to ""stop a war, not to start a war"" and that Iran was planning an imminent attack on the US. Follow all the latest updates in our main news story: And for more BBC analysis, start here: Trump's decision to authorise an air strike that killed Iran's most powerful military commander has seen tensions between the two nations escalate. In this analysis, experts debate what Trump's strategy may be: Qasem Soleimani killed: Does Trump have a strategy?

Americans are keen for more information about the draft age, exemptions and other requirements. The draft was eliminated during the Vietnam war in 1973, but American men aged 18-25 are still required to register in case a draft ever becomes necessary.

Some of President Trump's critics have questioned the wisdom of targeting Qasem Soleimani, but many people in the region are grateful for Soleimani's death. Writing forThe Atlantic magazine,external, former BBC correspondent Kim Ghattas in Beirut notes that in parts of Syria - where the government has been backed by Iran - some people are passing around trays of sweets in celebration. ""Soleimani was so central to almost every regional event in the past two decades that even people who hate him canât believe he could die,"" she writes. The Pentagon's top general has told reporters that the US had ""clear and unambiguous"" intelligence that Iran was planning a ""campaign of violence"" against Americans. According to theWashington Post,external, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley warned that the attacks ""might still happen"". He said that the danger of taking no action against Soleimani was higher than choosing to strike. ""Is there risk? Damn right thereâs risk,"" he said about possible retaliation. ""But weâre mitigating, and we think weâre taking appropriate mitigations."" The Mayor of New York City, Democrat Bill de Blasio, has held a news conference to warn city residents they are ""now potentially facing a threat thatâs different and greater than
anything we have faced previously"". Previous attacks in the city have come from non-state actors, he noted, adding that ""as of last night, we are dealing with a different reality"". He adds that ""at this point"" there is a ""de facto state of war between the United States
of America and Iran"". Other cities, including Los Angeles, Washington DC and Miami have also announced a heightened security threat.

The president began the press conference by threatening the enemies of America. ""We will find you. We will eliminate you. We will always protect American service members,"" Trump says. Gen Qasem Soleimani ""made the deaths of innocent people his sick passion"", he says, and adds that the attacks affected people ""as far away as New Delhi and London"". ""We can take comfort knowing that his reign of terror is over,"" Trump says, adding that he made the decision to kill him to ""stop a war"". ""We do not take action to start a war,"" he added. ""I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. And that particularly refers to Iran,"" he continues. The US president describes Gen Soleimani as a ""terrorist"" who was ""responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American"" civilians and soldiers. Iranian protesters seized the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, leading to a hostage crisis that lasted for over a year From the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of Iran's prime minister in 1953, to tension and confrontation under Trump, here's a look back over more than 65 years of tense relations between Iran and the US. US-Iran relations: A brief history Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has been speaking in Dubai, telling state TV that the US airstrike ""was clearly a terrorist action"". ""Iran will launch
various legal measures at the international level to hold
America to account for Soleimani's assassination,"" Mr Zarif said, according to Reuters news agency.

Defence companies have seen their stock prices rise in the wake of the targeted airstrike in Baghdad - leading some to accuse them of being ""war profiteers"". Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon all saw a boost in early market trading. But defence companies weren't alone. Gold and Bitcoin have also climbed in today's trading.  Trump will be holding a rally in Miami in less than three hours, where he will be debuting the ""Evangelicals for Trump"" coalition. The event was first announced one day after evangelical magazine Christianity Today published a scathing editorial advocating for Trump to be removed from office. The speech, which is expected to take the form of one of Trump's signature political rallies, comes amid Trump's two-week holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. It's not known whether Trump will directly address the US airstrike that killed Soleimani, but according to CNN, he will ""likely address"" the news. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders began a campaign event in Iowa decrying the ""assassination"" of Soleimani, saying ""this could lead to even more death, even more conflict, even more displacement in that area of the world"". Trump, he says ""listened to right wing extremists"" and ignored the advice of his own security advisers. Speaking in New Hampshire, his rival Pete Buttigieg, a military veteran of the Iraq war, asked ""what are the repercussions of decisions like this?"" ""This is not a game.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested and imprisoned three-and-a-half years ago on spying charges, which she denies. Mr Ratcliffe says increasing tensions have always been bad for his wife's case. ""There's probably a concern, at a selfish level, as to what this means for Nazanin's case, and the fact that tensions increasing is always bad for a solution and someone being released,"" he says. ""There's always a worry that things could get worse. And then, for my in-laws sitting in their front room in Tehran, just worrying... is this going to mean that we are stepping closer to military action."" The US Department of Defense is preparing to deploy more troops to Kuwait following the attack on Soleimani. Unnamed US officials tell US media that about 3,500 troops will be sent from the 82nd Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

""No man alive was more directly responsible for the deaths of more American service members than Qasem Soleimani."" Mitch McConnell is an ally of President Trump But Democratic Senator and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the ""gang of eight"" - those leaders within Congress who are usually briefed on classified matters in advance - had not been briefed on the air strikes. He said President Donald Trump would need congressional approval for further long-term action on Iran. ""It is my view that the president does not have the authority for a war with Iran,"" he says.

"This video can not be played Jess Phillips: Labour members are ""ready to try something different"". Jess Phillips has announced that she is joining the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. The Birmingham Yardley MP joins shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis as confirmed candidates. Other MPs considering a leadership bid include Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Mr Corbyn is due to stand down in the wake of the party's election defeat last month. Announcing her leadership bid in Grimsby, where Labour lost to the Conservatives at the election, Ms Phillips said that ""something has to change"" and that she was standing ""because I think that we need more honesty in politics"". She acknowledged the campaign ""won't necessarily be an easy fight"" for her, but she thought Labour members were ""ready to try something different"". Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership: How wide will the debate be? Corbyn urges Labour to lead 'resistance' to Tories Ms Phillips, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Labour needed a leader who would ""truly speak truth to power"" and be able to ""take on"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""I'm able to reach people... and I'm able to get people to trust me even when they don't agree with me, and I think that's what politics needs."" In a statement, she said Labour would be in ""big trouble"" if it failed to win back support among its traditional base of working-class voters. Ms Phillips also criticised the party's ""woeful"" response to anti-Semitism cases within the party. And she warned the party against ""trying to please everyone"", which she said had usually meant ""we have pleased no-one"". Under current rules, would-be candidates for both the leader and deputy leader roles must first be nominated by more than 20 MPs. They must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. A timetable for the leadership election - and any rule changes - are set to be decided by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday. Those contenders who - according to the admittedly limitedpolling,externalwe have - are more popular with the current left-wing membership would benefit from a more restricted timetable for the leadership contest. Control of the NEC in recent years has moved to the left, so it's unlikely the committee will want to be overly helpful to, say, arch-Corbyn critic Jess Phillips. But a restricted timetable wouldn't just potentially help Rebecca Long-Bailey, who has been dubbed by critics as a ""continuity Corbyn candidate"". It would likely also favour Sir Keir Starmer, whose pro-EU referendum stance and effective parliamentary performances seem to have, thus far, endeared him to a chunk of the largely pro-Remain membership. Read more from Iain At 38 years old, Ms Phillips is the youngest Labour MP to enter the leadership contest so far. She is also likely to be the only contender never to have held a position in the cabinet or shadow cabinet. She has campaigned against Brexit, despite her Birmingham Yardley constituency, which she has represented since becoming an MP in 2015, opting for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey have said they are considering running. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy - who resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 after the Brexit referendum - is also considering throwing her hat into the ring.

"A US judge has awarded $12.8m (Â£9.8m) to 22 unnamed women,ruling,externalthat they were tricked into appearing in widely distributed online porn videos. Some of the models duped by the owners and operators of the GirlsDoPorn website had become suicidal, he said. They were told the videos were for a private collector or overseas DVDs, according to the 181-page judgement. The women - aged 18-23 when they shot the videos - were also assured the videos would never appear online. But they were uploaded to GirlsDoPorn's subscription-based amateur porn website, and clips were shared on some of the world's most popular free-to-view adult websites. San Diego Superior Court Judge Kevin Enright ordered GirlsDoPorn chief executive Michael Pratt, 36, videographer Matthew Wolfe, 37, and porn actor Ruben Garcia, 31, to take the videos down from GirlsDoPorn and take steps to get them removed from other sites too. GirlsDoPorn markets itself on the premise that the women in the videos are not professional porn stars. It claims to feature women filming their first and only porn videos, and many of the women on the site are students in need of extra money, according to court documents. Due to the one-time-only amateur paradigm, GirlsDoPorn required a constant stream of new models to keep the content on the website fresh. The San Diego court ruled that the site used fraudulent practices to recruit new models including taking ""calculated steps to falsely assure prospective models that their videos will never be posted online, come to light in the United States, or be seen by anyone who might known them"". The website operators had also assured models that their real names would never be linked to the videos. However, the court heard evidence that the accused had shared private and identifying information about the models on third-party forums that resulted in some of them and their families, being harassed online. In a bid to recruit new talent, GirlsDoPorn persuaded former models to text words of reassurance to prospective models who were worried that the videos might be posted online. On the day of the shoot, models were often given alcohol and cannabis before being asked to sign an eight-page contract. Judge Enright awarded the 22 women $9.48m in compensatory damages and $3.3m in punitive damages. Each woman will receive $300,000 to $550,000. He said that the videos had become common knowledge to the women's friends and family due to the tactics used by those behind GirlsDoPorn. ""As a result, plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer far-reaching and often tragic consequences,"" he wrote. ""Collectively, they have experienced severe harassment, emotional and psychological trauma, and reputational harm; lost jobs, academic and professional opportunities and family and personal relationships; and had their lives derailed and uprooted,"" he continued. ""They have become pariahs in their communities. Several plaintiffs have become suicidal."" Judge Enright gave both sides 15 days to appeal against his decision. The defendants also face criminal chargesfiled in federal court,externalin October. The allegations filed against them are the same as those in the civil case. Wolfe and Garcia are currently in federal custody. Pratt is a fugitive believed to be in New Zealand, his home country. ""Our clients were real,"" said Ed Chaplin, the lawyer representing the women,according to CourtHouseNews,external. ""They had similar stories because the defendants told the same lies to everyone,"" he said. ""I sat and talked to a lot of women. My heart just wept for them, how their lives have been impacted by this and how they were sucked into doing what they did. ""The attitude these defendants expressed when the women complained [and] the scheme to shut them up was despicable.""

"Travel money services for several UK banks are still being affected after foreign currency seller Travelex took its site offline to deal with a cyber attack. On Thursday evening, Travelex said it had taken down its site to contain ""the virus and protect data"". That has affected Sainsbury's Bank, Barclays and HSBC, among others, which all use the Travelex platform. There is no indication when the Travelex website will be restored. The company said it has been working on the issue since the software virus attack on New Year's Eve. A number of banks depend on the Travelex platform to provide online travel money services. The company delivers the foreign currency to stores for customers to collect, as well as operating the software that is used to buy the travel money. ButTravelex's decision to take down its sitehas meant the firms that use its services cannot sell currency online. Virgin Money's site showed an error message, which said: ""Our online, foreign currency purchasing service is temporarily unavailable due to planned maintenance. The system will be back online shortly."" Sainsbury's Bank also said its online travel money services were unavailable, although it said customers could still buy travel money in its stores. In a statement to the BBC, the bank said: ""We're in close contact with Travelex so that we can resume our online service as soon as possible."" Meanwhile, a spokesperson for First Direct, which is owned by HSBC, said: ""Unfortunately, our online travel money service is currently unavailable due to a service issue with third party service provider, Travelex."" In a statement on Thusday, Travelex boss Tony D'Souza said: ""We regret having to suspend some of our services in order to contain the virus and protect data."" The company has resorted to carrying out transactions manually, providing foreign-exchange services over the counter in its branches. ""We apologise to all our customers for any inconvenience caused as a result,"" Mr D'Souza said in a statement. HSBC told the BBC that some of its branches also stock dollars and euros, which it is still able to sell.

"Iran's missile capabilities are a key part of its military prowess Iran has launched more than a dozen missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US forces. It had vowed to retaliate after its most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike at Baghdad airport. So what do we know about Iran's military capabilities? Iran's missile systems are a key part of its military arsenal given its relative lack of air power. Regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia have the technology to carry out precision air strikes. Iran largely lacks this capability and so relies on launching missiles. A US Defense Department report describes the country's missile forces as the largest in the Middle East. It's not possible to give precise figures but the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says Iran has thousands of missiles of more than a dozen different types. An Iranian media outlet reported that Fateh and Qiam missiles were used in the attack on the US base. Military analysts have also pointed to the use of these types based on images of the attack sites. The Qiam-1 missile has been widely produced since 2011, has a range of up 700km and a payload (an indication of how much explosive material it can carry) of 750kg.  It was used by Iran against IS fighters in June 2017. The Fateh class of missiles, which first went into service in the early 2000s, have a slightly lower payload. The variations of theShahab-3,externalintermediate range ballistic missile have payloads of more than 750kg and ranges upwards of 1,500km. For comparison, a US-built F35 fighter jet has a payload of up to 10,000kg. Iran has up to 50 medium range ballistic missile launchers and up to 100 short range ballistic missile launchers, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. Iran is also testing space technology to allow it to develop longer range inter-continental missiles, according to the US report. ""Iran has a highly developed missile force with weapons of a variety of ranges"" says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. ""They are reasonably accurate - but not as accurate or as reliable as advanced western systems."" What is the Patriot missile defence system? The long-range missile programme was put on hold by Iran following the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), but this may now have resumedgiven the uncertainty surrounding that deal. In any case, many targets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be within range of Iran's current short and medium-range missiles, and possibly targets in Israel as well. In May last year, the US deployed a Patriot anti-missile defence system to the Middle East as tensions with Iran increased. This is meant to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. There are an estimated 523,000 active Iranian personnel, according to the IISS. This includes 350,000 in the regular army, and at least 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are a further 20,000 service personnel in the IRGC's naval forces. This group operates a number of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz, the site of several confrontations involving foreign-flagged tankers in 2019. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran The IRGC also controls the Basij unit, a volunteer force which has helped suppress internal dissent. This unit can potentially mobilise many hundreds of thousands of personnel. The IRGC has its own navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the Islamic system in Iran and has become a major military, political and economic force in its own right. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq Despite having fewer troops than the regular army, it is considered the most authoritative military force in Iran. The Quds Force, which was led by General Soleimani, conducts secret operations abroad for the IRGC and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It's believed to be about 5,000 strong. The unit has been deployed to Syria, where it advised military elements loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and armed Shia militias fighting with them. In Iraq, it has supported a Shia-dominated paramilitary force which assisted in the defeat of IS. However, the US says the Quds force has a wider role by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment to organisations that Washington has designated as terrorist groups in the Middle East. These include Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's IRGC detained the British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 Economic problems and sanctions have hampered Iran's arms imports, which are relatively small compared to those of other countries in the region. The value of Iran's defence imports between 2009 and 2018 was equivalent to just 3.5% of Saudi Arabia's imports over the same period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Most Iranian imports come from Russia, and the rest from China. Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapons programme, and has previously said it does not want one. But it does have many of the elements required and the knowledge to create a military nuclear capability. In 2015, the US government under President Obama estimated that Iran only needed two to three months to produce enough nuclear material to make a weapon. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why do uranium enrichment limits matter? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead? The nuclear agreement that year between Tehran and six world powers - from which President Trump withdrew in 2018 -  introduced limits and international checks on Iran's nuclear activities. It aimed to make it more difficult and time consuming to develop weapons-grade material. Following the killing of General Soleimani by US forces, Iran has said it will not be bound by these restrictions. But it also says it will continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Despite years of sanctions, Iran has also been able to develop drone capabilities. In Iraq, Iranian drones have been used since 2016 in the fight against IS. Iran has also entered Israeli airspace with armed drones operated from bases in Syria, according to Rusi. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its drone technology to its allies and proxies in the region, says Jonathan Marcus,the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. In 2019, drone and missile attacks damaged two key Saudi oil facilities. Both the US and Saudi Arabia linked these attacks to Iran, although Tehran denied any involvement and pointed to a claim of responsibility by rebels in Yemen. Following a major cyber-attack in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran ramped up its own cyber-space capability. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is believed to have its own cyber-command, working on commercial and military espionage. In 2012, US officials blamed Iran for a series of cyber attacks on US banks intended to disrupt traffic to their websites. A US military report in 2019 said Iran had also targeted aerospace companies, defence contractors, energy and natural resource companies and telecommunications firms for cyber-espionage operations around the world. Also in 2019, Microsoft said a hacker group that ""originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government""targeted a US presidential campaign and tried to break into the accounts of American government officials.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Jess Phillips: Labour members are ""ready to try something different"". Jess Phillips has announced that she is joining the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. The Birmingham Yardley MP joins shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis as confirmed candidates. Other MPs considering a leadership bid include Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Mr Corbyn is due to stand down in the wake of the party's election defeat last month. Announcing her leadership bid in Grimsby, where Labour lost to the Conservatives at the election, Ms Phillips said that ""something has to change"" and that she was standing ""because I think that we need more honesty in politics"". She acknowledged the campaign ""won't necessarily be an easy fight"" for her, but she thought Labour members were ""ready to try something different"". Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership: How wide will the debate be? Corbyn urges Labour to lead 'resistance' to Tories Ms Phillips, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Labour needed a leader who would ""truly speak truth to power"" and be able to ""take on"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""I'm able to reach people... and I'm able to get people to trust me even when they don't agree with me, and I think that's what politics needs."" In a statement, she said Labour would be in ""big trouble"" if it failed to win back support among its traditional base of working-class voters. Ms Phillips also criticised the party's ""woeful"" response to anti-Semitism cases within the party. And she warned the party against ""trying to please everyone"", which she said had usually meant ""we have pleased no-one"". Under current rules, would-be candidates for both the leader and deputy leader roles must first be nominated by more than 20 MPs. They must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. A timetable for the leadership election - and any rule changes - are set to be decided by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday. Those contenders who - according to the admittedly limitedpolling,externalwe have - are more popular with the current left-wing membership would benefit from a more restricted timetable for the leadership contest. Control of the NEC in recent years has moved to the left, so it's unlikely the committee will want to be overly helpful to, say, arch-Corbyn critic Jess Phillips. But a restricted timetable wouldn't just potentially help Rebecca Long-Bailey, who has been dubbed by critics as a ""continuity Corbyn candidate"". It would likely also favour Sir Keir Starmer, whose pro-EU referendum stance and effective parliamentary performances seem to have, thus far, endeared him to a chunk of the largely pro-Remain membership. Read more from Iain At 38 years old, Ms Phillips is the youngest Labour MP to enter the leadership contest so far. She is also likely to be the only contender never to have held a position in the cabinet or shadow cabinet.

"A US judge has awarded $12.8m (Â£9.8m) to 22 unnamed women,ruling,externalthat they were tricked into appearing in widely distributed online porn videos. Some of the models duped by the owners and operators of the GirlsDoPorn website had become suicidal, he said. They were told the videos were for a private collector or overseas DVDs, according to the 181-page judgement. The women - aged 18-23 when they shot the videos - were also assured the videos would never appear online. But they were uploaded to GirlsDoPorn's subscription-based amateur porn website, and clips were shared on some of the world's most popular free-to-view adult websites. San Diego Superior Court Judge Kevin Enright ordered GirlsDoPorn chief executive Michael Pratt, 36, videographer Matthew Wolfe, 37, and porn actor Ruben Garcia, 31, to take the videos down from GirlsDoPorn and take steps to get them removed from other sites too. GirlsDoPorn markets itself on the premise that the women in the videos are not professional porn stars. It claims to feature women filming their first and only porn videos, and many of the women on the site are students in need of extra money, according to court documents. Due to the one-time-only amateur paradigm, GirlsDoPorn required a constant stream of new models to keep the content on the website fresh. The San Diego court ruled that the site used fraudulent practices to recruit new models including taking ""calculated steps to falsely assure prospective models that their videos will never be posted online, come to light in the United States, or be seen by anyone who might known them"". The website operators had also assured models that their real names would never be linked to the videos. However, the court heard evidence that the accused had shared private and identifying information about the models on third-party forums that resulted in some of them and their families, being harassed online. In a bid to recruit new talent, GirlsDoPorn persuaded former models to text words of reassurance to prospective models who were worried that the videos might be posted online. On the day of the shoot, models were often given alcohol and cannabis before being asked to sign an eight-page contract. Judge Enright awarded the 22 women $9.48m in compensatory damages and $3.3m in punitive damages. Each woman will receive $300,000 to $550,000. He said that the videos had become common knowledge to the women's friends and family due to the tactics used by those behind GirlsDoPorn. ""As a result, plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer far-reaching and often tragic consequences,"" he wrote. ""Collectively, they have experienced severe harassment, emotional and psychological trauma, and reputational harm; lost jobs, academic and professional opportunities and family and personal relationships; and had their lives derailed and uprooted,"" he continued. ""They have become pariahs in their communities. Several plaintiffs have become suicidal."" Judge Enright gave both sides 15 days to appeal against his decision. The defendants also face criminal chargesfiled in federal court,externalin October. The allegations filed against them are the same as those in the civil case. Wolfe and Garcia are currently in federal custody. Pratt is a fugitive believed to be in New Zealand, his home country. ""Our clients were real,"" said Ed Chaplin, the lawyer representing the women,according to CourtHouseNews,external. ""They had similar stories because the defendants told the same lies to everyone,"" he said. ""I sat and talked to a lot of women. My heart just wept for them, how their lives have been impacted by this and how they were sucked into doing what they did. ""The attitude these defendants expressed when the women complained [and] the scheme to shut them up was despicable.""

"Oil prices have risen sharply after the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq. Analysts warned the action could escalate tensions in the region and affect global oil production. The price of Brent crude jumped by more than 3% and at one point hit $69.50 a barrel, the highest since September. It came afterGeneral Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strikeat Baghdad airport, which the Pentagon described as ""defensive action"". The price spike pushed oil stocks on the London stock exchange higher, with BP up 2.7% and Royal Dutch Shell nearly 1.9% higher. Live: Reaction and analysis as Iran vows 'revenge' Why the US had Gen Soleimani in its sights Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? A brief history of US-Iran relations Shares in US oil companies such as Exxon Mobil dropped, however, amid a wider US market fall prompted by weak manufacturing data and concerns about the implications of the Middle East conflict. The Dow and the Nasdaq closed down about 0.8%, while the S&P 500 dropped by 0.7%. The declines followed record highs a day earlier. ""2020 opened on a very positive note,"" said Aneeka Gupta of WisdomTree Investments. ""This event has actually stalled the bullish optimism we've seen."" Tensions between the US and Iran have been rising since 2018, when the US pulled out of a nuclear deal meant to curb Iran's nuclear programme and prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. The US also re-imposed sanctions on Iran, a move that has shattered the country's economy and severely restricted its oil exports. This recent strike has sparked fears of increased risk to energy supplies in the region. The price of the international benchmark, Brent Crude, climbed 3.5% on Friday, while US oil - known as West Texas Intermediate - increased about 3%. That rise is somewhat muted, suggesting that investors expect the reaction to the killing will be contained, said Adnan Mazarei, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director for the Middle East at the International Monetary Fund. But if the strike leads to wider military confrontation, as he expects, that could prompt an even bigger spike in prices. ""It is not likely that this issue will just die out,"" he said. ""I expect the most likely scenario is a pick-up in the tensions ... and if that happens, [there will be] a more sustained increase in the price of oil."" The Middle East is home to several of the world's biggest oil producers, including Iraq, where the US and Iran have clashed before. As much as a fifth of global supplies pass through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage which provides access to the Persian Gulf. Mr Mazarei said the economies of other countries in the region, such as Lebanon, are also vulnerable, with investors and businesses at home and abroad likely to curtail activity amid uncertainty about how the US-Iranian conflict will play out. ""This set of recent events is ... in some ways going to create significant troubles for the region in terms of economic performance,"" Mr Mazarei said. ""One should expect considerable social pressures and hardship."" Even if tensions subside, Caroline Bain, analyst at Capital Economics, said that the firm expects the price of oil to move higher this year due to ""output restraint, slower growth in US oil production and a gradual pick-up in global economic growth"". Analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent The potential disruption to the global oil market from conflict in the Gulf is severe. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that 21% of oil used in 2018 passed through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage which has Iran on its northern shore. Some of the biggest producers would be affected if the Strait could not be safely navigated. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, UAE and Qatar all ship some or all of their exports via the Strait. Saudi and the UAE have pipelines that bypass the Strait but they have nowhere near the capacity to take all the oil. There is also the possibility of Iranian military action against other countries' oil installations. Last year there was a drone attack on the Saudi industry. Houthi rebels from Yemen claimed responsibility and they are widely seen as having Iranian backing. Previous episodes of Middle East conflict have seen higher oil prices which contributed to global economic slowdowns, from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. What is different now, and what might moderate the impact, is the presence of the US shale industry, which can respond relatively quickly to supply shortfalls and higher prices.

"Oil prices have risen sharply after the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq. Analysts warned the action could escalate tensions in the region and affect global oil production. The price of Brent crude jumped by more than 3% and at one point hit $69.50 a barrel, the highest since September. It came afterGeneral Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strikeat Baghdad airport, which the Pentagon described as ""defensive action"". The price spike pushed oil stocks on the London stock exchange higher, with BP up 2.7% and Royal Dutch Shell nearly 1.9% higher. Live: Reaction and analysis as Iran vows 'revenge' Why the US had Gen Soleimani in its sights Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? A brief history of US-Iran relations Shares in US oil companies such as Exxon Mobil dropped, however, amid a wider US market fall prompted by weak manufacturing data and concerns about the implications of the Middle East conflict. The Dow and the Nasdaq closed down about 0.8%, while the S&P 500 dropped by 0.7%. The declines followed record highs a day earlier. ""2020 opened on a very positive note,"" said Aneeka Gupta of WisdomTree Investments. ""This event has actually stalled the bullish optimism we've seen."" Tensions between the US and Iran have been rising since 2018, when the US pulled out of a nuclear deal meant to curb Iran's nuclear programme and prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. The US also re-imposed sanctions on Iran, a move that has shattered the country's economy and severely restricted its oil exports. This recent strike has sparked fears of increased risk to energy supplies in the region. The price of the international benchmark, Brent Crude, climbed 3.5% on Friday, while US oil - known as West Texas Intermediate - increased about 3%. That rise is somewhat muted, suggesting that investors expect the reaction to the killing will be contained, said Adnan Mazarei, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director for the Middle East at the International Monetary Fund. But if the strike leads to wider military confrontation, as he expects, that could prompt an even bigger spike in prices. ""It is not likely that this issue will just die out,"" he said. ""I expect the most likely scenario is a pick-up in the tensions ... and if that happens, [there will be] a more sustained increase in the price of oil."" The Middle East is home to several of the world's biggest oil producers, including Iraq, where the US and Iran have clashed before. As much as a fifth of global supplies pass through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage which provides access to the Persian Gulf. Mr Mazarei said the economies of other countries in the region, such as Lebanon, are also vulnerable, with investors and businesses at home and abroad likely to curtail activity amid uncertainty about how the US-Iranian conflict will play out. ""This set of recent events is ... in some ways going to create significant troubles for the region in terms of economic performance,"" Mr Mazarei said. ""One should expect considerable social pressures and hardship."" Even if tensions subside, Caroline Bain, analyst at Capital Economics, said that the firm expects the price of oil to move higher this year due to ""output restraint, slower growth in US oil production and a gradual pick-up in global economic growth"". Analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent The potential disruption to the global oil market from conflict in the Gulf is severe. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that 21% of oil used in 2018 passed through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage which has Iran on its northern shore. Some of the biggest producers would be affected if the Strait could not be safely navigated. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, UAE and Qatar all ship some or all of their exports via the Strait. Saudi and the UAE have pipelines that bypass the Strait but they have nowhere near the capacity to take all the oil. There is also the possibility of Iranian military action against other countries' oil installations. Last year there was a drone attack on the Saudi industry. Houthi rebels from Yemen claimed responsibility and they are widely seen as having Iranian backing. Previous episodes of Middle East conflict have seen higher oil prices which contributed to global economic slowdowns, from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. What is different now, and what might moderate the impact, is the presence of the US shale industry, which can respond relatively quickly to supply shortfalls and higher prices.

"The old brand of Lidl's Frosted Flakes - featuring a cartoon lion - and the new brand Lidl has said it will remove cartoon characters from its own-brand cereals to help parents buy healthy products. It hopes that the rebranded packaging, to be introduced in the spring, will alleviate the pressure of children's ""pester power"". Health experts welcomed the move but called for government regulations on ""junk food marketing"". A group of MPs has previously recommended a ban on cartoons on unhealthy foods. Lidl said it will rebrand eight of its own-brand Crownfield products in total, including Choco Shells, which features two cartoon penguins on the box, and Rice Snaps, which is advertised with a grinning cartoon crocodile. The new packaging will be free from cartoons. 'Ban snacking on public transport' Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Is it time to treat sugar like smoking? 'Ban cartoon characters' on unhealthy food Georgina Hall, the retailer's head of corporate social responsibility said it wants to help parents ""make healthy and informed choices"" about the food they buy for their children. ""We know pester power can cause difficult battles on the shop floor and we're hoping that removing cartoon characters from cereal packaging will alleviate some of the pressure parents are under,"" she said.

""We know that the use of cartoon characters on sugary products is a marketing technique used by the food industry to put their unhealthy products firmly centre stage in children's minds,"" she said. However, she noted that more needs to be done than one retailer changing a category of products.

"House prices rose by 1.4% over the course of 2019, according to the Nationwide, marking a relatively static year for property values. The rise in the year to the end of December was the first time the annual increase in prices was above 1% for the whole year. Slow price growth would be welcomed by many first-time buyers. But the building society's figures show that raising a deposit remains a significant hurdle. To raise a deposit of 20% would take up the entire pre-tax annual income of a typical earner, the Nationwide said. The UK cities where rent is rising the fastest Most-viewed mansions of 2019 revealed The building society, which draws the figures from its own mortgage data, said that house prices rose by 0.1% in December compared with the previous month. This meant the average home was valued at Â£215,282. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that housing market activity had been slow but relatively stable during the year. Strong employment levels and historically cheap mortgages had maintained demand despite uncertainty in the economy, owing to the global picture and the debate over Brexit. Homes are being built for first-time buyers Commentators suggest the result of the general election should provide some short-term clarity over the Brexit process and some more demand for housing. ""These are early days for a bruised and fragile market, but with plenty of pent-up demand and supply, price growth may quickly accelerate past 2019's modest annual pace,"" said Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. ""Nevertheless these first few months of 2020 will be all about establishing what the new norm really looks like in different parts of the UK."" Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of lender Octane Capital, said: ""London may have been the weakest performing region in 2019 but that may well change this year. The capital certainly won't be returning to the obscene growth rates of yesteryear but it may drag itself off the bottom of the table. ""The property market has entered 2020 on a positive note but all eyes will be on how the economy holds up as we exit the EU."" Potential first-time buyers will not want prices to rocket, given the difficulty already in saving for a deposit. The Nationwide suggests that anyone trying to put money aside for a 20% deposit to buy a typical first-time buyer property faces years of saving. If they set aside 15% of their take-home pay each month it would take more than five years to raise the money for a home in the North of England and Scotland. In Wales and Northern Ireland, it would take prospective buyers nearly seven years, and almost eight years for people living in the West Midlands. That increases to nearly a decade in the South of England, and around 15 years in London, the building society said.

"The northernmost Orkney island, North Ronaldsay, is home to just 50 people and 2,000 sheep. Since the 19th Century, when islanders built a stone wall to confine the flock to the shoreline, it has survived on seaweed alone - and it now seems that this special diet could hold the key to greener, more climate-friendly livestock farming. ""It's a bit like doing a jigsaw,"" laughs Sian Tarrant as she heaves another large stone on to the wall. ""Only there are no straight edges and some of these pieces are really heavy."" The wind, which has been viciously squally all morning, punches at our faces and blasts the smaller slates on Sian's rock pile until they shudder and rattle like teeth. ""My contract is for three years,"" she tells me, securing her flying hair under her bobble hat. ""I really hope I can finish repairing the wall by then!"" Twenty-eight-year-old Sian is North Ronaldsay's great hope. Back in the summer, she successfully answered an advertisement to become the island's sheep warden, but shepherding is not her only responsibility - she must also repair the 21km dry stone dyke that circles the island just above the shoreline. It's this wall that has stopped her flock from eating grass, and made it utterly unique. ""But I will admit,"" she says, wiping her eyes which the wind is relentlessly needling, ""until I started researching I had no idea how special the sheep were."" Dr Kevin Woodbridge, the island's retired GP and member of the Sheep Court - the management body that oversees the flock - has never been in any doubt of this. Short-tailed, small and coloured white, grey or chocolate brown, the sheep are descendants of the most primitive breeds of ruminants, Kevin says, and have been living on the island for thousands of years. At the sound of our boots on the pebbles, the timorous flock wheels round and shoots off, leaping bits of rope and debris left by the tide. Kevin laughs and tells me, a little self-consciously, that he's sure the sheep are more intelligent than most and certainly more devious. ""I mean, just look at this wild habitat they live in,"" he says, nodding at the rocky beach and the sulky steel-grey sky with its bulging, herniating clouds. ""You have to be pretty adaptable to survive this."" And the sheep certainly have adapted. Since 1832, when the islanders decided to build the 2m-high dyke to keep the sheep from pasture they needed for cows, the flock's diet has been restricted to seaweed foraged from the shore. They are one of only two groups of animals on Earth that exist purely on seaweed; the other is a marine iguana which lives in the Galapagos Islands. ""People think seaweed isn't very nutritious,"" smiles sheep farmer Alison Duncan, who also runs the Bird Observatory, as we drive round the little island in her electric car, checking up on the sheep. ""But we never have to feed the sheep and just have a look at them - they get pretty fat on it, especially in winter when there's lots of fresh seaweed washed up. And the lambs have a pretty good life - we don't send them for slaughter until they're three or four years old."" We park up and trudge over the fields towards the coastline, where the sheep are grazing, our heads low against the buffeting all-prevailing wind. We startle a chunky little woodcock that's sheltering in the long grass and it twitters its indignation shrilly. Listen to Emma Jane Kirby's report for BBC Radio 4 on the World At One next week Browse programme highlights here ""The sheep's peculiar diet gives their meat a fuller, more gamey flavour,"" shouts Alison over the gusts. ""And it's really sought after now, not only by local chefs in Orkney but also in big London hotels, and it's quite a delicacy."" In fact, North Ronaldsay mutton was served to the Queen on her Diamond Jubilee and is now in the process of acquiring Protected Geographical Indication status from the EU, like Wensleydale cheese and Jersey royal potatoes. But lately the sheep have been enjoying even greater fame. Studies from the US, New Zealand and Australia have shown that livestock that have some seaweed in their diets belch far less methane than animals fed on grass or general feed. And since methane is a greenhouse gas that has a warming effect almost 30 times as powerful as that of carbon dioxide, the solely seaweed-eating North Ronaldsay sheep could provide an answer to greener farming. At Shotts, outside Glasgow, David Beattie takes me to the see the giant bins being filled at the Davidson's Animal Feeds mill. David will be spending the next three years studying how protein-rich seaweed could be introduced into general livestock feed. Part of a Knowledge Transfer Partnership which couples academia with industry, David is dividing his time between the factory floor at Davidson's and his laboratory at the James Hutton Institute in Dundee. ""You'd be amazed how picky animals are about their food,"" he explains, as we examine a new mix of sugary-smelling sheep pellets the mill has just produced. ""We have to put molasses into the mix to get the animals to eat it - otherwise they just pick out the bits they like and leave the rest. So, it's quite a task to introduce seaweed into the feed and to make sure it's still protein-rich and of top quality."" In a year, a cow produces about the same greenhouse effect as a car that burns 1,000 litres of petrol, so it's fairly evident how beneficial it would be to reduce livestock's carbon hoof-print simply by altering their diet. Experiments have shown that carbon dioxide as well as methane emissions are lowered when seaweed is introduced into feed. And if he succeeds in creating a nutritious seaweed blend that's palatable to ordinary livestock there would be other environmental benefits too, including being able to source more animal feed locally and sustainably. ""A large proportion of the ingredients we put into animal feeds in the UK at the moment are sourced from across the world, like oil seed from South America,"" says David, showing me the empty fleet of lorries waiting to take the giant sacks of pellets to farms across the UK. ""This clearly has negative implications for the environment both in terms of farming methods to harvest that crop but also in terms of transportation. If we could identify a seaweed variant that could substitute oil seed, it would have a huge environmental benefit."" While the North Ronaldsay sheep have thrived over the centuries, the islanders have struggled. The island used to host a profitable seaweed business, harvesting two varieties of kelp - one known as ""tangles"" - which were used in the production of iodine and other chemicals. But last century it was discovered that it was cheaper to source the seaweed from South America. After that the island's population dwindled dramatically from 500 to just 50 today. David Beattie hopes that his research will help Scotland to re-establish commercial seaweed farming, creating jobs and revitalising coastal towns. ""Can you imagine the benefits if we could introduce seaweed into a supply chain as big as the livestock industry?"" he asks. He reminds me that seaweed, since it is grown in the sea, needs neither fresh water nor fertiliser and that, potentially, fields currently used for growing crops to put into animal feed could be reclaimed to grow food for human consumption. And one of Scotland's other big industries, salmon farming, could also benefit, David adds. Growing seaweed close to the farms helps protect the fish from sea lice - a major problem for salmon farmers - while the nitrogen excreted by the fish helps the seaweed grow. ""So, I really do think we stand to learn a lot from the seaweed-eating North Ronaldsay sheep,"" he says. The arrival on the island of Sian the sheep warden a few weeks ago was critically important partly because of the damage to the beautiful dry stone dyke caused by brutal storms and rip tides which battered the island's coastline in 2012 and 2014. Under the rules of the Sheep Court, it's up to the islanders who own the flock to repair any damage to the wall, which is listed Category A by Historic Scotland. But with a dwindling and ageing resident population, that's no longer possible. ""That's where I come in,"" laughs Sian good-naturedly, waving her spade. ""The young blood! I'm the great hope to make sure the sheep are confined to the shore and the seaweed!"" Worryingly, there have been several reports recently of ""loopers"", escapee sheep who have spotted a gap or a partially tumbled-down bit of wall and leapt over it, straying on to the rich grasslands on the forbidden side. Although ewes with newborn lambs are deliberately brought briefly on to the grass in the summer - the males, which are sent for slaughter, are never permitted to venture on to pasture - the sheep's stomachs are no longer adapted to grass and they risk copper poisoning if they eat too much. Just then we spot a sly looper skulking close to the wall. It's on the unauthorised side, its eyes darting towards the prohibited patch of green near our car. Alison finds a torn oil skin the sea has dumped on the shingles and prepares to try to catch it. ""Then we really have to work out how it got in,"" she tells Sian, the novice sheep warden. ""We will have to block up that entry point because as soon as a sheep finds a gap, he will tell his friends and before you know it, they're all on the grass or in your garden!"" She laughs. ""You see, sheep are very curious animals and for them, the grass is always greener on the other side!"" With amazing matador skill using the oil skin as a shield (Sian insists modestly that it's beginner's luck) the Houdini sheep is recaptured by the pair and after Alison examines his teeth (it turns out he doesn't have any, due to advanced age), together the women heave him on top of the dry stone wall where he teeters for a moment, as if weighing up his options, before he finally jumps back on to the beach side and gallops off on his spindly legs towards the waiting flock. We walk away from the beach and towards the old lighthouse where the retired GP and sheep owner, Kevin Woodbridge, shows me around the island's mill. Here the sheep's wool with its beautiful muted colours is spun into beanies, fleecy jumpers and soft yarn. The mill currently employs three people but is set to expand into new premises due to increasing demand for genuine North Ronaldsay garments. Kevin Woodbridge (left) and a member of staff at the mill ""I've always thought of our sheep as an organic product,"" Kevin says thoughtfully, when I ask him how he feels about the discovery that the island's sheep could help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. We look out over the beach where a small group of sheep are enthusiastically grazing on a fresh crop of moist seaweed the bigger waves have just delivered. ""We know we need to reduce our red meat consumption and if we can reduce the impact of red meat production as well, then that's really good news for the sheep."" Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint How a new diet for gassy cows is helping the environment The cows that could help fight climate change Alison and I sit in the warm breakfast room at the Bird Observatory watching a pair of hen harriers intently searching the fields for food. ""We would be really proud if scientists could learn from how our sheep are digesting seaweed and producing less methane,"" Alison tells me, putting down her binoculars. ""That could help all farmers reduce their carbon footprint and could give us a good bit of publicity for selling the sheep elsewhere."" It's getting dark now and having temporarily patched up the section of wall over which the looper made his bid for freedom, sheep warden Sian Tarrant decides to call it a day and cycle home. Opposite her house the little school stands quiet and empty. No children have been raised here for many years. I comment that I've heard that some islanders are pinning their hopes on her to change that. ""Yes, that has been mentioned to me!"" she agrees, laughing. ""But maybe let's sort the sheep problem first!"" Against the brooding, dark skyline, a cluster of sheep huddle together on a crop of rock as the wind continues to hurl along the length of the coastline. They scour the heaving waves patiently, waiting for the bigger ones to deliver their next seaweed dinner, which they will digest in their longstanding, idiosyncratic methane-modified way. Far away on the mainland, scientist David Beattie is experimenting with the nutritional make up of seaweed variants, and writing up notes for the speeches he will deliver at forthcoming European conferences on greener farming. As they graze in the moonlight, the North Ronaldsay sheep silently belch their satisfaction. Ruminant recognition doesn't get much better than this.

"House prices rose by 1.4% over the course of 2019, according to the Nationwide, marking a relatively static year for property values. The rise in the year to the end of December was the first time the annual increase in prices was above 1% for the whole year. Slow price growth would be welcomed by many first-time buyers. But the building society's figures show that raising a deposit remains a significant hurdle. To raise a deposit of 20% would take up the entire pre-tax annual income of a typical earner, the Nationwide said. The UK cities where rent is rising the fastest Most-viewed mansions of 2019 revealed The building society, which draws the figures from its own mortgage data, said that house prices rose by 0.1% in December compared with the previous month. This meant the average home was valued at Â£215,282. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said that housing market activity had been slow but relatively stable during the year. Strong employment levels and historically cheap mortgages had maintained demand despite uncertainty in the economy, owing to the global picture and the debate over Brexit. Homes are being built for first-time buyers Commentators suggest the result of the general election should provide some short-term clarity over the Brexit process and some more demand for housing. ""These are early days for a bruised and fragile market, but with plenty of pent-up demand and supply, price growth may quickly accelerate past 2019's modest annual pace,"" said Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. ""Nevertheless these first few months of 2020 will be all about establishing what the new norm really looks like in different parts of the UK."" Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of lender Octane Capital, said: ""London may have been the weakest performing region in 2019 but that may well change this year. The capital certainly won't be returning to the obscene growth rates of yesteryear but it may drag itself off the bottom of the table. ""The property market has entered 2020 on a positive note but all eyes will be on how the economy holds up as we exit the EU."" Potential first-time buyers will not want prices to rocket, given the difficulty already in saving for a deposit. The Nationwide suggests that anyone trying to put money aside for a 20% deposit to buy a typical first-time buyer property faces years of saving. If they set aside 15% of their take-home pay each month it would take more than five years to raise the money for a home in the North of England and Scotland. In Wales and Northern Ireland, it would take prospective buyers nearly seven years, and almost eight years for people living in the West Midlands. That increases to nearly a decade in the South of England, and around 15 years in London, the building society said. As a result of that pressure, a greater proportion of first-time buyers now rely on financial assistance from family and friends. Where can I afford to live?

"The IRGC is estimated to have more than 190,000 active personnel Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) was set up 40 years ago to defend the country's Islamic system, and to provide a counterweight to the regular armed forces. It has since become a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with close ties to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and many other senior figures. The IRGC is estimated to have more than 190,000 active personnel, boasts its own ground forces, navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons. It also controls the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force, which has helped suppress domestic dissent, and the powerful bonyads, or charitable foundations, which run a considerable part of the economy. The IRGC exerts influence elsewhere in the Middle East by providing money, weapons, technology, training and advice to allied governments and armed groups through its shadowy overseas operations arm, the Quds (Jerusalem) Force. The US accuses the Quds Force of supporting terrorist organisations and being responsible for attacks in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East that have resulted the deaths of hundreds of American and allied military personnel. On 3 January 2020, the US killed the Quds Force's powerful commander, Major General Qasem Soleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad. The defence department said he had orchestrated a rocket attack in Iraq that killed an American contractor and was ""actively developing plans to attack"" American diplomats and troops in the region. Ayatollah Khamenei called for ""forceful revenge"", raising fears of a major conflict. Before the 1979 revolution, Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi relied on military might to ensure national security and to safeguard his power. Afterwards, the new Islamic authorities, headed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, realised they too needed a powerful force committed to consolidating their leadership and revolutionary ideals. The IRGC was set up after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend Iran's Islamic system The clerics therefore produced a new constitution that provided for both a regular Military (Artesh), to defend Iran's borders and maintain internal order, and a separate Guard Corps (Sepah-e Pasdaran), to protect the Islamic system. In practice, these roles have often overlapped, with the IRGC also helping to keep public order and developing its own army, navy and air force. Despite having an estimated 230,000 fewer troops than the regular military, the IRGC is considered the dominant military force in Iran and is behind many of the country's key military operations. The IRGC's overall commander, currently Major General Hossein Salami, and other senior officers routinely advise the supreme leader. The IRGC navy is tasked with patrolling the strategically important Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway connecting the Gulf to the Indian Ocean through which 20% of the world's oil supply passes. The force's small boats have intercepted US warships that it says have approached Iran's territorial waters, and detained or diverted international shipping. The IRGC's air force oversees Iran's ballistic missile programme The IRGC's air force, which does not generally operate combat aircraft, is meanwhile responsible for Iran's missiles. The US has said Iran has the largest ballistic missile force in the Middle East,external, with more than 10 ballistic missile systems either in its inventory or in development, and a stockpile of hundreds of missiles. In 2018, ballistic missiles were fired at an Iranian Kurdish rebel group based in northern Iraq and at Islamic State group positions in Syria. But perhaps the most prominent IRGC entity in recent years has been the Quds Force, which Iran's government is said to use to implement its foreign policy goals. Iran has acknowledged the role of the Quds Force in the conflicts in Syria, where it has advised forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and armed thousands of Shia Muslim militiamen fighting alongside them, and Iraq, where it has backed a Shia-dominated paramilitary force that helped defeat IS. The conflicts turned the once-reclusive commander, General Soleimani, into a something of celebrity in Iran. Gen Qasem Soleimani commanded the IRGC's shadowy Quds Force The Trump administration has alleged that the Quds Force is also ""Iran's primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting"" US-designated terrorist groups across the Middle East - including Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - by providing funding, training, weapons, and equipment. The Quds Force has also been accused by the US of plotting or carrying out terrorist attacks, directly or through its proxies, in five out of seven continents. In 2011, the Quds Force was allegedly involved in a plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the US by bombing a restaurant in Georgetown. And last year, a court in Germany convicted a Quds Force operative of spying on the former head of a German-Israeli group and people close to him. Such alleged activities prompted the United States in April 2019 to designate the IRGC as a ""foreign terrorist organisation"" - the first such designation of an official military force. At the same time, the US tightened its sanctions on Iran's oil exports, further weakening its economy. In response, Iran began a counter-pressure campaign. The IRGC's forces shot down a US military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June and seized a British-flagged tanker in the same area the following month. The US also accused Iran of being behind a series of explosions that damaged six tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June; drone and cruise missile attacks on two Saudi oil facilities in September; a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base used by US troops on 27 December that killed the American contractor. Iran denied any involvement. There was a serious escalation in the confrontation between the US and Iran following the rocket attack. On 29 December, the US carried out air strikes on five bases in Iraq and Syria associated with the Iran-backed Iraqi militia that it believed fired the rockets, Kataib Hezbollah. The strikes killed at least 25 militia fighters and sparked violent protests outside the US embassy in Baghdad. Five days later, a US Reaper drone fired missiles at a convoy leaving the city's international airport, killing General Soleimani and several militia leaders, including Kataib Hezbollah chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The IRGC also has a powerful presence in Iran's civilian institutions. It controls the Basij Resistance Force (Mobilisation of the Oppressed), an Islamic volunteer militia of about 100,000 men and women. The Basij are loyalists to the revolution who are often called out onto the streets to use force to dispel dissent. The IRGC and Basij were prominent in putting down the mass opposition protests that erupted in 2009 after the disputed re-election of then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Dozens of opposition supporters were killed and thousands detained. The IRGC's popular power, combined with the strong support of Ayatollah Khamenei, has made it a key player in Iranian politics. Former IRGC officers occupy or have occupied influential positions in government, parliament and other bodies, among them Mr Ahmadinejad, parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, and Mohsen Rezaei, secretary of the Expediency Council. Serving IRGC officers also frequently criticise government policies. President Hassan Rouhani clashed with former IRGC commander Gen Mohamad Ali Jafari The former overall commander, Major General Mohammad Ali Jaafari, openly opposed the concessions made by moderate President Hassan Rouhani during the negotiations that led to Iran's 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers. The IRGC is also thought to control around a third of Iran's economy through a series of subsidiaries and trusts. Apart from military industries, the IRGC is active in housing development, dam and road construction, oil and gas projects, food, transportation and even educational and cultural activities. The IRGC's engineering wing - Khatam-ol-Anbia (Seal of the Prophet), also known by an acronym, Ghorb - is reported to have tens of thousands of employees and has been awarded billions of dollars of construction and engineering contracts. President Rouhani, who has faced protests over the state of Iran's economy, has on many occasions criticised the IRGC's sprawling business empire. He once called it a ""government with a gun"" that had ""scared"" the public sector.

"The bodies of Helen Hancock and Martin Griffiths were found by police on New Year's Day An estranged husband has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife and her new partner at a house in Derbyshire on New Year's Day. Helen Hancock, 39, and Martin Griffiths, 48, were found by police in New Zealand Lane, Duffield.

"Across Britain, people are spending more money on vegan products, and plant-based diets are trending online. With major supermarkets catching on and stocking up on vegan-friendly food - BBC News asks what's behind the rise? A vegan diet involves cutting out animal products like meat, fish, dairy and eggs. According to the latest research bythe Vegan Society,external, conducted in 2018, there are around 600,000 vegans in Great Britain.  600,000According to a Vegan Society survey of 2,000 people in 2018 Â£740mEstimated sales of meat-free foods in 2018 87%Most Veganuary participants in 2019 were female It's estimated that this is up from 150,000 in 2006, and that there are twice as many women than men who are vegan. Around 360,000 people also describe themselves as lifestyle vegans, who commit to only using or buying cosmetics and clothes free from animal products, for example. Supermarket chains in the UK are stocking more vegan options to keep up with consumers' food choices. In 2018 Waitrose introduced a dedicated vegan section in more than 130 shops, while Iceland reported that sales of its plant-based food have risen by 10% over the last year. How to date a vegan Tablets to smart speakers: The 2010s in spending And a range of fast-food companies, from Greggs to McDonalds and Burger King to KFC, have launched, or announced, vegan options for the UK. The UK market for meat-free foods was reportedly worth Â£740m in 2018, according to market researchersMintel,external, up from Â£539m only three years ago. Interest in vegetarian and vegan products shows no sign of slowing down, as retail sales are expected to increase to Â£658m by 2021. Social media has had a big part to play in the rise of the plant-based lifestyle. Celebrities like Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Ellen DeGeneres are some of the well-known figures who don't eat animal products, while #vegan has more than 87 million posts listed on Instagram. Veganism is a hot topic - the number of Google searches worldwide has also spiked in recent years. The search engine uses a number out of 100 to represent interest in a search term. In 2009, the word ""veganism"" had a peak popularity score of only 33 but it had increased to 100 only 10 years later. The top three most-searched questions on the topic in the UK ask what veganism is, about its sustainability and how it affects climate change. Giles Quick, director at market researcher Kantar Worldpanel, said: ""The vegan market has changed fundamentally in the last six or seven years - it's now for everyone. ""Social media has brought it to the forefront of customer's minds, and the mainstream. It's not seen any more as a choice for life, but as a choice for one meal, one moment, for one or two days a week."" Flexitarianism, part-time vegetarianism or veganism, is becoming more and more popular. And in January 2019, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan for the first month of the year, underthe Veganuary campaign. Launched in the UK in 2014, and supported by a wide range of social media, Veganuary encourages people ""to try vegan for January and beyond"". According to analysts, young women are driving the growth of the vegan movement. But, a range of reasons lie behind veganism's rise. A total of 49% of those interested in cutting down on their meat consumption said they would do so for health reasons, according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults in Great Britain by Mintel. Weight management, animal welfare and environmental concerns were also big motivators. With interest increasing all the time in healthy eating, part-time veganism might well become a full-time fixture in many people's lives. Update: This piece was originally published on 18 June 2018.

"This video can not be played Jordi Casamitjana says he's ""really really satisfied"" with the judge's ruling Ethical veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" and so is protected in law, a tribunal has ruled for the first time. The landmark legal case was brought by vegan Jordi Casamitjana, who claims he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports because of his ethical veganism. His former employer says he was dismissed for gross misconduct. The judge ruled that ethical vegans should be entitled to similar legal protections in British workplaces as those who hold religious beliefs. He is yet to rule on Mr Casamitjana's dismissal - which is due at a later date. Mr Casamitjana, 55, who lives in London, said he was ""extremely happy"" with the ruling - which is ongoing - adding that he hopes fellow vegans ""will benefit"". The tribunal centres on his claim that he was sacked by the animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing it invested pension funds in firms involved in animal testing. Mr Casamitjana says when he drew his bosses' attention to the pension fund investments, they did nothing so he informed colleagues and was sacked as a result. The League Against Cruel Sports says it is ""factually wrong"" to link Mr Casamitjana's dismissal to his veganism. The charity did not contest that ethical veganism should be protected. A vegan is someone who does not eat or use animal products. Some people choose to simply follow a vegan diet - that is, a plant-based diet avoiding all animal products such as dairy, eggs, honey, meat and fish. But ethical vegans try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation from their lifestyle. For instance, they avoid wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing. Why are more people going vegan? ""Religion or belief"" is one of nine ""protected characteristics"" covered by the Equality Act 2010. The judge Robin Postle ruled that ethical veganism qualifies as a philosophical belief under the Equality Act 2010 by satisfying several tests - including that it is worthy of respect in a democratic society, not incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with the fundamental rights of others. At the tribunal in Norwich on Friday, the judge said in his ruling that ethical veganism was ""important"" and ""worthy"" of respect in a democratic society. He said: ""I am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief."" By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Though a ruling from an employment tribunal does not amount to binding legal precedent, this one will have important and far-reaching effects. Employers will have to respect ethical veganism and make sure they do not discriminate against employees for their beliefs. So, for example, could a worker on a supermarket checkout refuse to put a meat product through the till? The implications are considerable, not least because the legal protection will apply beyond employment, in areas such as education and the supply of goods and services. It could also encourage others to seek similar protection for their philosophical beliefs. While this is the first case concerning ethical veganism, a previous tribunal ruled that a strongly held belief in climate change amounted to a philosophical belief capable of protecting someone against discrimination in their employment. Speaking to the BBC outside the tribunal, Mr Casamitjana said he was ""extremely happy"". ""I'm really, really satisfied and I hope all the vegans out there that have been supporting me - there have been many helping me in my crowdfunding - I hope they now feel their little donation has been properly used and all the vegans will benefit."" He added: ""Veganism is a philosophical belief and when you look at my life and anybody else's life who is an ethical vegan, you will see it. ""This is a positive belief, it's not a negative belief. And therefore a positive belief is bound to be protected."" Mr Casamitjana supports a range of ethical and animal rights causes He added that he is ""passionate"" about veganism, which ""gives you hope"". Mr Casamitjana also said he was feeling ""optimistic"" for the ruling on his dismissal. Mr Casamitjana describes himself as an ethical vegan and campaigns to get his message to others. His beliefs affect much of his everyday life. He will, for instance, walk rather than take a bus to avoid accidental crashes with insects or birds. Peter Daly, the solicitor for Mr Casamitjana, said the ramifications of this judgement for companies that employ vegan staff are ""potentially significant"". He said any abuse directed at ethical vegans ""might be seen to be harassment in the same way a racist or sexist slur might be discriminatory action"". Acting for the League Against Cruel Sports, Rhys Wyborn, from the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said: ""Although an interesting point of law, this hearing was preparation for the real crux of the matter: why Jordi Casamitjana was dismissed. ""In view of its animal welfare value, the League did not contest the issue of whether ethical veganism itself should be a protected belief, with the League maintaining that it's irrelevant to the core reason for the dismissal."" The tribunal will next consider whether Mr Casamitjana was treated less favourably because of his ethical veganism belief. Religion and belief is one of nine protected characteristics under the Equality Act. The others are age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, sex and sexual orientation.

"Boris Johnson was not warned about the US airstrike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian general, the BBC understands. The UK has 400 troops based in the Middle East and works alongside US forces in the region. But President Donald Trump did not tell the UK PM about the attack he orderedthat killed Qasem Soleimani on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has asked Mr Johnson to confirm what the UK was told before the airstrike. In a letter to the prime minister, he asked whether, if it had been informed in advance, the government had expressed its opposition to the attack. He also requested an urgent meeting of theprivy councilto discuss the airstrike's consequences, and asked what the government was doing to ensure the safety of UK nationals. Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq LIVE: Reaction as tensions escalate Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? Meanwhile Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said there was a ""pattern"" from the current White House not to share details with its allies, which was a ""matter of concern"". The former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee added: ""I have long believed the purpose of having allies is so we can surprise our enemies, not each other."" The death of Gen Soleimani ""will certainly be a huge blow to the Iranian regime"", but will ""doubtless have consequences"" elsewhere, Mr Tugendhat told BBC News. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did speak to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, although the time of the call is not known. Mr Pompeotweeted,externalthat he was ""thankful that our allies recognise the continuing aggressive threats posed by the Iranian Quds Force"". Mr Raab also issued a statement, urging ""all parties to de-escalate"" after the killing of Gen Soleimani. He said the UK ""recognised the aggressive threat"" Gen Soleimani posed, but ""further conflict is in none of our interests"". The Foreign and Commonwealth Office,externalhas warned British nationals to avoid any rallies, marches, or processions in Iran over the three days of national mourning the country has called for Gen Soleimani. As well as troops, there are around 400 British personnel based in Iraq - where the strike took place. The troops are there to train Iraqi forces tackling an Islamic State insurgency. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner earlier said he did not think anyone in the UK was given an indication the air strike was going to take place, adding: ""My sense is this has caught the British government largely by surprise."" The killing of Gen Soleimani marks a major escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""severe revenge awaits the criminals"" behind the attack, but a statement from the Pentagon said Gen Soleimani ""was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said earlier that the ""US assassination"" was an ""extremely serious and dangerous escalation"". Mr Corbyn said the UK ""should urge restraint"" from both Iran and the US - and called for the government to ""stand up to the belligerent actions and rhetoric coming from the United States"". He added: ""All countries in the region and beyond should seek to ratchet down the tensions to avoid deepening conflict, which can only bring further misery to the region, 17 years on from the disastrous invasion of Iraq."" The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said Iran was governed by ""a brutal regime"", but accused President Trump of ""yet again radically and recklessly escalated tensions in an area where peace-keeping was already on a knife edge"". He called for an immediate statement from Boris Johnson about the UK's position, adding: ""The UK should not automatically follow whatever position the Trump administration takes, but work with a broader group of concerned states at the United Nations.""

"High Street retailer Next has increased its profit forecast after enjoying better than expected sales over the Christmas trading period. The company's full-price sales rose by 5.2% from 27 October to 28 December, 1.1% ahead of its own expectations. It said that colder weather this November might have helped its sales performance. The firm now expects an annual profit of Â£727m, up by Â£2m - and an increase of 0.6% on the last year. Next expects sales to grow 3.9% over the current financial year. Next is the first of the big UK retailers to report on how trading went over Christmas, which is a crucial trading period for the sector. The retailer's good performance was boosted by an increase in online sales, which rose by 15.3% over the three-month period. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: ""This was an impressive end to the year as their outstanding online business continues to set them apart from the competition. ""The retailer is benefiting from years of investment in their digital proposition, continually evolving their business model to meet shoppers' heightened expectations."" 'The High Street is changing, but not dying' Ten brands that disappeared over the past decade Sainsbury's ex-boss urges VAT rise to save High Street However, while Next's online sales were strong, the continued shift away from the High Street was reflected by the fact that in-store sales saw a decrease of 3.9%. According to recent data by retail analyst Springboard, overall footfall in November on UK High Streets fell by 4.3%. It suggested shoppers might have been put off by heavy rainfall in the run-up to the festive season. Retailers including John Lewis, and Marks and Spencer will release their Christmas trading updates next week, as well as the big supermarkets - Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's. Earlier this week, Next announced that its former chief executive Sir David Jones had died, aged 76. He led the company for nearly 30 years, and was widely credited with saving the retail giant from collapse in the 1980s.

"Amazon Employees for Climate Justice lead a walkout at the company's headquarters in Seattle in September A group of Amazon employees has said the company has threatened to fire some of them for speaking out on environmental issues. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice said the workers were told they were in violation of company policies. It comes after employees joined calls for the e-commerce giant to do more to tackle climate change. The company said its policy on employees making public comments is not new and covers all of its workers. In a Twitter post, the group said some employees had been contacted by Amazon's legal and human resources teams and questioned about public comments they had made. The statement went on to say: ""Some workers then received follow-up emails threatening termination if they continue to speak about Amazon's business."" Allow Twitter content?

"The apprenticeship levy was intended to fund high-quality training Half of apprenticeship courses in England have been accused of being ""fake"" by an education think tank. The EDSK report says the apprenticeship levy - paid by big employers - is being used on low-skilled jobs or relabelling existing posts, rather than training. Tom Richmond, the think tank's director, said the apprenticeship scheme was ""descending into farce"". But a Department for Education spokeswoman defended apprenticeships as becoming ""better quality"". The apprenticeship levy is paid by large employers, who contribute 0.5% of their salary bill into the training fund. But since 2017, the report claims Â£1.2bn from the levy has been spent on jobs ""offering minimal training and low wages"" or on ""rebadging"" jobs already offered by employers as apprenticeships. In its first full year of operation, the levy raised Â£2.7bn and this is expected to rise to Â£3.4bn by 2023-24. Apprenticeship spending is too often used on ""existing adult workers instead of supporting young people into the workplace"", the report warns. Apprenticeships target to be missed Low-skill jobs being relabelled as apprenticeships Apprenticeship take-up down by quarter The education think tank says there is an insufficiently clear definition of what an apprenticeship should offer, so much so that the ""brand itself has arguably become a meaningless concept"". It describes 50% of apprenticeship courses since 2017 as ""fake"", saying they do not ""relate to helping young people get started in a skilled job or occupation"". Ministers say that the quality of apprenticeships is improving The think tank's analysis says that Â£235m of the levy has been used to support ""low-skill"" roles, such as bar staff, shop checkout workers and those in ""basic office administration"". A further Â£551m has been used by firms for management training, with the report claiming this was often used for experienced staff rather than new recruits and could include the ""rebadging"" of existing schemes. The most common apprenticeship is becoming a supervisor or team leader, representing about a tenth of all apprenticeships. The report also criticises Â£448m spent on apprenticeships aimed at degree and postgraduate level. This includes some academics with PhDs being labelled as apprentices in university training schemes in research and teaching. Bar staff and supermarket check-out workers can be apprentices, says research It also includes support for degree apprenticeships, which are offered as a vocational alternative to academic degrees. The report's claims were strongly rejected by Mark Dawe, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers. He said there was a need for a wide range of apprenticeships, including those at a lower level - and he accused the report of using ""caricatures"" which had ""no resemblance to the reality of what is actually being learnt"". A National Audit Office report into apprenticeships last year warned: ""There are risks that the programme is subsidising training that would have happened without government funding."" The former education secretary Damian Hinds last year told the education select committee that apprenticeships were improving in quality. But he had told MPs that ""in the not too distant past"" there had been people who did not even realise they were on an apprenticeship scheme. The new think tank report says apprenticeships need to be more carefully defined and targeted if they are to ""improve technical education for young people"". ""If the government wants apprenticeships to be taken seriously by young people, parents and teachers, they must protect this historic brand by scrapping all the 'fake apprenticeships' and benchmarking our training programmes against the best in the world,"" said Mr Richmond. ""Not only will this save hundreds of millions each year, it will provide more opportunities for young people to train as genuine apprentices, especially those living in the most deprived areas."" A spokesman for the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education, which oversees the development of apprenticeship standards, said: ""We work closely with thousands of employers to make high-quality apprenticeships available across the whole economy. ""This has led to a broader variety of apprenticeships up to degree level being made available, which reflects the nation's skills training needs,"" said the spokesman for the institute, which is funded through the Department for Education. A Department for Education spokeswoman defended the value of apprenticeships and said they had to meet ""high-quality requirements"". She said they lasted ""for a minimum of 12 months with at least 20% off-the-job training"" and could not be called an apprenticeship unless it complied with such regulations.

"Pope 56* - caught off no-ball on 56 England slip from 221-5 to 234-9 Pope adds unbroken 28 with Anderson Stokes 47, Denly 38, Root 35 Seamers share eight wickets England recall Crawley, Pope & Bess 2nd Test, Cape Town; Eng won toss SA lead 1-0 in four-Test series Stephan Shemilt and Jack Skelton You know the drill, big first session tomorrow and all that. I know, it's a Saturday, but no one goes out the Friday after new year, so I expect you to join us. See you then. #bbccricket Totum:We just batted through a whole day. As in a day. All of it. Batted it all. I know, 9 wickets but not 10. Little acorns and all that... So, once again, England need their bowlers to dig them out of one. Anderson and Broad have probably dug to the centre of the Earth over the course of their careers. Text 81111 Need to be looking at 280 being the target tomorrow morning. Couple of early SA wickets and it may look competitive. Dave in Warrington Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent in Cape Town England's bowlers have got to come out here and really work hard tomorrow. They have got lots of experience, but ageing legs - and not much pace. There is no Archer. Who's going to come and bowl a hostile spell? Ebony Rainford-BrentEx-England women's batter on The Cricket Social I'm going to flip the switch and give South Africa eight out of 10. They have come into this series in turmoil and really put in a solid performance. Six seems generous... Aatif NawazComedian on The Cricket Social It wasn't catastrophic - they have still got runs on the board. So six out of 10. Daniel NorcrossThe Cricket Social Marks out of 10 for England? Graham OnionsFormer England bowler on The Cricket Social England needed someone to go big - and they didn't. That's the most disappointing thing for me. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent in Cape Town For too long, England's batting hasn't produced what it should do. Graham OnionsFormer England bowler on The Cricket Social With the amount of attacking batsmen they have got, England need someone who can just block. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent in Cape Town Joe Denly had been batting for so long and missed a straight one. Ben Stokes drilled a ball to extra-cover. England have failed to capitalise on batting on a 350-plus wicket. You get the chance to bat first, you're 1-0 down in the series, it looks a good pitch, and the batsmen make starts... We should say that 262-9 means England aren't out of this game. They have at least got something on the board. And South Africa have to bat last. But, if the Proteas go big tomorrow, the tourists are in big trouble. Graham OnionsFormer England bowler on The Cricket Social 260-5 would have been an OK day. That is the frustrating thing - why do they keep getting in and keep getting out? That one ball is going to be really important for England tomorrow. Six of England's top seven got to 29. Only Ollie Pope, who remains on 56 not out, got past fifty. That tells its own tale. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent in Cape Town England will be bitterly disappointed. There have been one or two glimpses from this pitch of what might happen later in the game, but England have missed out here. There's applause and cheers from the travelling fans but, make no mistake, this is South Africa's day. Yes, they still have to find a way of taking the final wicket tomorrow, but 262-9 appears to be well short of where England should be after winning the toss and batting first in ideal conditions. There are fielders spread far and wide as Nortje comes in to Pope. Have they stopped trying to get him out? It's complete folly, because Pope isn't taking the runs on offer. Pope ignores the fifth ball. He's facing the final delivery of the day... Graham OnionsFormer England bowler on The Cricket Social That is a massive no-ball - the umpire should be calling that.

"Testicular cancer can be treated successfully with fewer rounds of toxic chemotherapy drugs, doctors say. A study on 246 patients, reportedin the journal European Urology,external, showed a single cycle of chemo was just as effective as the standard two cycles. But the ""shorter, kinder and cheaper"" approach reduced the side-effects for cancer patients, scientists said. Experts believe having less chemotherapy would make a ""huge difference"" to quality of life. Testicular cancer is quite rare, affecting around 2,400 people in the UK each year. However, it is unusual in that it strikes relatively young men - it is the most common type of cancer in those aged between 15 and 49. The overwhelming majority of people diagnosed (98%) survivefor at least 10 years,externalafter the cancer is first detected. But as it affects people relatively young, the side-effects of treatment could last a lifetime. The study, by the Institute of Cancer Research, London and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, was trying to reduce side-effects. This video can not be played After Andrew Lowden's blog was shared widely, he launched #testicletuesday to raise awareness Patients in the trial - who were thought to be at high risk of the cancer coming back - were given just one course of chemotherapy. Two years later, the cancer had recurred in only 1.3% of men - which is roughly the same number as those having the standard two courses. Prof Robert Huddart, from the Institute of Cancer Research, said: ""Reducing the overall dose of chemotherapy could spare young men who have their whole lives ahead of them from long-term side-effects, and also means they will need fewer hospital visits for their treatment. ""This new trial is already changing clinical practice on a global scale."" Chemotherapy can damage the immune system, increasing the risk of infections, damage organs - including the kidneys - and affect fertility. Prof Emma Hall, another scientist at the institute, said: ""Our study has found strong evidence to suggest that testicular cancer chemotherapy can be safely reduced from two cycles to just one - making their treatment shorter, kinder and cheaper."" Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head information nurse, said: ""Providing men with a kinder treatment option linked to fewer side-effects could make a huge difference to their quality of life.

"Rami Malek won an Oscar for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody Bohemian Rhapsody's success at the box office in 2018 was replicated in the living room last year. The Freddie Mercury biopic was the biggest home video of 2019, selling 1.7 million copies in the UK. Two-thirds of those copies were on DVD or Blu-Ray, with the rest coming from downloads. Overall, UK consumer spending on video grew by 9.5%, making it the fastest-growing entertainment sector, fuelled by the popularity of streaming. Data compiled by the ERA (Entertainment Retailers Association) shows that physical video sales - which include DVDs, Blu-rays and 4K UHD - decreased from Â£616.9m in 2018 to Â£477.2m last year, a drop of 22.6%. By contrast, digital video grew by 21.5% to Â£2.11bn in 2019, fuelled in part by increased take-up of services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Bohemian Rhapsody closes in on $1bn box office ""There is no doubt retailers of physical product had a tough time in 2019,"" said the Entertainment Retailers Association's CEO Kim Bayley. According to BASE (British Association for Screen Entertainment), ""the digital revolution... is increasingly permeating the choices consumers are making for owned media"". Yet the organisation - previously known as the British Video Association (BVA) - says the physical disc is ""still the preferred choice for many fans, collectors and gifters"". The greatest decline in the video sector is found in the physical rental of discs, which fell by almost 25% in 2019. Yet this part of the market still generated Â£23.4m last year, despite firms like Blockbuster vanishing from the high street over the last decade. Bohemian Rhapsody shifted almost 400,000 more units last year than its nearest competitor Avengers: Endgame, which sold just over 1.3 million copies. Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing film of all time in 2019 Other titles in 2019's Top 10 of best-selling videos in the UK include Toy Story 4, Mary Poppins Returns and the Lady Gaga remake of A Star is Born. ""Video's digital renaissance is remarkable, but it is undeniable that physical formats are the key to scoring a blockbuster hit,"" said ERA CEO Bayley. ""Every one of the year's Top 10 biggest hits sold more on DVD and Blu-ray than they did digitally."" The data released on Friday follows confirmation on Wednesday thatmusic consumption grew in 2019 for the fifth year in a row. Figures released by trade body the BPI show the music industry is now dominated by streaming, with sales of physical CDs continuing to decline.

By contrast, digital video grew by 21.5% to Â£2.11bn in 2019, fuelled in part by increased take-up of services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Bohemian Rhapsody closes in on $1bn box office ""There is no doubt retailers of physical product had a tough time in 2019,"" said the Entertainment Retailers Association's CEO Kim Bayley. According to BASE (British Association for Screen Entertainment), ""the digital revolution... is increasingly permeating the choices consumers are making for owned media"". Yet the organisation - previously known as the British Video Association (BVA) - says the physical disc is ""still the preferred choice for many fans, collectors and gifters"". The greatest decline in the video sector is found in the physical rental of discs, which fell by almost 25% in 2019. Yet this part of the market still generated Â£23.4m last year, despite firms like Blockbuster vanishing from the high street over the last decade. Bohemian Rhapsody shifted almost 400,000 more units last year than its nearest competitor Avengers: Endgame, which sold just over 1.3 million copies. Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing film of all time in 2019 Other titles in 2019's Top 10 of best-selling videos in the UK include Toy Story 4, Mary Poppins Returns and the Lady Gaga remake of A Star is Born. ""Video's digital renaissance is remarkable, but it is undeniable that physical formats are the key to scoring a blockbuster hit,"" said ERA CEO Bayley. ""Every one of the year's Top 10 biggest hits sold more on DVD and Blu-ray than they did digitally.""

"Switch on the television in Iran these days and it won't be long before you see General Qasem Soleimani. The once reclusive head of the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force has emerged from a lifetime in the shadows directing covert operations abroad, to achieve almost celebrity status in Iran. The man who, until a couple of years ago most Iranians would not have recognised on the street, is now the subject of documentaries, news reports and even pop songs. Onemusic video,externalwidely shared in Iran was made by Shia militia fighters in Iraq.  It shows soldiers spray-painting the general's portrait on a wall and parading in front of it while stirring music plays in the background. The general himself is currently in Salahuddin province in northern Iraq, commanding Iraqi and Shia militias as they try to recapture the city of Tikrit from Islamic State (IS). Iran's Fars News agency has published photographs of him with the troops, and militia sources in Iraq have told BBC Persian he has been there for some time helping the Iraqis prepare for the mission. It is not the first time Gen Soleimani has faced the jihadists. In neighbouring Syria he is widely credited with delivering the strategy that has helped President Bashar al-Assad turn the tide against rebel forces and recapture key cities and towns. Iran has always denied deploying boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq, but every now and then holds public funerals for security forces and ""military advisers"" who were killed in these two countries. Qasem Soleimani has made a point of attending some of these ceremonies. Iran and the United States may be arch-enemies on the ideological front, but the IS offensive in Iraq has led to indirect co-operation between the two. It's a path Gen Soleimani has trodden before. In 2001, Iran provided military intelligence to the US to support its invasion to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan, and in 2007 Washington and Tehran sent representatives to Baghdad for face-to-face talks over the deteriorating security situation there. Gen Soleimani has risen to prominence directing the counter-offensive against IS in Iraq Back then former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki was battling spiralling sectarian violence. In an interview for a BBC Persian documentary two years ago, former US ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker recalled the crucial behind-the-scenes role played by Gen Soleimani in the Baghdad talks. ""[Iran's ambassador to Iraq] called repeatedly for breaks,"" he said. ""I couldn't quite figure out why, and then later discovered that whenever I said something that he didn't have covered in his points, he would need to call back to Tehran for guidance - he was that tightly controlled. On the other end of the phone was Qasem Soleimani."" Mr Crocker also felt Gen Soleimani's influence when he served as US ambassador to Afghanistan. ""My Iranian interlocutors on Afghanistan made clear that while they kept the foreign ministry informed, ultimately it was Gen Soleimani that would make the decisions,"" he told the BBC. Over the last few years, Gen Soleimani's role in Iran's foreign affairs has become more public. He is no longer the hidden figure at the end of the phone line. These days he is the proud face of Iran, the go-to man when a crisis happens. Last month at the prestigious Fajr Film Festival in Tehran one of the winners dedicated his award to Gen Soleimani. It was even announced that he would be one of the supervisors in the production of a new film Iran is making about his old adversary Saddam Hussein. But not everyone is happy about the general's meteoric rise. In December 2014 at the Manama Dialogue security summit, there was a sharp exchange of views between Canadian and Iranian participants over the role of Gen Soleimani. Canada's then-foreign minister, John Baird, branded him an ""agent of terror in the region disguised as a hero"" fighting IS. Iran's former nuclear negotiator Hassan Mousavian rose to the defence, accusing the minister of ""spending time in palaces and luxury hotels while General Soleimani has risked his life to fight against IS terrorists"". Inside Iran a campaign has started among conservative bloggers for Gen Soleimani to go into politics.  They have dubbed him Iran's most honest and least corrupt politician and are calling for him to put his uniform aside and stand for president in 2017. Even the first deputy speaker of the Iranian Parliament has lent his support. ""His political analysis is no less than the Iranian Supreme Leader or Hassan Nasrallah, head of the Lebanese Hezbollah,"" said Mohammad-Reza Bahonar three months ago. But not all Iranians share the enthusiasm. Some political activists are deeply worried at the prospect of the Revolutionary Guards taking control of the presidential palace. They point to Egypt where the military have reasserted control, warning that the general now fighting Islamic State could turn out to be the ""al-Sisi"" of Iran.

"Carlos Ghosn, pictured making a media statement in April 2019, landed in Lebanon on New Year's Eve Lebanon has received a ""red notice"" from Interpol for the arrest of fugitive ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn. The request was received by Lebanon's internal security forces on Thursday and is yet to be referred to the judiciary, Reuters news agency reports. Mr Ghosn, who was facing trial in Japan for alleged financial misconduct, arrived in Beirut on New Year's Eve. The private jet on which he escaped reportedly landed in Istanbul first, prompting an investigation by Turkey. According to Turkish media, seven arrests have been made in connection with the case - four pilots, a cargo company manager and two airport workers. The car industry's driven 'cost killer' Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Four charts on the scandal An Interpol ""red notice"" is a request to police across the world to provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or other similar legal action. However, Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Ghosn was released on bail last April and reportedly spent months planning his escape The businessman holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, and has made extensive investments in banking and real estate in Lebanon. France has said it will not extradite him if he arrives in the country. Mr Ghosn had posted 1bn yen (Â£6.8m; $8.9m) in bail in Japan last April, ahead of his trial. He said on his arrival in Lebanon he had ""escaped injustice and political persecution"". On Thursday Mr Ghosn said media speculation that his wife had played a role in his escape was ""inaccurate and false"", adding: ""I alone arranged for my departure."" Meanwhile, two Lebanese lawyers lodged a criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn for visiting Israel in January 2008, the National News Agency reported. They argued he had defied a ban on nationals entering Israel, with which Lebanon is still technically at war. It is now up to Lebanon's public prosecutor's office to decide whether to uphold the complaint. According to Turkish media, Mr Ghosn's private jet landed at Istanbul's Ataturk airport at 05:30 (02:30 GMT) on Monday, having flown from Japan's Kansai airport in Osaka. The Hurriyet news website quoted interior ministry officials as saying that Turkish border police had not been told Mr Ghosn was on the plane and he had not been registered as entering or leaving the country. However, there has been no official comment on the case. French Finance Minister AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher said Mr Ghosn ""should not have absconded from the Japanese justice system"", but added: ""France never extradites its nationals."" Mr Ghosn, who was also boss of French car-maker Renault, has been under investigation in France but no charges have been laid. Mr Ghosn had three passports - Brazilian, French and Lebanese - which had been surrendered to his legal team in Japan. The team maintains it was still in possession of them when he left. Media reports now say he may have legally been in possession of a fourth passport to show his identity on some internal trips within Japan, but it would have been in a locked box or case, and his lawyers would have had the code. There is no record of him using a passport to leave Japan, so investigators there believe he used illegal means. Reuters on Thursday quoted sources close to Mr Ghosn as saying he decided to flee after finding out his trial had been delayed until April 2021. This video can not be played Mr Ghosn's wife Carole told the BBC in June that Japanese officials were trying to humiliate her husband They said he was also ""distressed"" at being prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, who is in Lebanon.

"The PM's senior adviser has called for changes to how government works, saying there are ""profound problems"" with how decisions are made. In ablog post,external, Dominic Cummings said the civil service lacked people with ""deep expertise in specific fields"". He said he wanted ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government. But a civil servants' union said currently staff were recruited on merit and ""because of what you can do, not what you believe"". The union also said recruiting world-class experts is hampered by the ""government's failure to pay a market rate"". Is Cummings right about civil service churn? In an unusual move, Mr Cummings also called for people keen to work in Downing Street to get in touch with him via a private Gmail address. The former Vote Leave campaign director said he wanted to hear from ""an unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds"", some to work as special advisers and ""perhaps some as officials"". He said No 10 was keen to recruit data scientists, software developers and economists to improve the performance of government. In his blog, Mr Cummings added: The aim of the new recruits is to improve performance but also make Mr Cummings himself ""much less important â and within a year largely redundant"" A junior applicant will become his personal assistant for a year - a role which will involve ""very interesting work and lots of uninteresting trivia that makes my life easier which you won't enjoy"". The job will be so exhausting that ""frankly it will be hard having a boy/girlfriend at all"" He also urged against applications from ""confident public school bluffers"" and added anyone who plays office politics ""will be discovered and immediately binned"" He wants to hire ""some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole"" Mr Cummings added that the Conservatives' 80-seat majority meant ministers would try to solve political problems without worrying about ""short-term unpopularity"". ""The point of this government is to do things differently and better and this always looks messy,"" he wrote. ""We do not care about trying to 'control the narrative' and all that New Labour junk."" Cummings: Anger at MPs over Brexit not surprising Who is Dominic Cummings? He added that officials should be encouraged to stay in their roles for longer so that they are able to build up expertise in particular policy areas. ""Shuffling some people who are expected to be general managers is a natural thing but it is clear Whitehall does this too much,"" he said. ""There are not enough people with deep expertise in specific fields."" Responding to the blog, the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said Mr Cummings had not clarified how new recruits would be selected or what their role within government would be. Dave Penman, the union's general secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The civil service is recruited on merit, it's a really fundamental principle. ""You are employed in the civil service because of what you can do, not what you believe."" ""If you surround yourself with people who are recruited simply because they believe the same as you believe, and whose employment is at your behest, is that the best way for the civil service or advisers to speak truth unto power? ""I don't think it is, and I think some of those approaches are quite dangerous as well."" In a statement, he added: ""It would be ironic if, in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded individuals - recruited for what they believe, not what they can do - and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want."" Mr Penman also said senior officials moved between different jobs in an effort to boost their pay after a ""decade of pay restraint"" within the civil service. Mr Cummings's desire to recruit experts might prove difficult because of pay rates, he added, which he said were ""typically half of those paid elsewhere"". ""All senior civil service roles are already open to external competition, yet time and again, government's failure to pay a market rate restricts the pool,"" he added. ""There's no word on this in his blog, or on addressing the longer term pay restraint that has created these issues."" It comes after Rachel Wolf, who co-wrote the Conservatives' election manifesto, said ""seismic"" changes to the civil service were being planned by No 10. Writingin the Daily Telegraph,external, Ms Wolf said Mr Cummings believed changing how government works was a ""prerequisite"" to delivering on promises made to the voters by the Conservatives during last month's election campaign. She said officials should get more training in science-related skills, and ""reorient"" policy decisions towards the public rather than ""special interests"". She also added that regularly moving civil servants between different departments ""kills institutional memory and expertise"". Dominic Cummings: How does he now earn a living?
